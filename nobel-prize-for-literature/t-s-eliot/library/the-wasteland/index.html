				<p>Part 1 &#8211; Burial of the Dead</p>
<p>
April is the cruellest month, breeding<br />
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing<br />
Memory and desire, stirring<br />
Dull roots with spring rain.<br />
Winter kept us warm, covering<br />
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding<br />
A little life with dried tubers.<br />
Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee<br />
With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,<br />
And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten<br />
And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.<br />
Bin gar keine Russin, stamm&#8217; aus Litauen, echt deutsch.<br />
And when we were children, staying at the arch-duke&#8217;s,<br />
My cousin&#8217;s, he took me out on a sled,<br />
And I was frightened. He said, Marie,<br />
Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.<br />
In the mountains, there you feel free.<br />
I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.</p>
<p>
What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow<br />
Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man, <br />
You canot say, or guess, for you know only<br />
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,<br />
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,<br />
And the dry stone no sound of water. Only<br />
There is shadow under this red rock,<br />
(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),<br />
And I will show you something different from either<br />
Your shadow at evening rising to meet you;<br />
I will show you fear in a handfull of dust.<br />
Frish weht der Wind<br />
Der Heimat zu<br />
Mein Irisch Kind,<br />
Wo weilest du?<br />
&#8216;You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;<br />
They called me the hyacinth girl.&#8217;<br />
&#8211;Yet when we came back, late, from the hyacinth garden,<br />
Your arms full and your hair wet, I could not<br />
Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither<br />
Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,<br />
Looking into the heart of light, the silence.<br />
Oed&#8217;und leer das Meer.</p>
<p>Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,<br />
Had a bad cold, nevertheless<br />
Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,<br />
With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she,<br />
Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor,<br />
(Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)<br />
Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,<br />
The lady of situations.<br />
Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,<br />
And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,<br />
Which is blank, is something he carries on his back,<br />
Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find<br />
The Hanged Man. Fear death by water. <br />
I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.<br />
Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,<br />
Tell her I bring the horoscope myself:<br />
One must be so careful these days.</p>
<p>Unreal City,<br />
Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,<br />
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,<br />
I had not thought death had undone so many.<br />
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,<br />
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.<br />
Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,<br />
To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours<br />
With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.<br />
There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: &#8216;Stetson!<br />
&#8216;You who were with me in the ships at Mylae<br />
&#8216;That corpse you planted last year in your garden,<br />
&#8216;Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?<br />
&#8216;Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?<br />
&#8216;O keep the Dog far hence, that&#8217;s friend to men,<br />
&#8216;Or with his nails he&#8217;ll dig it up again!<br />
&#8216;You! hypocrite lecteur!&#8211;mon semblable,&#8211;mon frere!&#8217;</p>
<p>
Part 2 &#8211; A Game of Chess</p>
<p>
The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne,<br />
Glowed on the marble, where the glass<br />
Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines<br />
From which a golden Cupidon peeped out<br />
(Another hid his eyes behind his wing)<br />
Doubled the flames of seven-branched candleabra<br />
Reflecting light upon the table as<br />
The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it,<br />
From satin cases poured in rich profusion.<br />
In vials of ivory and coloured glass<br />
Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfume<br />
Unguent, powdered, or liquid&#8211;troubled, vondused<br />
And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air<br />
That freshened from the window, these ascended<br />
In fattening the prolonged candle-flames,<br />
Flung their smoke into the laquearia,<br />
Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling.<br />
Huge sea-wood fed with copper<br />
Burned green and orange, framed by the colored stone<br />
In which sad light a carved dolphin swam<br />
Above the antique mantel was displayed<br />
As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene<br />
The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king<br />
So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale<br />
Filled all the desert with inviolable voice<br />
And still she cried, and still the world pursues,<br />
&#8216;Jug Jug&#8217; to dirty ears.<br />
And other withered stumps of time<br />
Were told upon the walls; staring forms<br />
Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.<br />
Footstpes shuffled on the stair.<br />
Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair<br />
Spread out in fiery points<br />
Glowed into words, then would be savagely still.</p>
<p>&#8216;My nerves are bad t-night. Yes, bad. Stay with me.<br />
&#8216;Speak to me. Why do you never speak? Speak.<br />
&#8216;What are you thinking of? What thinking? What?<br />
&#8216;I never know what you are thinking. Think.&#8217;</p>
<p>I think we are in rat&#8217;s alley<br />
Where the dead men lost their bones.</p>
<p>&#8216;What is that noise?&#8217;<br />
The wind under the door.<br />
&#8216;What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?&#8217;<br />
Nothing again nothing.<br />
&#8216;Do <br />
&#8216;You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember<br />
&#8216;Nothing?&#8217;<br />
I remember<br />
Those pearls that were his eyes.<br />
&#8216;Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?&#8217;<br />
But<br />
O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag&#8211;<br />
It&#8217;s so elegant<br />
So intelligent<br />
&#8216;What shall I do now? What shall I do?&#8217;<br />
&#8216;I shall rush out as I am, walk the street<br />
&#8216;With my hair down, so. What shall we do to-morrow?<br />
&#8216;What shall we ever do?<br />
The hot water at ten.<br />
And if it rains, a closed car at four.<br />
And we shall play a game of chess,<br />
Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door.</p>
<p>When Lil&#8217;s husband got demobbed, I said&#8211;<br />
I didn&#8217;t mince my words, I said to her myself,<br />
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME<br />
Now Albert&#8217;s coming back, make yourself a bit smart.<br />
He&#8217;ll want to know what you done with that money he gave you<br />
To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there.<br />
You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set,<br />
He said, I swear, I can&#8217;t bear to look at you.<br />
And no more can&#8217;t I, I said, and think of poor Albert,<br />
He&#8217;s been in the army for four years, he wants a good time<br />
And if you don&#8217;t give it him, there&#8217;s others will, I said.<br />
Oh is there, she said. Something o&#8217; that, I said.<br />
Then I&#8217;ll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look.<br />
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME<br />
If you don&#8217;t like it you can get on with it, I said.<br />
Others can pick and choose if you can&#8217;t.<br />
But if Albert makes off, it won&#8217;t be for lack of telling.<br />
You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique.<br />
(And her thirty-one.)<br />
I can&#8217;t help it, she said, pulling a long face,<br />
It&#8217;s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said.<br />
(She had five already and nearly died of young George.)<br />
The chemist said it would be all right, but I&#8217;ve never been the same.<br />
You are a proper fool, I said.<br />
Well, if Albert won&#8217;t leave you alone, there it is, I said,<br />
What you get married for if you don&#8217;t want children?<br />
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME<br />
Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon<br />
And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it&#8211;<br />
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME<br />
HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME<br />
Goodnight Bill. Goodnight Lou. Goodnight May. Goodnight.<br />
Ta ta. Goodnight. Goodnight.<br />
Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.</p>
<p>
Part 3 &#8211; The Fire Sermon</p>
<p>
The river&#8217;s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf<br />
Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind<br />
Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.<br />
Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.<br />
The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,<br />
Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends<br />
Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed.<br />
And their friends, the loitering heirs of City directors;<br />
Departed, have left no addresses.<br />
By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept&#8230;<br />
Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,<br />
Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.<br />
But at my back in a cold blast I hear<br />
The ratttle of bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.</p>
<p>A rat crept softly through vegetation<br />
Dragging its slimy belly on the bank<br />
While I was fishing in the dull canal<br />
On a winter evening round behind the gashouse<br />
Musing upon the king my brother&#8217;s wreck<br />
And the king my father&#8217;s death before him.<br />
White bodies naked on the low damp ground<br />
And bones cast in a little low dry garret,<br />
Rattled by the rat&#8217;s foot only, year to year.<br />
But at my back from time to time I hear<br />
The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring<br />
Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.<br />
O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter<br />
And on her daughter<br />
They wash their feet in soda water<br />
Et O ces voix d&#8217;enfants, chantant dans la coupole!</p>
<p>Twit twit twit <br />
Jug jug jug jug jug jug <br />
So rudely forc&#8217;d<br />
Tereu</p>
<p>Unreal City<br />
Under the brown fog of a winter noon<br />
Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant<br />
Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants<br />
C.i.f. London: documents at sight,<br />
Asked me in demotic French<br />
To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel<br />
Followed by a weekend at the Metropole.</p>
<p>At the violet hour, when the eyes and back<br />
Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits<br />
Like a taxi throbbing waiting,<br />
I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives,<br />
Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see<br />
At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives<br />
Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,<br />
The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights<br />
Her stove, and lays out food; in tins.<br />
Out of the window perilously spread<br />
Her drying combinations touched by the sun&#8217;s last rays,<br />
On the divan are piled (at night her bed)<br />
Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.<br />
I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs<br />
Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest&#8211;<br />
I too awaited the expected guest.<br />
He, the young man carbuncular, arrives,<br />
A small house agent&#8217;s clerk, with one bold stare,<br />
One of the low on whom assurance sits<br />
As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire.<br />
The time is now propitious, as he guesses,<br />
The meal is ended, she is bored and tired,<br />
Endeavours to engage her in caresses<br />
Which are still unreproved, if undesired.<br />
Flushed and decided, he assaults at one;<br />
Exploring hands rencounter no defence;<br />
His vanity requires no response,<br />
And makes a welcome of indifference.<br />
(And I Tiresias have foresuffered all<br />
Enacted on this same divan or bed;<br />
I who have sat by Thebes below the wall<br />
And walked amongh the lowest of the dead.)<br />
Bestows one final patronising kiss,<br />
And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit&#8230;</p>
<p>She turns and looks a moment in the glass,<br />
Hardly aware of her departed love;<br />
Her brain allows one-half formed thought to pass:<br />
&#8216;Well now that&#8217;s done: and I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s over.&#8217;<br />
When lovely woman stoops to folly and<br />
Paces about her room again, alone,<br />
She smooths her hair with automatic hand,<br />
And puts a record on the gramaphone.</p>
<p>&#8216;This music crept by me upon the waters&#8217;<br />
And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.<br />
O City city, I can sometimes hear<br />
Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,<br />
The pleasant whining of a mandolin<br />
And a clatter and a chatter from within<br />
Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls<br />
Of Magnus Martyr hold<br />
Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.</p>
<p>The river sweats<br />
Oil and tar<br />
The barges drift<br />
With the turning tide<br />
Red sails<br />
Wide<br />
To leeward, swing on the heavy spar.<br />
The barges wash<br />
Drifting logs<br />
Down Greenwich reach<br />
Past the Isle of Dogs.<br />
Weialala leia<br />
Wallala leialala</p>
<p>
Elizabeth and Leicester<br />
Beating oars<br />
The stern was formed<br />
A gilded shell<br />
Red and gold<br />
The brisk swell<br />
Rippled both shores<br />
Southwest wind<br />
Carried down stream<br />
The peal of bells<br />
White towers<br />
Weialala leia<br />
Wallala leialala</p>
<p>&#8216;Trams and dusty trees<br />
Highbury bore me. Richmond and Kew<br />
Undid me. By Richmond I raised my knees<br />
Supine on the floor of a narrow canoe.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;My feet are Moorgate, and my heart<br />
Under my feet. After the event<br />
He wept. He promisd &#8220;a new start.&#8221;<br />
I made no comment. What should I resent?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;On Margate Sands.<br />
I can connect<br />
Nothing with nothing.<br />
The broken fingernails of dirty hands.<br />
My people humble people who expect<br />
Nothing.&#8217;<br />
la la</p>
<p>To Carthage then I came</p>
<p>Burning burning burning burning<br />
O Lord Thou pluckest me out<br />
O Lord Thou pluckest</p>
<p>burning</p>
<p>
Part 4 &#8211; Death by Water</p>
<p>
Phelbas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,<br />
Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell<br />
And the profit and loss.<br />
A current under sea<br />
Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell<br />
He passed the stages of his age and youth<br />
Entering whirpool.<br />
Gentile or Jew<br />
O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,<br />
Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.</p>
<p>
Part 5 &#8211; What the Thunder Said</p>
<p>
After the torchlight red on sweaty faces<br />
After the frosty silence in the gardens<br />
After the agony in stony places<br />
The shouting and the crying<br />
Prison and palace and reverberation<br />
Of thunder of spring over distant mountains<br />
He who was living is now dead<br />
We who were living are now dying<br />
With a little patience</p>
<p>Here is no water but only rock<br />
Rock and no water and the sandy road<br />
The road winding above among the mountains<br />
Which are mountains of rock without water<br />
If there were water we should stop and drink<br />
Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think<br />
Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand<br />
If there were only water amongst the rock<br />
Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit<br />
Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit<br />
There is not even slience in the mountains<br />
But dry sterile thunder without rain<br />
There is not even solitude in the mountains<br />
But red sullen faces sneer and snarl<br />
From doors of mudcracked houses<br />
If there were water<br />
And no rock<br />
If there were rock<br />
And also water<br />
And water<br />
A spring<br />
A pool among the rock<br />
If there were the sound of water only<br />
Not the cicada <br />
And dry grass singing<br />
But sound of water over a rock<br />
Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees<br />
Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop<br />
But there is no water</p>
<p>Who is the third who walks always beside you?<br />
When I count, there are only you and I together<br />
But when I look ahead up the white road<br />
There is always another one walking beside you<br />
Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded<br />
I do not know whether a man or a woman<br />
&#8211;But who is that on the other side of you?</p>
<p>What is that sound high in the air<br />
Murmur of maternal lamentation<br />
Why are those hooded hordes swarming<br />
Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth<br />
Ringed by the flat horizon only<br />
What is the city over the mountains<br />
Cracks and reforms and burst in the violet air<br />
Falling towers<br />
Jerusalem Athens Alexandria<br />
Vienna London<br />
Unreal</p>
<p>A woman drew her long black hair out tight<br />
And fiddled whisper music on those strings<br />
And bats with baby faces in the violet light<br />
Whistled, and beat their wings<br />
And crawled head downward down a blackened wall<br />
And upsdie down in air were towers<br />
Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours<br />
And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells</p>
<p>In this decayed hole among the mountains<br />
In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing<br />
Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel<br />
There is an empty chapel, on the wind&#8217;s home.<br />
It has no windows, and the door swings,<br />
Dry bones can harm no one.<br />
Only a cock stood on the rooftree<br />
Co co rico co co rico<br />
In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust<br />
Bringing rain<br />
Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves<br />
Waited for rain, while the black clouds<br />
Gathered far distant, over Himavant.<br />
The jungle crouched, humped in silence.<br />
Then spoke the thunder<br />
DA<br />
Datta: what have we give?<br />
My friend, blood shaking my heart<br />
The awful daring of a moment&#8217;s surrender<br />
Which an age of prudence can never retract<br />
By this, and this only, we have existed<br />
Which is not to be found in our obituaries<br />
Or in memories draped by the beneficient spider<br />
Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor<br />
In our empty rooms<br />
DA<br />
Dayadhvam: I have heard the key<br />
Turn in the door once and turn once only<br />
We think of the key, each in his prison<br />
Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison<br />
Only at nightfall, aethereal rumours<br />
Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus<br />
DA<br />
Damyata: The boat responded<br />
Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar<br />
The sea was calm, your heart would have responded<br />
Gaily, when invited, beating obedient<br />
To controlling hands<br />
I sat upon the shore<br />
Fishing, with arid plain behind me<br />
Shall I at least set my lands in order?<br />
London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down<br />
Poi s&#8217;ascose nel foco che gli affina<br />
Quando fiam uti chelidon&#8211;O swallow swallow<br />
Le Prince d&#8217;Aquitaine a la tour abolie<br />
These fragments I have shored against my ruins<br />
Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo&#8217;s mad againe.<br />
Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata.<br />
Shantih shantih shantih
