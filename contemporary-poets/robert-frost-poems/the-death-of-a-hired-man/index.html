				<p>Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table<br />
Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step,<br />
She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage<br />
To meet him in the doorway with the news<br />
And put him on his guard. &#8216;Silas is back.&#8217;<br />
She pushed him outward with her through the door<br />
And shut it after her. &#8220;Be kind,&#8221; she said.<br />
She took the market things from Warren&#8217;s arms<br />
And set them on the porch, then drew him down<br />
To sit beside her on the wooden steps.<br />
&#8216;When was I ever anything but kind to him?<br />
But I&#8217;ll not have the fellow back,&#8217; he said.<br />
&#8216;I told him so last haying, didn&#8217;t I?<br />
&#8220;If he left then,&#8221; I said, &#8220;that ended it.&#8221;<br />
What good is he? Who else will harbor him<br />
At his age for the little he can do?<br />
What help he is there&#8217;s no depending on.<br />
Off he goes always when I need him most.<br />
&#8216;He thinks he ought to earn a little pay,<br />
Enough at least to buy tobacco with,<br />
won&#8217;t have to beg and be beholden.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;All right,&#8221; I say &#8220;I can&#8217;t afford to pay<br />
Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Someone else can.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Then someone else will have to.<br />
I shouldn&#8217;t mind his bettering himself<br />
If that was what it was. You can be certain,<br />
When he begins like that, there&#8217;s someone at him<br />
Trying to coax him off with pocket-money, &#8211;<br />
In haying time, when any help is scarce.<br />
In winter he comes back to us. I&#8217;m done.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Shh I not so loud: he&#8217;ll hear you,&#8217; Mary said.</p>
<p>&#8216;I want him to: he&#8217;ll have to soon or late.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s worn out. He&#8217;s asleep beside the stove.<br />
When I came up from Rowe&#8217;s I found him here,<br />
Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep,<br />
A miserable sight, and frightening, too-<br />
You needn&#8217;t smile &#8212; I didn&#8217;t recognize him-<br />
I wasn&#8217;t looking for him- and he&#8217;s changed.<br />
Wait till you see.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Where did you say he&#8217;d been?</p>
<p>&#8216;He didn&#8217;t say. I dragged him to the house,<br />
And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke.<br />
I tried to make him talk about his travels.<br />
Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;What did he say? Did he say anything?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;But little.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Anything? Mary, confess<br />
He said he&#8217;d come to ditch the meadow for me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Warren!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;But did he? I just want to know.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Of course he did. What would you have him say?<br />
Surely you wouldn&#8217;t grudge the poor old man<br />
Some humble way to save his self-respect.<br />
He added, if you really care to know,<br />
He meant to dear the upper pasture, too.<br />
That sounds like something you have heard before?<br />
Warren, I wish you could have heard the way<br />
He jumbled everything. I stopped to look<br />
Two or three times &#8212; he made me feel so queer&#8211;<br />
To see if he was talking in his sleep.<br />
He ran on Harold Wilson &#8212; you remember -<br />
The boy you had in haying four years since.<br />
He&#8217;s finished school, and teaching in his college.<br />
Silas declares you&#8217;ll have to get him back.<br />
He says they two will make a team for work:<br />
Between them they will lay this farm as smooth!<br />
The way he mixed that in with other things.<br />
He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft<br />
On education &#8212; you know how they fought<br />
All through July under the blazing sun,<br />
Silas up on the cart to build the load,<br />
Harold along beside to pitch it on.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream.<br />
You wouldn&#8217;t think they would. How some things linger!<br />
Harold&#8217;s young college boy&#8217;s assurance piqued him.<br />
After so many years he still keeps finding<br />
Good arguments he sees he might have used.<br />
I sympathize. I know just how it feels<br />
To think of the right thing to say too late.<br />
Harold&#8217;s associated in his mind with Latin.<br />
He asked me what I thought of Harold&#8217;s saying<br />
He studied Latin like the violin<br />
Because he liked it &#8212; that an argument!<br />
He said he couldn&#8217;t make the boy believe<br />
He could find water with a hazel prong&#8211;<br />
Which showed how much good school had ever done<br />
him. He wanted to go over that. &#8216;But most of all<br />
He thinks if he could have another chance<br />
To teach him how to build a load of hay &#8211;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I know, that&#8217;s Silas&#8217; one accomplishment.<br />
He bundles every forkful in its place,<br />
And tags and numbers it for future reference,<br />
So he can find and easily dislodge it<br />
In the unloading. Silas does that well.<br />
He takes it out in bunches like big birds&#8217; nests.<br />
You never see him standing on the hay<br />
He&#8217;s trying to lift, straining to lift himself.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;He thinks if he could teach him that, he&#8217;d be<br />
Some good perhaps to someone in the world.<br />
He hates to see a boy the fool of books.<br />
Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk,<br />
And nothing to look backward to with pride,<br />
And nothing to look forward to with hope,<br />
So now and never any different.&#8217;</p>
<p>Part of a moon was filling down the west,<br />
Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills.<br />
Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw<br />
And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand<br />
Among the harp-like morning-glory strings,<br />
Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,<br />
As if she played unheard the tenderness<br />
That wrought on him beside her in the night.<br />
&#8216;Warren,&#8217; she said, &#8216;he has come home to die:<br />
You needn&#8217;t be afraid he&#8217;ll leave you this time.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Home,&#8217; he mocked gently.</p>
<p>&#8216;Yes, what else but home?<br />
It all depends on what you mean by home.<br />
Of course he&#8217;s nothing to us, any more<br />
then was the hound that came a stranger to us<br />
Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Home is the place where, when you have to go there,<br />
They have to take you in.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I should have called it<br />
Something you somehow haven&#8217;t to deserve.&#8217;</p>
<p>
Warren leaned out and took a step or two,<br />
Picked up a little stick, and brought it back<br />
And broke it in his hand and tossed it by.<br />
&#8216;Silas has better claim on&#8217; us, you think,<br />
Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles<br />
As the road winds would bring him to his door.<br />
Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day.<br />
Why didn&#8217;t he go there? His brother&#8217;s rich,<br />
A somebody- director in the bank.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;He never told us that.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;We know it though.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I think his brother ought to help, of course.<br />
I&#8217;ll see to that if there is need. He ought of right<br />
To take him in, and might be willing to&#8211;<br />
He may be better than appearances.<br />
But have some pity on Silas. Do you think<br />
If he&#8217;d had any pride in claiming kin<br />
Or anything he looked for from his brother,<br />
He&#8217;d keep so still about him all this time?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I wonder what&#8217;s between them.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I can tell you.<br />
Silas is what he is &#8212; we wouldn&#8217;t mind him&#8211;<br />
But just the kind that kinsfolk can&#8217;t abide.<br />
He never did a thing so very bad.<br />
He don&#8217;t know why he isn&#8217;t quite as good<br />
As anyone. He won&#8217;t be made ashamed<br />
To please his brother, worthless though he is.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t think Si ever hurt anyone.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay<br />
And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back.<br />
He wouldn&#8217;t let me put him on the lounge.<br />
You must go in and see what you can do.<br />
I made the bed up for him there to-night.<br />
You&#8217;ll be surprised at him &#8212; how much he&#8217;s broken.<br />
His working days are done; I&#8217;m sure of it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I&#8217;d not be in a hurry to say that.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I haven&#8217;t been. Go, look, see for yourself.<br />
But, Warren, please remember how it is:<br />
He&#8217; come to help you ditch the meadow.<br />
He has a plan, You mustn&#8217;t laugh at him.<br />
He may not speak of it, and then he may.<br />
I&#8217;ll sit and see if that small sailing cloud<br />
Will hit or miss the moon.&#8217;</p>
<p>
It hit the moon.</p>
<p>Then there were three there, making a dim row,<br />
The moon, the little silver cloud, and she.<br />
Warren returned&#8211; too soon, it seemed to her,<br />
Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited.</p>
<p>&#8216;Warren?&#8217; she questioned.</p>
<p>&#8216;Dead,&#8217; was all he answered.</p>
