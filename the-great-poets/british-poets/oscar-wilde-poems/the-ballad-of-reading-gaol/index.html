<p>Poem: The Ballad Of Reading Gaol</p>
<p>(In memoriam<br />
    C. T. W.<br />
    Sometime trooper of the Royal Horse Guards<br />
    obiit H.M. prison, Reading, Berkshire<br />
    July 7, 1896)</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>He did not wear his scarlet coat,<br />
    For blood and wine are red,<br />
    And blood and wine were on his hands<br />
    When they found him with the dead,<br />
    The poor dead woman whom he loved,<br />
    And murdered in her bed.</p>
<p>He walked amongst the Trial Men<br />
    In a suit of shabby grey;<br />
    A cricket cap was on his head,<br />
    And his step seemed light and gay;<br />
    But I never saw a man who looked<br />
    So wistfully at the day.</p>
<p>I never saw a man who looked<br />
    With such a wistful eye<br />
    Upon that little tent of blue<br />
    Which prisoners call the sky,<br />
    And at every drifting cloud that went<br />
    With sails of silver by.</p>
<p>I walked, with other souls in pain,<br />
    Within another ring,<br />
    And was wondering if the man had done<br />
    A great or little thing,<br />
    When a voice behind me whispered low,<br />
    &#8216;THAT FELLOW&#8217;S GOT TO SWING.&#8217;</p>
<p>Dear Christ! the very prison walls<br />
    Suddenly seemed to reel,<br />
    And the sky above my head became<br />
    Like a casque of scorching steel;<br />
    And, though I was a soul in pain,<br />
    My pain I could not feel.</p>
<p>I only knew what hunted thought<br />
    Quickened his step, and why<br />
    He looked upon the garish day<br />
    With such a wistful eye;<br />
    The man had killed the thing he loved,<br />
    And so he had to die.</p>
<p>
    Yet each man kills the thing he loves,<br />
    By each let this be heard,<br />
    Some do it with a bitter look,<br />
    Some with a flattering word,<br />
    The coward does it with a kiss,<br />
    The brave man with a sword!</p>
<p>Some kill their love when they are young,<br />
    And some when they are old;<br />
    Some strangle with the hands of Lust,<br />
    Some with the hands of Gold:<br />
    The kindest use a knife, because<br />
    The dead so soon grow cold.</p>
<p>Some love too little, some too long,<br />
    Some sell, and others buy;<br />
    Some do the deed with many tears,<br />
    And some without a sigh:<br />
    For each man kills the thing he loves,<br />
    Yet each man does not die.</p>
<p>He does not die a death of shame<br />
    On a day of dark disgrace,<br />
    Nor have a noose about his neck,<br />
    Nor a cloth upon his face,<br />
    Nor drop feet foremost through the floor<br />
    Into an empty space.</p>
<p>
    He does not sit with silent men<br />
    Who watch him night and day;<br />
    Who watch him when he tries to weep,<br />
    And when he tries to pray;<br />
    Who watch him lest himself should rob<br />
    The prison of its prey.</p>
<p>He does not wake at dawn to see<br />
    Dread figures throng his room,<br />
    The shivering Chaplain robed in white,<br />
    The Sheriff stern with gloom,<br />
    And the Governor all in shiny black,<br />
    With the yellow face of Doom.</p>
<p>He does not rise in piteous haste<br />
    To put on convict-clothes,<br />
    While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats,<br />
    and notes<br />
    Each new and nerve-twitched pose,<br />
    Fingering a watch whose little ticks<br />
    Are like horrible hammer-blows.</p>
<p>He does not know that sickening thirst<br />
    That sands one&#8217;s throat, before<br />
    The hangman with his gardener&#8217;s gloves<br />
    Slips through the padded door,<br />
    And binds one with three leathern thongs,<br />
    That the throat may thirst no more.</p>
<p>He does not bend his head to hear<br />
    The Burial Office read,<br />
    Nor, while the terror of his soul<br />
    Tells him he is not dead,<br />
    Cross his own coffin, as he moves<br />
    Into the hideous shed.</p>
<p>He does not stare upon the air<br />
    Through a little roof of glass:<br />
    He does not pray with lips of clay<br />
    For his agony to pass;<br />
    Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek<br />
    The kiss of Caiaphas.</p>
<p>
    II</p>
<p>
    Six weeks our guardsman walked the yard,<br />
    In the suit of shabby grey:<br />
    His cricket cap was on his head,<br />
    And his step seemed light and gay,<br />
    But I never saw a man who looked<br />
    So wistfully at the day.</p>
<p>I never saw a man who looked<br />
    With such a wistful eye<br />
    Upon that little tent of blue<br />
    Which prisoners call the sky,<br />
    And at every wandering cloud that trailed<br />
    Its ravelled fleeces by.</p>
<p>He did not wring his hands, as do<br />
    Those witless men who dare<br />
    To try to rear the changeling Hope<br />
    In the cave of black Despair:<br />
    He only looked upon the sun,<br />
    And drank the morning air.</p>
<p>He did not wring his hands nor weep,<br />
    Nor did he peek or pine,<br />
    But he drank the air as though it held<br />
    Some healthful anodyne;<br />
    With open mouth he drank the sun<br />
    As though it had been wine!</p>
<p>And I and all the souls in pain,<br />
    Who tramped the other ring,<br />
    Forgot if we ourselves had done<br />
    A great or little thing,<br />
    And watched with gaze of dull amaze<br />
    The man who had to swing.</p>
<p>And strange it was to see him pass<br />
    With a step so light and gay,<br />
    And strange it was to see him look<br />
    So wistfully at the day,<br />
    And strange it was to think that he<br />
    Had such a debt to pay.</p>
<p>
    For oak and elm have pleasant leaves<br />
    That in the springtime shoot:<br />
    But grim to see is the gallows-tree,<br />
    With its adder-bitten root,<br />
    And, green or dry, a man must die<br />
    Before it bears its fruit!</p>
<p>The loftiest place is that seat of grace<br />
    For which all worldlings try:<br />
    But who would stand in hempen band<br />
    Upon a scaffold high,<br />
    And through a murderer&#8217;s collar take<br />
    His last look at the sky?</p>
<p>It is sweet to dance to violins<br />
    When Love and Life are fair:<br />
    To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes<br />
    Is delicate and rare:<br />
    But it is not sweet with nimble feet<br />
    To dance upon the air!</p>
<p>So with curious eyes and sick surmise<br />
    We watched him day by day,<br />
    And wondered if each one of us<br />
    Would end the self-same way,<br />
    For none can tell to what red Hell<br />
    His sightless soul may stray.</p>
<p>At last the dead man walked no more<br />
    Amongst the Trial Men,<br />
    And I knew that he was standing up<br />
    In the black dock&#8217;s dreadful pen,<br />
    And that never would I see his face<br />
    In God&#8217;s sweet world again.</p>
<p>Like two doomed ships that pass in storm<br />
    We had crossed each other&#8217;s way:<br />
    But we made no sign, we said no word,<br />
    We had no word to say;<br />
    For we did not meet in the holy night,<br />
    But in the shameful day.</p>
<p>A prison wall was round us both,<br />
    Two outcast men we were:<br />
    The world had thrust us from its heart,<br />
    And God from out His care:<br />
    And the iron gin that waits for Sin<br />
    Had caught us in its snare.</p>
<p>
    III</p>
<p>
    In Debtors&#8217; Yard the stones are hard,<br />
    And the dripping wall is high,<br />
    So it was there he took the air<br />
    Beneath the leaden sky,<br />
    And by each side a Warder walked,<br />
    For fear the man might die.</p>
<p>Or else he sat with those who watched<br />
    His anguish night and day;<br />
    Who watched him when he rose to weep,<br />
    And when he crouched to pray;<br />
    Who watched him lest himself should rob<br />
    Their scaffold of its prey.</p>
<p>The Governor was strong upon<br />
    The Regulations Act:<br />
    The Doctor said that Death was but<br />
    A scientific fact:<br />
    And twice a day the Chaplain called,<br />
    And left a little tract.</p>
<p>And twice a day he smoked his pipe,<br />
    And drank his quart of beer:<br />
    His soul was resolute, and held<br />
    No hiding-place for fear;<br />
    He often said that he was glad<br />
    The hangman&#8217;s hands were near.</p>
<p>But why he said so strange a thing<br />
    No Warder dared to ask:<br />
    For he to whom a watcher&#8217;s doom<br />
    Is given as his task,<br />
    Must set a lock upon his lips,<br />
    And make his face a mask.</p>
<p>Or else he might be moved, and try<br />
    To comfort or console:<br />
    And what should Human Pity do<br />
    Pent up in Murderers&#8217; Hole?<br />
    What word of grace in such a place<br />
    Could help a brother&#8217;s soul?</p>
<p>
    With slouch and swing around the ring<br />
    We trod the Fools&#8217; Parade!<br />
    We did not care: we knew we were<br />
    The Devil&#8217;s Own Brigade:<br />
    And shaven head and feet of lead<br />
    Make a merry masquerade.</p>
<p>We tore the tarry rope to shreds<br />
    With blunt and bleeding nails;<br />
    We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,<br />
    And cleaned the shining rails:<br />
    And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,<br />
    And clattered with the pails.</p>
<p>We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,<br />
    We turned the dusty drill:<br />
    We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,<br />
    And sweated on the mill:<br />
    But in the heart of every man<br />
    Terror was lying still.</p>
<p>So still it lay that every day<br />
    Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:<br />
    And we forgot the bitter lot<br />
    That waits for fool and knave,<br />
    Till once, as we tramped in from work,<br />
    We passed an open grave.</p>
<p>With yawning mouth the yellow hole<br />
    Gaped for a living thing;<br />
    The very mud cried out for blood<br />
    To the thirsty asphalte ring:<br />
    And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair<br />
    Some prisoner had to swing.</p>
<p>Right in we went, with soul intent<br />
    On Death and Dread and Doom:<br />
    The hangman, with his little bag,<br />
    Went shuffling through the gloom:<br />
    And each man trembled as he crept<br />
    Into his numbered tomb.</p>
<p>
    That night the empty corridors<br />
    Were full of forms of Fear,<br />
    And up and down the iron town<br />
    Stole feet we could not hear,<br />
    And through the bars that hide the stars<br />
    White faces seemed to peer.</p>
<p>He lay as one who lies and dreams<br />
    In a pleasant meadow-land,<br />
    The watchers watched him as he slept,<br />
    And could not understand<br />
    How one could sleep so sweet a sleep<br />
    With a hangman close at hand.</p>
<p>But there is no sleep when men must weep<br />
    Who never yet have wept:<br />
    So we &#8211; the fool, the fraud, the knave -<br />
    That endless vigil kept,<br />
    And through each brain on hands of pain<br />
    Another&#8217;s terror crept.</p>
<p>Alas! it is a fearful thing<br />
    To feel another&#8217;s guilt!<br />
    For, right within, the sword of Sin<br />
    Pierced to its poisoned hilt,<br />
    And as molten lead were the tears we shed<br />
    For the blood we had not spilt.</p>
<p>The Warders with their shoes of felt<br />
    Crept by each padlocked door,<br />
    And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,<br />
    Grey figures on the floor,<br />
    And wondered why men knelt to pray<br />
    Who never prayed before.</p>
<p>All through the night we knelt and prayed,<br />
    Mad mourners of a corse!<br />
    The troubled plumes of midnight were<br />
    The plumes upon a hearse:<br />
    And bitter wine upon a sponge<br />
    Was the savour of Remorse.</p>
<p>
    The grey cock crew, the red cock crew,<br />
    But never came the day:<br />
    And crooked shapes of Terror crouched,<br />
    In the corners where we lay:<br />
    And each evil sprite that walks by night<br />
    Before us seemed to play.</p>
<p>They glided past, they glided fast,<br />
    Like travellers through a mist:<br />
    They mocked the moon in a rigadoon<br />
    Of delicate turn and twist,<br />
    And with formal pace and loathsome grace<br />
    The phantoms kept their tryst.</p>
<p>With mop and mow, we saw them go,<br />
    Slim shadows hand in hand:<br />
    About, about, in ghostly rout<br />
    They trod a saraband:<br />
    And the damned grotesques made arabesques,<br />
    Like the wind upon the sand!</p>
<p>With the pirouettes of marionettes,<br />
    They tripped on pointed tread:<br />
    But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,<br />
    As their grisly masque they led,<br />
    And loud they sang, and long they sang,<br />
    For they sang to wake the dead.</p>
<p>&#8216;Oho!&#8217; they cried, &#8216;The world is wide,<br />
    But fettered limbs go lame!<br />
    And once, or twice, to throw the dice<br />
    Is a gentlemanly game,<br />
    But he does not win who plays with Sin<br />
    In the secret House of Shame.&#8217;</p>
<p>No things of air these antics were,<br />
    That frolicked with such glee:<br />
    To men whose lives were held in gyves,<br />
    And whose feet might not go free,<br />
    Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,<br />
    Most terrible to see.</p>
<p>Around, around, they waltzed and wound;<br />
    Some wheeled in smirking pairs;<br />
    With the mincing step of a demirep<br />
    Some sidled up the stairs:<br />
    And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,<br />
    Each helped us at our prayers.</p>
<p>The morning wind began to moan,<br />
    But still the night went on:<br />
    Through its giant loom the web of gloom<br />
    Crept till each thread was spun:<br />
    And, as we prayed, we grew afraid<br />
    Of the Justice of the Sun.</p>
<p>The moaning wind went wandering round<br />
    The weeping prison-wall:<br />
    Till like a wheel of turning steel<br />
    We felt the minutes crawl:<br />
    O moaning wind! what had we done<br />
    To have such a seneschal?</p>
<p>At last I saw the shadowed bars,<br />
    Like a lattice wrought in lead,<br />
    Move right across the whitewashed wall<br />
    That faced my three-plank bed,<br />
    And I knew that somewhere in the world<br />
    God&#8217;s dreadful dawn was red.</p>
<p>At six o&#8217;clock we cleaned our cells,<br />
    At seven all was still,<br />
    But the sough and swing of a mighty wing<br />
    The prison seemed to fill,<br />
    For the Lord of Death with icy breath<br />
    Had entered in to kill.</p>
<p>He did not pass in purple pomp,<br />
    Nor ride a moon-white steed.<br />
    Three yards of cord and a sliding board<br />
    Are all the gallows&#8217; need:<br />
    So with rope of shame the Herald came<br />
    To do the secret deed.</p>
<p>We were as men who through a fen<br />
    Of filthy darkness grope:<br />
    We did not dare to breathe a prayer,<br />
    Or to give our anguish scope:<br />
    Something was dead in each of us,<br />
    And what was dead was Hope.</p>
<p>For Man&#8217;s grim Justice goes its way,<br />
    And will not swerve aside:<br />
    It slays the weak, it slays the strong,<br />
    It has a deadly stride:<br />
    With iron heel it slays the strong,<br />
    The monstrous parricide!</p>
<p>We waited for the stroke of eight:<br />
    Each tongue was thick with thirst:<br />
    For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate<br />
    That makes a man accursed,<br />
    And Fate will use a running noose<br />
    For the best man and the worst.</p>
<p>We had no other thing to do,<br />
    Save to wait for the sign to come:<br />
    So, like things of stone in a valley lone,<br />
    Quiet we sat and dumb:<br />
    But each man&#8217;s heart beat thick and quick,<br />
    Like a madman on a drum!</p>
<p>With sudden shock the prison-clock<br />
    Smote on the shivering air,<br />
    And from all the gaol rose up a wail<br />
    Of impotent despair,<br />
    Like the sound that frightened marshes hear<br />
    From some leper in his lair.</p>
<p>And as one sees most fearful things<br />
    In the crystal of a dream,<br />
    We saw the greasy hempen rope<br />
    Hooked to the blackened beam,<br />
    And heard the prayer the hangman&#8217;s snare<br />
    Strangled into a scream.</p>
<p>And all the woe that moved him so<br />
    That he gave that bitter cry,<br />
    And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,<br />
    None knew so well as I:<br />
    For he who lives more lives than one<br />
    More deaths than one must die.</p>
<p>
    IV</p>
<p>
    There is no chapel on the day<br />
    On which they hang a man:<br />
    The Chaplain&#8217;s heart is far too sick,<br />
    Or his face is far too wan,<br />
    Or there is that written in his eyes<br />
    Which none should look upon.</p>
<p>So they kept us close till nigh on noon,<br />
    And then they rang the bell,<br />
    And the Warders with their jingling keys<br />
    Opened each listening cell,<br />
    And down the iron stair we tramped,<br />
    Each from his separate Hell.</p>
<p>Out into God&#8217;s sweet air we went,<br />
    But not in wonted way,<br />
    For this man&#8217;s face was white with fear,<br />
    And that man&#8217;s face was grey,<br />
    And I never saw sad men who looked<br />
    So wistfully at the day.</p>
<p>I never saw sad men who looked<br />
    With such a wistful eye<br />
    Upon that little tent of blue<br />
    We prisoners called the sky,<br />
    And at every careless cloud that passed<br />
    In happy freedom by.</p>
<p>But there were those amongst us all<br />
    Who walked with downcast head,<br />
    And knew that, had each got his due,<br />
    They should have died instead:<br />
    He had but killed a thing that lived,<br />
    Whilst they had killed the dead.</p>
<p>For he who sins a second time<br />
    Wakes a dead soul to pain,<br />
    And draws it from its spotted shroud,<br />
    And makes it bleed again,<br />
    And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,<br />
    And makes it bleed in vain!</p>
<p>
    Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb<br />
    With crooked arrows starred,<br />
    Silently we went round and round<br />
    The slippery asphalte yard;<br />
    Silently we went round and round,<br />
    And no man spoke a word.</p>
<p>Silently we went round and round,<br />
    And through each hollow mind<br />
    The Memory of dreadful things<br />
    Rushed like a dreadful wind,<br />
    And Horror stalked before each man,<br />
    And Terror crept behind.</p>
<p>
    The Warders strutted up and down,<br />
    And kept their herd of brutes,<br />
    Their uniforms were spick and span,<br />
    And they wore their Sunday suits,<br />
    But we knew the work they had been at,<br />
    By the quicklime on their boots.</p>
<p>For where a grave had opened wide,<br />
    There was no grave at all:<br />
    Only a stretch of mud and sand<br />
    By the hideous prison-wall,<br />
    And a little heap of burning lime,<br />
    That the man should have his pall.</p>
<p>For he has a pall, this wretched man,<br />
    Such as few men can claim:<br />
    Deep down below a prison-yard,<br />
    Naked for greater shame,<br />
    He lies, with fetters on each foot,<br />
    Wrapt in a sheet of flame!</p>
<p>And all the while the burning lime<br />
    Eats flesh and bone away,<br />
    It eats the brittle bone by night,<br />
    And the soft flesh by day,<br />
    It eats the flesh and bone by turns,<br />
    But it eats the heart alway.</p>
<p>
    For three long years they will not sow<br />
    Or root or seedling there:<br />
    For three long years the unblessed spot<br />
    Will sterile be and bare,<br />
    And look upon the wondering sky<br />
    With unreproachful stare.</p>
<p>They think a murderer&#8217;s heart would taint<br />
    Each simple seed they sow.<br />
    It is not true! God&#8217;s kindly earth<br />
    Is kindlier than men know,<br />
    And the red rose would but blow more red,<br />
    The white rose whiter blow.</p>
<p>Out of his mouth a red, red rose!<br />
    Out of his heart a white!<br />
    For who can say by what strange way,<br />
    Christ brings His will to light,<br />
    Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore<br />
    Bloomed in the great Pope&#8217;s sight?</p>
<p>But neither milk-white rose nor red<br />
    May bloom in prison-air;<br />
    The shard, the pebble, and the flint,<br />
    Are what they give us there:<br />
    For flowers have been known to heal<br />
    A common man&#8217;s despair.</p>
<p>So never will wine-red rose or white,<br />
    Petal by petal, fall<br />
    On that stretch of mud and sand that lies<br />
    By the hideous prison-wall,<br />
    To tell the men who tramp the yard<br />
    That God&#8217;s Son died for all.</p>
<p>
    Yet though the hideous prison-wall<br />
    Still hems him round and round,<br />
    And a spirit may not walk by night<br />
    That is with fetters bound,<br />
    And a spirit may but weep that lies<br />
    In such unholy ground,</p>
<p>He is at peace &#8211; this wretched man -<br />
    At peace, or will be soon:<br />
    There is no thing to make him mad,<br />
    Nor does Terror walk at noon,<br />
    For the lampless Earth in which he lies<br />
    Has neither Sun nor Moon.</p>
<p>They hanged him as a beast is hanged:<br />
    They did not even toll<br />
    A requiem that might have brought<br />
    Rest to his startled soul,<br />
    But hurriedly they took him out,<br />
    And hid him in a hole.</p>
<p>They stripped him of his canvas clothes,<br />
    And gave him to the flies:<br />
    They mocked the swollen purple throat,<br />
    And the stark and staring eyes:<br />
    And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud<br />
    In which their convict lies.</p>
<p>The Chaplain would not kneel to pray<br />
    By his dishonoured grave:<br />
    Nor mark it with that blessed Cross<br />
    That Christ for sinners gave,<br />
    Because the man was one of those<br />
    Whom Christ came down to save.</p>
<p>Yet all is well; he has but passed<br />
    To Life&#8217;s appointed bourne:<br />
    And alien tears will fill for him<br />
    Pity&#8217;s long-broken urn,<br />
    For his mourners will be outcast men,<br />
    And outcasts always mourn</p>
<p>
    V</p>
<p>
    I know not whether Laws be right,<br />
    Or whether Laws be wrong;<br />
    All that we know who lie in gaol<br />
    Is that the wall is strong;<br />
    And that each day is like a year,<br />
    A year whose days are long.</p>
<p>But this I know, that every Law<br />
    That men have made for Man,<br />
    Since first Man took his brother&#8217;s life,<br />
    And the sad world began,<br />
    But straws the wheat and saves the chaff<br />
    With a most evil fan.</p>
<p>This too I know &#8211; and wise it were<br />
    If each could know the same -<br />
    That every prison that men build<br />
    Is built with bricks of shame,<br />
    And bound with bars lest Christ should see<br />
    How men their brothers maim.</p>
<p>With bars they blur the gracious moon,<br />
    And blind the goodly sun:<br />
    And they do well to hide their Hell,<br />
    For in it things are done<br />
    That Son of God nor son of Man<br />
    Ever should look upon!</p>
<p>
    The vilest deeds like poison weeds,<br />
    Bloom well in prison-air;<br />
    It is only what is good in Man<br />
    That wastes and withers there:<br />
    Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,<br />
    And the Warder is Despair.</p>
<p>For they starve the little frightened child<br />
    Till it weeps both night and day:<br />
    And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,<br />
    And gibe the old and grey,<br />
    And some grow mad, and all grow bad,<br />
    And none a word may say.</p>
<p>Each narrow cell in which we dwell<br />
    Is a foul and dark latrine,<br />
    And the fetid breath of living Death<br />
    Chokes up each grated screen,<br />
    And all, but Lust, is turned to dust<br />
    In Humanity&#8217;s machine.</p>
<p>The brackish water that we drink<br />
    Creeps with a loathsome slime,<br />
    And the bitter bread they weigh in scales<br />
    Is full of chalk and lime,<br />
    And Sleep will not lie down, but walks<br />
    Wild-eyed, and cries to Time.</p>
<p>
    But though lean Hunger and green Thirst<br />
    Like asp with adder fight,<br />
    We have little care of prison fare,<br />
    For what chills and kills outright<br />
    Is that every stone one lifts by day<br />
    Becomes one&#8217;s heart by night.</p>
<p>With midnight always in one&#8217;s heart,<br />
    And twilight in one&#8217;s cell,<br />
    We turn the crank, or tear the rope,<br />
    Each in his separate Hell,<br />
    And the silence is more awful far<br />
    Than the sound of a brazen bell.</p>
<p>And never a human voice comes near<br />
    To speak a gentle word:<br />
    And the eye that watches through the door<br />
    Is pitiless and hard:<br />
    And by all forgot, we rot and rot,<br />
    With soul and body marred.</p>
<p>And thus we rust Life&#8217;s iron chain<br />
    Degraded and alone:<br />
    And some men curse, and some men weep,<br />
    And some men make no moan:<br />
    But God&#8217;s eternal Laws are kind<br />
    And break the heart of stone.</p>
<p>
    And every human heart that breaks,<br />
    In prison-cell or yard,<br />
    Is as that broken box that gave<br />
    Its treasure to the Lord,<br />
    And filled the unclean leper&#8217;s house<br />
    With the scent of costliest nard.</p>
<p>Ah! happy they whose hearts can break<br />
    And peace of pardon win!<br />
    How else may man make straight his plan<br />
    And cleanse his soul from Sin?<br />
    How else but through a broken heart<br />
    May Lord Christ enter in?</p>
<p>
    And he of the swollen purple throat,<br />
    And the stark and staring eyes,<br />
    Waits for the holy hands that took<br />
    The Thief to Paradise;<br />
    And a broken and a contrite heart<br />
    The Lord will not despise.</p>
<p>The man in red who reads the Law<br />
    Gave him three weeks of life,<br />
    Three little weeks in which to heal<br />
    His soul of his soul&#8217;s strife,<br />
    And cleanse from every blot of blood<br />
    The hand that held the knife.</p>
<p>And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,<br />
    The hand that held the steel:<br />
    For only blood can wipe out blood,<br />
    And only tears can heal:<br />
    And the crimson stain that was of Cain<br />
    Became Christ&#8217;s snow-white seal.</p>
<p>
    VI</p>
<p>
    In Reading gaol by Reading town<br />
    There is a pit of shame,<br />
    And in it lies a wretched man<br />
    Eaten by teeth of flame,<br />
    In a burning winding-sheet he lies,<br />
    And his grave has got no name.</p>
<p>And there, till Christ call forth the dead,<br />
    In silence let him lie:<br />
    No need to waste the foolish tear,<br />
    Or heave the windy sigh:<br />
    The man had killed the thing he loved,<br />
    And so he had to die.</p>
<p>And all men kill the thing they love,<br />
    By all let this be heard,<br />
    Some do it with a bitter look,<br />
    Some with a flattering word,<br />
    The coward does it with a kiss,<br />
    The brave man with a sword!</p>
