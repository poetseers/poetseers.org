<h1 class="documentFirstHeading">Morte D&#8217;Arthur</h1>
<p>
So all day long the noise of battle rolled<br />
Among the mountains by the winter sea;<br />
Until King Arthur&#8217;s table, man by man,<br />
Had fallen in Lyonnesse about their Lord,<br />
King Arthur: then, because his wound was deep,<br />
The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,<br />
Sir Bedivere, the last of all his knights,<br />
And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,<br />
A broken chancel with a broken cross,<br />
That stood on a dark strait of barren land.<br />
On one side lay the Ocean, and on one<br />
Lay a great water, and the moon was full.</p>
<p>Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:<br />
&#8220;The sequel of today unsolders all<br />
The goodliest fellowship of famous knights<br />
Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep<br />
They sleep -the men I loved. I think that we<br />
Shall never more, at any future time,<br />
Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,<br />
Walking about the gardens and the halls<br />
Of Camelot, as in the days that were.<br />
I perish by this people which I made, &#8211; <br />
Though Merlin sware that I should come again<br />
To rule once more -but let what will be, be,<br />
I am so deeply smitten through the helm<br />
That without help I cannot last till morn.<br />
Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,<br />
Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how<br />
In those old days, one summer noon, and arm<br />
Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,<br />
Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,<br />
Holding the sword -and how I rowed across<br />
And took it, and have worn it, like a king:<br />
And, wheresoever I am sung or told<br />
In aftertime, this also shall be known:<br />
But now delay not: take Excalibur,<br />
And fling him far into the middle mere:<br />
Watch what thou seest, and lightly bring me word.&#8221;</p>
<p>To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:<br />
&#8220;It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,<br />
Aidless, alone, and smitten through the helm.<br />
A little thing may harm a wounded man.<br />
Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,<br />
Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word.&#8221;</p>
<p>So saying, from the ruined shrine he stepped<br />
And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,<br />
Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,<br />
Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang<br />
Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down<br />
By zig-zag paths, and juts of pointed rock,<br />
Came on the shining levels of the lake.</p>
<p>There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,<br />
And o&#8217;er him, drawing it, the winter moon,<br />
Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth<br />
And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:<br />
For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,<br />
Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work<br />
Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long<br />
That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood,<br />
This way and that dividing the swift mind,<br />
In act to throw: but at the last it seemed<br />
Better to leave Excalibur concealed<br />
There in the many-knotted waterflags,<br />
That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.<br />
So strode he back slow to the wounded King.</p>
<p>Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:<br />
&#8220;Hast thou performed my mission which I gave?<br />
What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?&#8221;</p>
<p>And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:<br />
&#8220;I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,<br />
And the wild water lapping on the crag.&#8221;</p>
<p>To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:<br />
&#8220;Thou hast betrayed thy nature and thy name,<br />
Not rendering true answer, as beseemed<br />
Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight:<br />
For surer sign had followed, either hand,<br />
Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.<br />
This is a shameful thing for men to lie.<br />
Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again<br />
As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing<br />
I bad thee, watch, and lightly bring me word.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then went Sir Bedivere the second time<br />
Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,<br />
Counting the dewy pebbles, fixed in thought;<br />
But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,<br />
How curiously and strangely chased, he smote<br />
His palms together, and he cried aloud,</p>
<p>&#8220;And if indeed I cast the brand away,<br />
Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,<br />
Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,<br />
Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.<br />
What good should follow this, if this were done?<br />
What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey,<br />
Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.<br />
Were it well to obey then, if a king demand<br />
An act unprofitable, against himself?<br />
The King is sick, and knows not what he does.<br />
What record, or what relic of my lord<br />
Should be to aftertime, but empty breath<br />
And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept,<br />
Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,<br />
Some one might show it at a joust of arms,<br />
Saying, `King Arthur&#8217;s sword, Excalibur,<br />
Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.<br />
Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps<br />
Upon the hidden bases of the hills.&#8217;<br />
So might some old man speak in the aftertime<br />
To all the people, winning reverence.<br />
But now much honour and much fame were lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,<br />
And hid Excalibur the second time,<br />
And so strode back slow to the wounded King.</p>
<p>Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:<br />
&#8220;What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?&#8221;</p>
<p>And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:<br />
&#8220;I heard the water lapping on the crag,<br />
And the long ripple washing in the reeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:<br />
&#8220;Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,<br />
Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!<br />
Authority forgets a dying king,<br />
Laid widowed of the power in his eye<br />
That bowed the will. I see thee what thou art,<br />
For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,<br />
In whom should meet the offices of all,<br />
Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;<br />
Either from lust of gold, or like a girl<br />
Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.<br />
Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,<br />
And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:<br />
But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,<br />
I will arise and slay thee with my hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,<br />
And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged<br />
Among the bulrush-beds, and clutched the sword,<br />
And strongly wheeled and threw it. The great brand<br />
Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,<br />
And flashing round and round, and whirled in an arch,<br />
Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,<br />
Seen where the moving isles of winter shock<br />
By night, with noises of the northern sea.<br />
So flashed and fell the brand Excalibur:<br />
But ere he dipped the surface, rose and arm<br />
Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,<br />
And caught him by the hilt, and brandished him<br />
Three times, and drew him under in the mere.<br />
And lightly went the other to the King.</p>
<p>Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:<br />
&#8220;Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.<br />
Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?&#8221;</p>
<p>And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:<br />
&#8220;Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems<br />
Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,<br />
Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,<br />
Not though I live three lives of mortal men,<br />
So great a miracle as yonder hilt.<br />
Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;<br />
But when I looked again, behold an arm,<br />
Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,<br />
That caught him by the hilt, and brandished him<br />
Three times, and drew him under in the mere.&#8221;</p>
<p>And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:<br />
&#8220;My end draws nigh; &#8217;tis time that I were gone.<br />
Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,<br />
And bear me to the margin; yet I fear<br />
My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die.&#8221;</p>
<p>So saying, from the pavement he half rose,<br />
Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,<br />
And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes<br />
As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere<br />
Remorsefully regarded through his tears,<br />
And would have spoken, but he found not words,<br />
Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,<br />
O&#8217;er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,<br />
And rising bore him through the place of tombs.</p>
<p>But, as he walked, King Arthur panted hard,<br />
Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed<br />
When all the house is mute. So sighed the King,<br />
Muttering and murmuring at his ear, &#8220;Quick, quick!<br />
I fear it is too late, and I shall die.&#8221;<br />
But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,<br />
Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walked,<br />
Larger than human on the frozen hills.<br />
He heard the deep behind him, and a cry<br />
Before. His own thought drove him, like a goad.<br />
Dry clashed his harness in the icy caves<br />
And barren chasms, and all to left and right<br />
The bare black cliff clanged round him, as he based<br />
His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang<br />
Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels &#8211; <br />
And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,<br />
And the long glories of the winter moon.</p>
<p>Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge,<br />
Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,<br />
Beneath them; and descending they were ware<br />
That all the decks were dense with stately forms<br />
Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream -by these<br />
Three Queens with crowns of gold -and from them rose<br />
A cry that shivered to the tingling stars,<br />
And, as it were one voice, an agony<br />
Of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills<br />
All night in a waste land, where no one comes,<br />
Or hath come, since the making of the world.</p>
<p>Then murmured Arthur, &#8220;Place me in the barge,&#8221;<br />
And to the barge they came. There those three Queens<br />
Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept.<br />
But she, that rose the tallest of them all<br />
And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,<br />
And loosed the shattered casque, and chafed his hands,<br />
And called him by his name, complaining loud,<br />
And dropping bitter tears against his brow<br />
Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white<br />
And colourless, and like the withered moon<br />
Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;<br />
And all his greaves and cuisses dashed with drops<br />
Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls &#8211; <br />
That made his forehead like a rising sun<br />
High from the dais-throne -were parched with dust;<br />
Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,<br />
Mixed with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.<br />
So like a shattered column lay the King;<br />
Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,<br />
From spur to plume a star of tournament,<br />
Shot through the lists at Camelot, and charged<br />
Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.</p>
<p>Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere,<br />
&#8220;Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?<br />
Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?<br />
For now I see the true old times are dead,<br />
When every morning brought a noble chance,<br />
And every chance brought out a noble knight.<br />
Such times have been not since the light that led<br />
The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.<br />
But now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved<br />
Which was an image of the mighty world;<br />
And I, the last, go forth companionless,<br />
And the days darken round me, and the years,<br />
Among new men, strange faces, other minds.&#8221;</p>
<p>And slowly answered Arthur from the barge:<br />
&#8220;The old order changeth, yielding place to new,<br />
And God fulfils Himself in many ways,<br />
Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.<br />
Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me?<br />
I have lived my life, and that which I have done<br />
May He within Himself make pure! but thou,<br />
If thou shouldst never see my face again,<br />
Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer<br />
Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice<br />
Rise like a fountain for me night and day.<br />
For what are men better than sheep or goats<br />
That nourish a blind life within the brain,<br />
If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer<br />
Both for themselves and those who call them friend?<br />
For so the whole round earth is every way<br />
Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.<br />
But now farewell. I am going a long way<br />
With these thou seest -if indeed I go &#8211; <br />
(For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)<br />
To the island-valley of Avilion;<br />
Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,<br />
Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies<br />
Deep-meadowed, happy, fair with orchard-lawns<br />
And bowery hollows crowned with summer sea,<br />
Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.&#8221;</p>
<p>So said he, and the barge with oar and sail<br />
Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan<br />
That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,<br />
Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood<br />
With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere<br />
Revolving many memories, till the hull<br />
Looked one black dot against the verge of dawn,<br />
And on the mere the wailing died away.</p>
