				<p>I.</p>
<p>I held it truth, with him who sings<br />
To one clear harp in divers tones, <br />
That men may rise on stepping-stones <br />
Of their dead selves to higher things.</p>
<p>But who shall so forecast the years<br />
And find in loss a gain to match? <br />
Or reach a hand thro&#8217; time to catch <br />
The far-off interest of tears?</p>
<p>Let Love clasp Grief lest both be drown&#8217;d,<br />
Let darkness keep her raven gloss: <br />
Ah, sweeter to be drunk with loss, <br />
To dance with death, to beat the ground,</p>
<p>Than that the victor Hours should scorn<br />
The long result of love, and boast, <br />
&#8216;Behold the man that loved and lost, <br />
But all he was is overworn.&#8217;</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Old Yew, which graspest at the stones<br />
That name the under-lying dead, <br />
Thy fibres net the dreamless head, <br />
Thy roots are wrapt about the bones.</p>
<p>The seasons bring the flower again,<br />
And bring the firstling to the flock; <br />
And in the dusk of thee, the clock <br />
Beats out the little lives of men.</p>
<p>O not for thee the glow, the bloom,<br />
Who changest not in any gale, <br />
Nor branding summer suns avail <br />
To touch thy thousand years of gloom:</p>
<p>And gazing on thee, sullen tree,<br />
Sick for thy stubborn hardihood, <br />
I seem to fail from out my blood <br />
And grow incorporate into thee.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>O Sorrow, cruel fellowship,<br />
O Priestess in the vaults of Death, <br />
O sweet and bitter in a breath, <br />
What whispers from thy lying lip?</p>
<p>&#8216;The stars,&#8217; she whispers, &#8216;blindly run;<br />
A web is wov&#8217;n across the sky; <br />
From out waste places comes a cry, <br />
And murmurs from the dying sun:</p>
<p>&#8216;And all the phantom, Nature, stands &#8211; <br />
With all the music in her tone, <br />
A hollow echo of my own, &#8211; <br />
A hollow form with empty hands.&#8217;</p>
<p>And shall I take a thing so blind,<br />
Embrace her as my natural good; <br />
Or crush her, like a vice of blood, <br />
Upon the threshold of the mind?</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>To Sleep I give my powers away;<br />
My will is bondsman to the dark; <br />
I sit within a helmless bark, <br />
And with my heart I muse and say:</p>
<p>O heart, how fares it with thee now,<br />
That thou should&#8217;st fail from thy desire, <br />
Who scarcely darest to inquire, <br />
&#8216;What is it makes me beat so low?&#8217;</p>
<p>Something it is which thou hast lost,<br />
Some pleasure from thine early years. <br />
Break, thou deep vase of chilling tears, <br />
That grief hath shaken into frost!</p>
<p>Such clouds of nameless trouble cross<br />
All night below the darken&#8217;d eyes; <br />
With morning wakes the will, and cries, <br />
&#8216;Thou shalt not be the fool of loss.&#8217;</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>I sometimes hold it half a sin<br />
To put in words the grief I feel; <br />
For words, like Nature, half reveal <br />
And half conceal the Soul within.</p>
<p>But, for the unquiet heart and brain,<br />
A use in measured language lies; <br />
The sad mechanic exercise, <br />
Like dull narcotics, numbing pain.</p>
<p>In words, like weeds, I&#8217;ll wrap me o&#8217;er,<br />
Like coarsest clothes against the cold: <br />
But that large grief which these enfold <br />
Is given in outline and no more.</p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>One writes, that &#8216;Other friends remain,&#8217;<br />
That &#8216;Loss is common to the race&#8217; &#8211; <br />
And common is the commonplace, <br />
And vacant chaff well meant for grain.</p>
<p>That loss is common would not make<br />
My own less bitter, rather more: <br />
Too common! Never morning wore <br />
To evening, but some heart did break.</p>
<p>O father, wheresoe&#8217;er thou be,<br />
Who pledgest now thy gallant son; <br />
A shot, ere half thy draught be done, <br />
Hath still&#8217;d the life that beat from thee.</p>
<p>O mother, praying God will save<br />
Thy sailor, &#8211; while thy head is bow&#8217;d, <br />
His heavy-shotted hammock-shroud <br />
Drops in his vast and wandering grave.</p>
<p>Ye know no more than I who wrought<br />
At that last hour to please him well; <br />
Who mused on all I had to tell, <br />
And something written, something thought;</p>
<p>Expecting still his advent home;<br />
And ever met him on his way <br />
With wishes, thinking, &#8216;here to-day,&#8217; <br />
Or &#8216;here to-morrow will he come.&#8217;</p>
<p>O somewhere, meek, unconscious dove,<br />
That sittest ranging golden hair; <br />
And glad to find thyself so fair, <br />
Poor child, that waitest for thy love!</p>
<p>For now her father&#8217;s chimney glows<br />
In expectation of a guest; <br />
And thinking &#8216;this will please him best,&#8217; <br />
She takes a riband or a rose;</p>
<p>For he will see them on to-night;<br />
And with the thought her colour burns; <br />
And, having left the glass, she turns <br />
Once more to set a ringlet right;</p>
<p>And, even when she turn&#8217;d, the curse<br />
Had fallen, and her future Lord <br />
Was drown&#8217;d in passing thro&#8217; the ford, <br />
Or kill&#8217;d in falling from his horse.</p>
<p>O what to her shall be the end?<br />
And what to me remains of good? <br />
To her, perpetual maidenhood, <br />
And unto me no second friend.</p>
<p>VII.</p>
<p>Dark house, by which once more I stand<br />
Here in the long unlovely street, <br />
Doors, where my heart was used to beat <br />
So quickly, waiting for a hand,</p>
<p>A hand that can be clasp&#8217;d no more &#8211; <br />
Behold me, for I cannot sleep, <br />
And like a guilty thing I creep <br />
At earliest morning to the door.</p>
<p>He is not here; but far away<br />
The noise of life begins again, <br />
And ghastly thro&#8217; the drizzling rain <br />
On the bald street breaks the blank day.</p>
<p>VIII.</p>
<p>A happy lover who has come<br />
To look on her that loves him well, <br />
Who &#8216;lights and rings the gateway bell, <br />
And learns her gone and far from home;</p>
<p>He saddens, all the magic light<br />
Dies off at once from bower and hall, <br />
And all the place is dark, and all <br />
The chambers emptied of delight:</p>
<p>So find I every pleasant spot<br />
In which we two were wont to meet, <br />
The field, the chamber and the street, <br />
For all is dark where thou art not.</p>
<p>Yet as that other, wandering there<br />
In those deserted walks, may find <br />
A flower beat with rain and wind, <br />
Which once she foster&#8217;d up with care;</p>
<p>So seems it in my deep regret,<br />
O my forsaken heart, with thee <br />
And this poor flower of poesy <br />
Which little cared for fades not yet.</p>
<p>But since it pleased a vanish&#8217;d eye,<br />
I go to plant it on his tomb, <br />
That if it can it there may bloom, <br />
Or dying, there at least may die.</p>
<p>IX.</p>
<p>Fair ship, that from the Italian shore<br />
Sailest the placid ocean-plains <br />
With my lost Arthur&#8217;s loved remains, <br />
Spread thy full wings, and waft him o&#8217;er.</p>
<p>So draw him home to those that mourn<br />
In vain; a favourable speed <br />
Ruffle thy mirror&#8217;d mast, and lead <br />
Thro&#8217; prosperous floods his holy urn.</p>
<p>All night no ruder air perplex<br />
Thy sliding keel, till Phosphor, bright <br />
As our pure love, thro&#8217; early light <br />
Shall glimmer on the dewy decks.</p>
<p>Sphere all your lights around, above;<br />
Sleep, gentle heavens, before the prow; <br />
Sleep, gentle winds, as he sleeps now, <br />
My friend, the brother of my love;</p>
<p>My Arthur, whom I shall not see<br />
Till all my widow&#8217;d race be run; <br />
Dear as the mother to the son, <br />
More than my brothers are to me.</p>
<p>X.</p>
<p>I hear the noise about thy keel;<br />
I hear the bell struck in the night: <br />
I see the cabin-window bright; <br />
I see the sailor at the wheel.</p>
<p>Thou bring&#8217;st the sailor to his wife,<br />
And travell&#8217;d men from foreign lands; <br />
And letters unto trembling hands; <br />
And, thy dark freight, a vanish&#8217;d life.</p>
<p>So bring him: we have idle dreams:<br />
This look of quiet flatters thus <br />
Our home-bred fancies: O to us, <br />
The fools of habit, sweeter seems</p>
<p>To rest beneath the clover sod,<br />
That takes the sunshine and the rains, <br />
Or where the kneeling hamlet drains <br />
The chalice of the grapes of God;</p>
<p>Than if with thee the roaring wells<br />
Should gulf him fathom-deep in brine; <br />
And hands so often clasp&#8217;d in mine, <br />
Should toss with tangle and with shells.</p>
<p>XI.</p>
<p>Calm is the morn without a sound,<br />
Calm as to suit a calmer grief, <br />
And only thro&#8217; the faded leaf <br />
The chestnut pattering to the ground:</p>
<p>Calm and deep peace on this high wold,<br />
And on these dews that drench the furze, <br />
And all the silvery gossamers <br />
That twinkle into green and gold:</p>
<p>Calm and still light on yon great plain<br />
That sweeps with all its autumn bowers, <br />
And crowded farms and lessening towers, <br />
To mingle with the bounding main:</p>
<p>Calm and deep peace in this wide air,<br />
These leaves that redden to the fall; <br />
And in my heart, if calm at all, <br />
If any calm, a calm despair:</p>
<p>Calm on the seas, and silver sleep,<br />
And waves that sway themselves in rest, <br />
And dead calm in that noble breast <br />
Which heaves but with the heaving deep.</p>
<p>XII.</p>
<p>Lo, as a dove when up she springs<br />
To bear thro&#8217; Heaven a tale of woe, <br />
Some dolorous message knit below <br />
The wild pulsation of her wings;</p>
<p>Like her I go; I cannot stay;<br />
I leave this mortal ark behind, <br />
A weight of nerves without a mind, <br />
And leave the cliffs, and haste away</p>
<p>O&#8217;er ocean-mirrors rounded large,<br />
And reach the glow of southern skies, <br />
And see the sails at distance rise, <br />
And linger weeping on the marge,</p>
<p>And saying; &#8216;Comes he thus, my friend?<br />
Is this the end of all my care?&#8217; <br />
And circle moaning in the air: <br />
&#8216;Is this the end? Is this the end?&#8217;</p>
<p>And forward dart again, and play<br />
About the prow, and back return <br />
To where the body sits, and learn <br />
That I have been an hour away.</p>
<p>XIII.</p>
<p>Tears of the widower, when he sees<br />
A late-lost form that sleep reveals, <br />
And moves his doubtful arms, and feels <br />
Her place is empty, fall like these;</p>
<p>Which weep a loss for ever new,<br />
A void where heart on heart reposed; <br />
And, where warm hands have prest and closed, <br />
Silence, till I be silent too.</p>
<p>Which weeps the comrade of my choice,<br />
An awful thought, a life removed, <br />
The human-hearted man I loved, <br />
A Spirit, not a breathing voice.</p>
<p>Come Time, and teach me, many years,<br />
I do not suffer in a dream; <br />
For now so strange do these things seem, <br />
Mine eyes have leisure for their tears;</p>
<p>My fancies time to rise on wing,<br />
And glance about the approaching sails, <br />
As tho&#8217; they brought but merchants&#8217; bales, <br />
And not the burthen that they bring.</p>
<p>XIV.</p>
<p>If one should bring me this report,<br />
That thou hadst touch&#8217;d the land to-day, <br />
And I went down unto the quay, <br />
And found thee lying in the port;</p>
<p>And standing, muffled round with woe,<br />
Should see thy passengers in rank <br />
Come stepping lightly down the plank, <br />
And beckoning unto those they know;</p>
<p>And if along with these should come<br />
The man I held as half-divine; <br />
Should strike a sudden hand in mine, <br />
And ask a thousand things of home;</p>
<p>And I should tell him all my pain,<br />
And how my life had droop&#8217;d of late, <br />
And he should sorrow o&#8217;er my state <br />
And marvel what possess&#8217;d my brain;</p>
<p>And I perceived no touch of change,<br />
No hint of death in all his frame, <br />
But found him all in all the same, <br />
I should not feel it to be strange.</p>
<p>XV.</p>
<p>To-night the winds begin to rise<br />
And roar from yonder dropping day: <br />
The last red leaf is whirl&#8217;d away, <br />
The rooks are blown about the skies;</p>
<p>The forest crack&#8217;d, the waters curl&#8217;d,<br />
The cattle huddled on the lea; <br />
And wildly dash&#8217;d on tower and tree <br />
The sunbeam strikes along the world:</p>
<p>And but for fancies, which aver<br />
That all thy motions gently pass <br />
Athwart a plane of molten glass, <br />
I scarce could brook the strain and stir</p>
<p>That makes the barren branches loud;<br />
And but for fear it is not so, <br />
The wild unrest that lives in woe <br />
Would dote and pore on yonder cloud</p>
<p>That rises upward always higher,<br />
And onward drags a labouring breast, <br />
And topples round the dreary west, <br />
A looming bastion fringed with fire.</p>
<p>XVI.</p>
<p>What words are these have fall&#8217;n from me?<br />
Can calm despair and wild unrest <br />
Be tenants of a single breast, <br />
Or sorrow such a changeling be?</p>
<p>Or doth she only seem to take<br />
The touch of change in calm or storm; <br />
But knows no more of transient form <br />
In her deep self, than some dead lake</p>
<p>That holds the shadow of a lark<br />
Hung in the shadow of a heaven? <br />
Or has the shock, so harshly given, <br />
Confused me like the unhappy bark</p>
<p>That strikes by night a craggy shelf,<br />
And staggers blindly ere she sink? <br />
And stunn&#8217;d me from my power to think <br />
And all my knowledge of myself;</p>
<p>And made me that delirious man<br />
Whose fancy fuses old and new, <br />
And flashes into false and true, <br />
And mingles all without a plan?</p>
<p>XVII.</p>
<p>Thou comest, much wept for: such a breeze<br />
Compell&#8217;d thy canvas, and my prayer <br />
Was as the whisper of an air <br />
To breathe thee over lonely seas.</p>
<p>For I in spirit saw thee move<br />
Thro&#8217; circles of the bounding sky, <br />
Week after week: the days go by: <br />
Come quick, thou bringest all I love.</p>
<p>Henceforth, wherever thou may&#8217;st roam,<br />
My blessing, like a line of light, <br />
Is on the waters day and night, <br />
And like a beacon guards thee home.</p>
<p>So may whatever tempest mars<br />
Mid-ocean, spare thee, sacred bark; <br />
And balmy drops in summer dark <br />
Slide from the bosom of the stars.</p>
<p>So kind an office hath been done,<br />
Such precious relics brought by thee; <br />
The dust of him I shall not see <br />
Till all my widow&#8217;d race be run.</p>
<p>XVIII.</p>
<p>&#8216;Tis well; &#8217;tis something; we may stand<br />
Where he in English earth is laid, <br />
And from his ashes may be made <br />
The violet of his native land.</p>
<p>&#8216;Tis little; but it looks in truth<br />
As if the quiet bones were blest <br />
Among familiar names to rest <br />
And in the places of his youth.</p>
<p>Come then, pure hands, and bear the head<br />
That sleeps or wears the mask of sleep, <br />
And come, whatever loves to weep, <br />
And hear the ritual of the dead.</p>
<p>Ah yet, ev&#8217;n yet, if this might be,<br />
I, falling on his faithful heart, <br />
Would breathing thro&#8217; his lips impart <br />
The life that almost dies in me;</p>
<p>That dies not, but endures with pain,<br />
And slowly forms the the firmer mind, <br />
Treasuring the look it cannot find, <br />
The words that are not heard again.</p>
<p>XIX.</p>
<p>The Danube to the Severn gave<br />
The darken&#8217;d heart that beat no more; <br />
They laid him by the pleasant shore, <br />
And in the hearing of the wave.</p>
<p>There twice a day the Severn fills;<br />
That salt sea-water passes by, <br />
And hushes half the babbling Wye, <br />
And makes a silence in the hills.</p>
<p>The Wye is hush&#8217;d nor moved along,<br />
And hush&#8217;d my deepest grief of all, <br />
When fill&#8217;d with tears that cannot fall, <br />
I brim with sorrow drowning song.</p>
<p>The tide flows down, the wave again<br />
Is vocal in its wooded walls; <br />
My deeper anguish also falls, <br />
And I can speak a little then.</p>
<p>XX.</p>
<p>The lesser griefs that may be said,<br />
That breathe a thousand tender vows, <br />
Are but as servants in a house <br />
Where lies the master newly dead;</p>
<p>Who speak their feeling as it is,<br />
And weep the fulness from the mind: <br />
&#8216;It will be hard,&#8217; they say, &#8216;to find <br />
Another service such as this.&#8217;</p>
<p>My lighter moods are like to these,<br />
That out of words a comfort win; <br />
But there are other griefs within, <br />
And tears that at their fountain freeze;</p>
<p>For by the hearth the children sit<br />
Cold in that atmosphere of Death, <br />
And scarce endure to draw the breath, <br />
Or like to noiseless phantoms flit:</p>
<p>But open converse is there none,<br />
So much the vital spirits sink <br />
To see the vacant chair, and think, <br />
&#8216;How good! how kind! and he is gone.&#8217;</p>
