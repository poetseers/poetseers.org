				<p>The Story of Orpheus and Eurydice</p>
<p>Thence, in his saffron robe, for distant Thrace, <br />
Hymen departs, thro&#8217; air&#8217;s unmeasur&#8217;d space; <br />
By Orpheus call&#8217;d, the nuptial Pow&#8217;r attends, <br />
But with ill-omen&#8217;d augury descends; <br />
Nor chearful look&#8217;d the God, nor prosp&#8217;rous spoke, <br />
Nor blaz&#8217;d his torch, but wept in hissing smoke. <br />
In vain they whirl it round, in vain they shake, <br />
No rapid motion can its flames awake. <br />
With dread these inauspicious signs were view&#8217;d, <br />
And soon a more disastrous end ensu&#8217;d; <br />
For as the bride, amid the Naiad train, <br />
Ran joyful, sporting o&#8217;er the flow&#8217;ry plain, <br />
A venom&#8217;d viper bit her as she pass&#8217;d; <br />
Instant she fell, and sudden breath&#8217;d her last.</p>
<p>When long his loss the Thracian had deplor&#8217;d, <br />
Not by superior Pow&#8217;rs to be restor&#8217;d; <br />
Inflam&#8217;d by love, and urg&#8217;d by deep despair, <br />
He leaves the realms of light, and upper air; <br />
Daring to tread the dark Tenarian road, <br />
And tempt the shades in their obscure abode; <br />
Thro&#8217; gliding spectres of th&#8217; interr&#8217;d to go, <br />
And phantom people of the world below: <br />
Persephone he seeks, and him who reigns <br />
O&#8217;er ghosts, and Hell&#8217;s uncomfortable plains. <br />
Arriv&#8217;d, he, tuning to his voice his strings, <br />
Thus to the king and queen of shadows sings.</p>
<p>Ye Pow&#8217;rs, who under Earth your realms extend, <br />
To whom all mortals must one day descend; <br />
If here &#8217;tis granted sacred truth to tell: <br />
I come not curious to explore your Hell; <br />
Nor come to boast (by vain ambition fir&#8217;d) <br />
How Cerberus at my approach retir&#8217;d. <br />
My wife alone I seek; for her lov&#8217;d sake <br />
These terrors I support, this journey take. <br />
She, luckless wandring, or by fate mis-led, <br />
Chanc&#8217;d on a lurking viper&#8217;s crest to tread; <br />
The vengeful beast, enflam&#8217;d with fury, starts, <br />
And thro&#8217; her heel his deathful venom darts. <br />
Thus was she snatch&#8217;d untimely to her tomb; <br />
Her growing years cut short, and springing bloom. <br />
Long I my loss endeavour&#8217;d to sustain, <br />
And strongly strove, but strove, alas, in vain: <br />
At length I yielded, won by mighty love; <br />
Well known is that omnipotence above! <br />
But here, I doubt, his unfelt influence fails; <br />
And yet a hope within my heart prevails. <br />
That here, ev&#8217;n here, he has been known of old; <br />
At least if truth be by tradition told; <br />
If fame of former rapes belief may find, <br />
You both by love, and love alone, were join&#8217;d. <br />
Now, by the horrors which these realms surround; <br />
By the vast chaos of these depths profound; <br />
By the sad silence which eternal reigns <br />
O&#8217;er all the waste of these wide-stretching plains; <br />
Let me again Eurydice receive, <br />
Let Fate her quick-spun thread of life re-weave. <br />
All our possessions are but loans from you, <br />
And soon, or late, you must be paid your due; <br />
Hither we haste to human-kind&#8217;s last seat, <br />
Your endless empire, and our sure retreat. <br />
She too, when ripen&#8217;d years she shall attain, <br />
Must, of avoidless right, be yours again: <br />
I but the transient use of that require, <br />
Which soon, too soon, I must resign entire. <br />
But if the destinies refuse my vow, <br />
And no remission of her doom allow; <br />
Know, I&#8217;m determin&#8217;d to return no more; <br />
So both retain, or both to life restore.</p>
<p>Thus, while the bard melodiously complains, <br />
And to his lyre accords his vocal strains, <br />
The very bloodless shades attention keep, <br />
And silent, seem compassionate to weep; <br />
Ev&#8217;n Tantalus his flood unthirsty views, <br />
Nor flies the stream, nor he the stream pursues; <br />
Ixion&#8217;s wond&#8217;ring wheel its whirl suspends, <br />
And the voracious vulture, charm&#8217;d, attends; <br />
No more the Belides their toil bemoan, <br />
And Sisiphus reclin&#8217;d, sits list&#8217;ning on his stone.</p>
<p>Then first (&#8217;tis said) by sacred verse subdu&#8217;d, <br />
The Furies felt their cheeks with tears bedew&#8217;d: <br />
Nor could the rigid king, or queen of Hell, <br />
Th&#8217; impulse of pity in their hearts repell.</p>
<p>Now, from a troop of shades that last arriv&#8217;d, <br />
Eurydice was call&#8217;d, and stood reviv&#8217;d: <br />
Slow she advanc&#8217;d, and halting seem to feel <br />
The fatal wound, yet painful in her heel. <br />
Thus he obtains the suit so much desir&#8217;d, <br />
On strict observance of the terms requir&#8217;d: <br />
For if, before he reach the realms of air, <br />
He backward cast his eyes to view the fair, <br />
The forfeit grant, that instant, void is made, <br />
And she for ever left a lifeless shade.</p>
<p>Now thro&#8217; the noiseless throng their way they bend, <br />
And both with pain the rugged road ascend; <br />
Dark was the path, and difficult, and steep, <br />
And thick with vapours from the smoaky deep. <br />
They well-nigh now had pass&#8217;d the bounds of night, <br />
And just approach&#8217;d the margin of the light, <br />
When he, mistrusting lest her steps might stray, <br />
And gladsome of the glympse of dawning day, <br />
His longing eyes, impatient, backward cast <br />
To catch a lover&#8217;s look, but look&#8217;d his last; <br />
For, instant dying, she again descends, <br />
While he to empty air his arms extends. <br />
Again she dy&#8217;d, nor yet her lord reprov&#8217;d; <br />
What could she say, but that too well he lov&#8217;d? <br />
One last farewell she spoke, which scarce he heard; <br />
So soon she drop&#8217;d, so sudden disappear&#8217;d.</p>
<p>All stunn&#8217;d he stood, when thus his wife he view&#8217;d <br />
By second Fate, and double death subdu&#8217;d: <br />
Not more amazement by that wretch was shown, <br />
Whom Cerberus beholding, turn&#8217;d to stone; <br />
Nor Olenus cou&#8217;d more astonish&#8217;d look, <br />
When on himself Lethaea&#8217;s fault he took, <br />
His beauteous wife, who too secure had dar&#8217;d <br />
Her face to vye with Goddesses compar&#8217;d: <br />
Once join&#8217;d by love, they stand united still, <br />
Turn&#8217;d to contiguous rocks on Ida&#8217;s hill.</p>
<p>Now to repass the Styx in vain he tries, <br />
Charon averse, his pressing suit denies. <br />
Sev&#8217;n days entire, along th&#8217; infernal shores, <br />
Disconsolate, the bard Eurydice deplores; <br />
Defil&#8217;d with filth his robe, with tears his cheeks, <br />
No sustenance but grief, and cares, he seeks: <br />
Of rigid Fate incessant he complains, <br />
And Hell&#8217;s inexorable Gods arraigns. <br />
This ended, to high Rhodope he hastes, <br />
And Haemus&#8217; mountain, bleak with northern blasts.</p>
<p>And now his yearly race the circling sun <br />
Had thrice compleat thro&#8217; wat&#8217;ry Pisces run, <br />
Since Orpheus fled the face of womankind, <br />
And all soft union with the sex declin&#8217;d. <br />
Whether his ill success this change had bred, <br />
Or binding vows made to his former bed; <br />
Whate&#8217;er the cause, in vain the nymphs contest, <br />
With rival eyes to warm his frozen breast: <br />
For ev&#8217;ry nymph with love his lays inspir&#8217;d, <br />
But ev&#8217;ry nymph repuls&#8217;d, with grief retir&#8217;d.</p>
<p>A hill there was, and on that hill a mead, <br />
With verdure thick, but destitute of shade. <br />
Where, now, the Muse&#8217;s son no sooner sings, <br />
No sooner strikes his sweet resounding strings. <br />
But distant groves the flying sounds receive, <br />
And list&#8217;ning trees their rooted stations leave; <br />
Themselves transplanting, all around they grow, <br />
And various shades their various kinds bestow. <br />
Here, tall Chaonian oaks their branches spread, <br />
While weeping poplars there erect their head. <br />
The foodful Esculus here shoots his leaves, <br />
That turf soft lime-tree, this, fat beach receives; <br />
Here, brittle hazels, lawrels here advance, <br />
And there tough ash to form the heroe&#8217;s lance; <br />
Here silver firs with knotless trunks ascend, <br />
There, scarlet oaks beneath their acorns bend. <br />
That spot admits the hospitable plane, <br />
On this, the maple grows with clouded grain; <br />
Here, watry willows are with Lotus seen; <br />
There, tamarisk, and box for ever green. <br />
With double hue here mirtles grace the ground, <br />
And laurestines, with purple berries crown&#8217;d. <br />
With pliant feet, now, ivies this way wind, <br />
Vines yonder rise, and elms with vines entwin&#8217;d. <br />
Wild Ornus now, the pitch-tree next takes root, <br />
And Arbutus adorn&#8217;d with blushing fruit. <br />
Then easy-bending palms, the victor&#8217;s prize, <br />
And pines erect with bristly tops arise. <br />
For Rhea grateful still the pine remains, <br />
For Atys still some favour she retains; <br />
He once in human shape her breast had warm&#8217;d, <br />
And now is cherish&#8217;d, to a tree transform&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The Fable of Cyparissus</p>
<p>Amid the throng of this promiscuous wood, <br />
With pointed top, the taper cypress stood; <br />
A tree, which once a youth, and heav&#8217;nly fair, <br />
Was of that deity the darling care, <br />
Whose hand adapts, with equal skill, the strings <br />
To bows with which he kills, and harps to which he sings.</p>
<p>For heretofore, a mighty stag was bred, <br />
Which on the fertile fields of Caea fed; <br />
In shape and size he all his kind excell&#8217;d, <br />
And to Carthaean nymphs was sacred held. <br />
His beamy head, with branches high display&#8217;d, <br />
Afforded to itself an ample shade; <br />
His horns were gilt, and his smooth neck was grac&#8217;d <br />
With silver collars thick with gems enchas&#8217;d: <br />
A silver boss upon his forehead hung, <br />
And brazen pendants in his ear-rings rung. <br />
Frequenting houses, he familiar grew, <br />
And learnt by custom, Nature to subdue; <br />
&#8216;Till by degrees, of fear, and wildness, broke, <br />
Ev&#8217;n stranger hands his proffer&#8217;d neck might stroak.</p>
<p>Much was the beast by Caea&#8217;s youth caress&#8217;d, <br />
But thou, sweet Cyparissus, lov&#8217;dst him best: <br />
By thee, to pastures fresh, he oft was led, <br />
By thee oft water&#8217;d at the fountain&#8217;s head: <br />
His horns with garlands, now, by thee were ty&#8217;d, <br />
And, now, thou on his back wou&#8217;dst wanton ride; <br />
Now here, now there wou&#8217;dst bound along the plains, <br />
Ruling his tender mouth with purple reins.</p>
<p>&#8216;Twas when the summer sun, at noon of day, <br />
Thro&#8217; glowing Cancer shot his burning ray, <br />
&#8216;Twas then, the fav&#8217;rite stag, in cool retreat, <br />
Had sought a shelter from the scorching heat; <br />
Along the grass his weary limbs he laid, <br />
Inhaling freshness from the breezy shade: <br />
When Cyparissus with his pointed dart, <br />
Unknowing, pierc&#8217;d him to the panting heart. <br />
But when the youth, surpriz&#8217;d, his error found, <br />
And saw him dying of the cruel wound, <br />
Himself he would have slain thro&#8217; desp&#8217;rate grief: <br />
What said not Phoebus, that might yield relief! <br />
To cease his mourning, he the boy desir&#8217;d, <br />
Or mourn no more than such a loss requir&#8217;d. <br />
But he, incessant griev&#8217;d: at length address&#8217;d <br />
To the superior Pow&#8217;rs a last request; <br />
Praying, in expiation of his crime, <br />
Thenceforth to mourn to all succeeding time.</p>
<p>And now, of blood exhausted he appears, <br />
Drain&#8217;d by a torrent of continual tears; <br />
The fleshy colour in his body fades, <br />
And a green tincture all his limbs invades; <br />
From his fair head, where curling locks late hung, <br />
A horrid bush with bristled branches sprung, <br />
Which stiffning by degrees, its stem extends, <br />
&#8216;Till to the starry skies the spire ascends.</p>
<p>Apollo sad look&#8217;d on, and sighing, cry&#8217;d, <br />
Then, be for ever, what thy pray&#8217;r imply&#8217;d: <br />
Bemoan&#8217;d by me, in others grief excite; <br />
And still preside at ev&#8217;ry fun&#8217;ral rite.</p>
<p>Thus the sweet artist in a wondrous shade <br />
Of verdant trees, which harmony had made, <br />
Encircled sate, with his own triumphs crown&#8217;d, <br />
Of listning birds, and savages around. <br />
Again the trembling strings he dext&#8217;rous tries, <br />
Again from discord makes soft musick rise. <br />
Then tunes his voice: O Muse, from whom I sprung, <br />
Jove be my theme, and thou inspire my song. <br />
To Jove my grateful voice I oft have rais&#8217;d, <br />
Oft his almighty pow&#8217;r with pleasure prais&#8217;d. <br />
I sung the giants in a solemn strain, <br />
Blasted, and thunder-struck on Phlegra&#8217;s plain. <br />
Now be my lyre in softer accents mov&#8217;d, <br />
To sing of blooming boys by Gods belov&#8217;d; <br />
And to relate what virgins, void of shame, <br />
Have suffer&#8217;d vengeance for a lawless flame.</p>
<p>The King of Gods once felt the burning joy, <br />
And sigh&#8217;d for lovely Ganimede of Troy: <br />
Long was he puzzled to assume a shape <br />
Most fit, and expeditious for the rape; <br />
A bird&#8217;s was proper, yet he scorns to wear <br />
Any but that which might his thunder bear. <br />
Down with his masquerading wings he flies, <br />
And bears the little Trojan to the skies; <br />
Where now, in robes of heav&#8217;nly purple drest, <br />
He serves the nectar at th&#8217; Almighty&#8217;s feast, <br />
To slighted Juno an unwelcome guest.</p>
<p>Hyacinthus transform&#8217;d into a Flower</p>
<p>Phoebus for thee too, Hyacinth, design&#8217;d <br />
A place among the Gods, had Fate been kind: <br />
Yet this he gave; as oft as wintry rains <br />
Are past, and vernal breezes sooth the plains, <br />
From the green turf a purple flow&#8217;r you rise, <br />
And with your fragrant breath perfume the skies.</p>
<p>You when alive were Phoebus&#8217; darling boy; <br />
In you he plac&#8217;d his Heav&#8217;n, and fix&#8217;d his joy: <br />
Their God the Delphic priests consult in vain; <br />
Eurotas now he loves, and Sparta&#8217;s plain: <br />
His hands the use of bow and harp forget, <br />
And hold the dogs, or bear the corded net; <br />
O&#8217;er hanging cliffs swift he pursues the game; <br />
Each hour his pleasure, each augments his flame.</p>
<p>The mid-day sun now shone with equal light <br />
Between the past, and the succeeding night; <br />
They strip, then, smooth&#8217;d with suppling oyl, essay <br />
To pitch the rounded quoit, their wonted play: <br />
A well-pois&#8217;d disk first hasty Phoebus threw, <br />
It cleft the air, and whistled as it flew; <br />
It reach&#8217;d the mark, a most surprizing length; <br />
Which spoke an equal share of art, and strength. <br />
Scarce was it fall&#8217;n, when with too eager hand <br />
Young Hyacinth ran to snatch it from the sand; <br />
But the curst orb, which met a stony soil, <br />
Flew in his face with violent recoil. <br />
Both faint, both pale, and breathless now appear, <br />
The boy with pain, the am&#8217;rous God with fear. <br />
He ran, and rais&#8217;d him bleeding from the ground, <br />
Chafes his cold limbs, and wipes the fatal wound: <br />
Then herbs of noblest juice in vain applies; <br />
The wound is mortal, and his skill defies.</p>
<p>As in a water&#8217;d garden&#8217;s blooming walk, <br />
When some rude hand has bruis&#8217;d its tender stalk, <br />
A fading lilly droops its languid head, <br />
And bends to earth, its life, and beauty fled: <br />
So Hyacinth, with head reclin&#8217;d, decays, <br />
And, sickning, now no more his charms displays.</p>
<p>O thou art gone, my boy, Apollo cry&#8217;d, <br />
Defrauded of thy youth in all its pride! <br />
Thou, once my joy, art all my sorrow now; <br />
And to my guilty hand my grief I owe. <br />
Yet from my self I might the fault remove, <br />
Unless to sport, and play, a fault should prove, <br />
Unless it too were call&#8217;d a fault to love. <br />
Oh cou&#8217;d I for thee, or but with thee, dye! <br />
But cruel Fates to me that pow&#8217;r deny. <br />
Yet on my tongue thou shalt for ever dwell; <br />
Thy name my lyre shall sound, my verse shall tell; <br />
And to a flow&#8217;r transform&#8217;d, unheard-of yet, <br />
Stamp&#8217;d on thy leaves my cries thou shalt repeat. <br />
The time shall come, prophetick I foreknow, <br />
When, joyn&#8217;d to thee, a mighty chief shall grow, <br />
And with my plaints his name thy leaf shall show.</p>
<p>While Phoebus thus the laws of Fate reveal&#8217;d, <br />
Behold, the blood which stain&#8217;d the verdant field, <br />
Is blood no longer; but a flow&#8217;r full blown, <br />
Far brighter than the Tyrian scarlet shone. <br />
A lilly&#8217;s form it took; its purple hue <br />
Was all that made a diff&#8217;rence to the view, <br />
Nor stop&#8217;d he here; the God upon its leaves <br />
The sad expression of his sorrow weaves; <br />
And to this hour the mournful purple wears <br />
Ai, Ai, inscrib&#8217;d in funeral characters. <br />
Nor are the Spartans, who so much are fam&#8217;d <br />
For virtue, of their Hyacinth asham&#8217;d; <br />
But still with pompous woe, and solemn state, <br />
The Hyacinthian feasts they yearly celebrate</p>
<p>The Transformations of the Cerastae and Propoetides</p>
<p>Enquire of Amathus, whose wealthy ground <br />
With veins of every metal does abound, <br />
If she to her Propoetides wou&#8217;d show, <br />
The honour Sparta does to him allow? <br />
Nor more, she&#8217;d say, such wretches wou&#8217;d we grace, <br />
Than those whose crooked horns deform&#8217;d their face, <br />
From thence Cerastae call&#8217;d, an impious race: <br />
Before whose gates a rev&#8217;rend altar stood, <br />
To Jove inscrib&#8217;d, the hospitable God: <br />
This had some stranger seen with gore besmear&#8217;d, <br />
The blood of lambs, and bulls it had appear&#8217;d: <br />
Their slaughter&#8217;d guests it was; nor flock nor herd.</p>
<p>Venus these barb&#8217;rous sacrifices view&#8217;d <br />
With just abhorrence, and with wrath pursu&#8217;d: <br />
At first, to punish such nefarious crimes, <br />
Their towns she meant to leave, her once-lov&#8217;d climes: <br />
But why, said she, for their offence shou&#8217;d I <br />
My dear delightful plains, and cities fly? <br />
No, let the impious people, who have sinn&#8217;d, <br />
A punishment in death, or exile, find: <br />
If death, or exile too severe be thought, <br />
Let them in some vile shape bemoan their fault. <br />
While next her mind a proper form employs, <br />
Admonish&#8217;d by their horns, she fix&#8217;d her choice. <br />
Their former crest remains upon their heads, <br />
And their strong limbs an ox&#8217;s shape invades.</p>
<p>The blasphemous Propoetides deny&#8217;d <br />
Worship of Venus, and her pow&#8217;r defy&#8217;d: <br />
But soon that pow&#8217;r they felt, the first that sold <br />
Their lewd embraces to the world for gold. <br />
Unknowing how to blush, and shameless grown, <br />
A small transition changes them to stone.</p>
<p>The Story of Pygmalion and the Statue</p>
<p>Pygmalion loathing their lascivious life, <br />
Abhorr&#8217;d all womankind, but most a wife: <br />
So single chose to live, and shunn&#8217;d to wed, <br />
Well pleas&#8217;d to want a consort of his bed. <br />
Yet fearing idleness, the nurse of ill, <br />
In sculpture exercis&#8217;d his happy skill; <br />
And carv&#8217;d in iv&#8217;ry such a maid, so fair, <br />
As Nature could not with his art compare, <br />
Were she to work; but in her own defence <br />
Must take her pattern here, and copy hence. <br />
Pleas&#8217;d with his idol, he commends, admires, <br />
Adores; and last, the thing ador&#8217;d, desires. <br />
A very virgin in her face was seen, <br />
And had she mov&#8217;d, a living maid had been: <br />
One wou&#8217;d have thought she cou&#8217;d have stirr&#8217;d, but strove <br />
With modesty, and was asham&#8217;d to move. <br />
Art hid with art, so well perform&#8217;d the cheat, <br />
It caught the carver with his own deceit: <br />
He knows &#8217;tis madness, yet he must adore, <br />
And still the more he knows it, loves the more: <br />
The flesh, or what so seems, he touches oft, <br />
Which feels so smooth, that he believes it soft. <br />
Fir&#8217;d with this thought, at once he strain&#8217;d the breast, <br />
And on the lips a burning kiss impress&#8217;d. <br />
&#8216;Tis true, the harden&#8217;d breast resists the gripe, <br />
And the cold lips return a kiss unripe: <br />
But when, retiring back, he look&#8217;d again, <br />
To think it iv&#8217;ry, was a thought too mean: <br />
So wou&#8217;d believe she kiss&#8217;d, and courting more, <br />
Again embrac&#8217;d her naked body o&#8217;er; <br />
And straining hard the statue, was afraid <br />
His hands had made a dint, and hurt his maid: <br />
Explor&#8217;d her limb by limb, and fear&#8217;d to find <br />
So rude a gripe had left a livid mark behind: <br />
With flatt&#8217;ry now he seeks her mind to move, <br />
And now with gifts (the pow&#8217;rful bribes of love), <br />
He furnishes her closet first; and fills <br />
The crowded shelves with rarities of shells; <br />
Adds orient pearls, which from the conchs he drew, <br />
And all the sparkling stones of various hue: <br />
And parrots, imitating human tongue, <br />
And singing-birds in silver cages hung: <br />
And ev&#8217;ry fragrant flow&#8217;r, and od&#8217;rous green, <br />
Were sorted well, with lumps of amber laid between: <br />
Rich fashionable robes her person deck, <br />
Pendants her ears, and pearls adorn her neck: <br />
Her taper&#8217;d fingers too with rings are grac&#8217;d, <br />
And an embroider&#8217;d zone surrounds her slender waste. <br />
Thus like a queen array&#8217;d, so richly dress&#8217;d, <br />
Beauteous she shew&#8217;d, but naked shew&#8217;d the best. <br />
Then, from the floor, he rais&#8217;d a royal bed, <br />
With cov&#8217;rings of Sydonian purple spread: <br />
The solemn rites perform&#8217;d, he calls her bride, <br />
With blandishments invites her to his side; <br />
And as she were with vital sense possess&#8217;d, <br />
Her head did on a plumy pillow rest.</p>
<p>The feast of Venus came, a solemn day, <br />
To which the Cypriots due devotion pay; <br />
With gilded horns the milk-white heifers led, <br />
Slaughter&#8217;d before the sacred altars, bled.</p>
<p>Pygmalion off&#8217;ring, first approach&#8217;d the shrine, <br />
And then with pray&#8217;rs implor&#8217;d the Pow&#8217;rs divine: <br />
Almighty Gods, if all we mortals want, <br />
If all we can require, be yours to grant; <br />
Make this fair statue mine, he wou&#8217;d have said, <br />
But chang&#8217;d his words for shame; and only pray&#8217;d, <br />
Give me the likeness of my iv&#8217;ry maid.</p>
<p>The golden Goddess, present at the pray&#8217;r, <br />
Well knew he meant th&#8217; inanimated fair, <br />
And gave the sign of granting his desire; <br />
For thrice in chearful flames ascends the fire. <br />
The youth, returning to his mistress, hies, <br />
And impudent in hope, with ardent eyes, <br />
And beating breast, by the dear statue lies. <br />
He kisses her white lips, renews the bliss, <br />
And looks, and thinks they redden at the kiss; <br />
He thought them warm before: nor longer stays, <br />
But next his hand on her hard bosom lays: <br />
Hard as it was, beginning to relent, <br />
It seem&#8217;d, the breast beneath his fingers bent; <br />
He felt again, his fingers made a print; <br />
&#8216;Twas flesh, but flesh so firm, it rose against the dint: <br />
The pleasing task he fails not to renew; <br />
Soft, and more soft at ev&#8217;ry touch it grew; <br />
Like pliant wax, when chasing hands reduce <br />
The former mass to form, and frame for use. <br />
He would believe, but yet is still in pain, <br />
And tries his argument of sense again, <br />
Presses the pulse, and feels the leaping vein. <br />
Convinc&#8217;d, o&#8217;erjoy&#8217;d, his studied thanks, and praise, <br />
To her, who made the miracle, he pays: <br />
Then lips to lips he join&#8217;d; now freed from fear, <br />
He found the savour of the kiss sincere: <br />
At this the waken&#8217;d image op&#8217;d her eyes, <br />
And view&#8217;d at once the light, and lover with surprize. <br />
The Goddess, present at the match she made, <br />
So bless&#8217;d the bed, such fruitfulness convey&#8217;d, <br />
That ere ten months had sharpen&#8217;d either horn, <br />
To crown their bliss, a lovely boy was born; <br />
Paphos his name, who grown to manhood, wall&#8217;d <br />
The city Paphos, from the founder call&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The Story of of Cinyras and Myrrha</p>
<p>Nor him alone produc&#8217;d the fruitful queen; <br />
But Cinyras, who like his sire had been <br />
A happy prince, had he not been a sire. <br />
Daughters, and fathers, from my song retire; <br />
I sing of horror; and could I prevail, <br />
You shou&#8217;d not hear, or not believe my tale. <br />
Yet if the pleasure of my song be such, <br />
That you will hear, and credit me too much, <br />
Attentive listen to the last event, <br />
And, with the sin, believe the punishment: <br />
Since Nature cou&#8217;d behold so dire a crime, <br />
I gratulate at least my native clime, <br />
That such a land, which such a monster bore, <br />
So far is distant from our Thracian shore. <br />
Let Araby extol her happy coast, <br />
Her cinamon, and sweet Amomum boast, <br />
Her fragrant flow&#8217;rs, her trees with precious tears, <br />
Her second harvests, and her double years; <br />
How can the land be call&#8217;d so bless&#8217;d, that Myrrha bears? <br />
Nor all her od&#8217;rous tears can cleanse her crime; <br />
Her Plant alone deforms the happy clime: <br />
Cupid denies to have inflam&#8217;d thy heart, <br />
Disowns thy love, and vindicates his dart: <br />
Some Fury gave thee those infernal pains, <br />
And shot her venom&#8217;d vipers in thy veins. <br />
To hate thy sire, had merited a curse; <br />
But such an impious love deserv&#8217;d a worse. <br />
The neighb&#8217;ring monarchs, by thy beauty led, <br />
Contend in crowds, ambitious of thy bed: <br />
The world is at thy choice; except but one, <br />
Except but him, thou canst not chuse, alone. <br />
She knew it too, the miserable maid, <br />
Ere impious love her better thoughts betray&#8217;d, <br />
And thus within her secret soul she said: <br />
Ah Myrrha! whither wou&#8217;d thy wishes tend? <br />
Ye Gods, ye sacred laws, my soul defend <br />
From such a crime as all mankind detest, <br />
And never lodg&#8217;d before in human breast! <br />
But is it sin? Or makes my mind alone <br />
Th&#8217; imagin&#8217;d sin? For Nature makes it none. <br />
What tyrant then these envious laws began, <br />
Made not for any other beast, but Man! <br />
The father-bull his daughter may bestride, <br />
The horse may make his mother-mare a bride; <br />
What piety forbids the lusty ram, <br />
Or more salacious goat, to rut their dam? <br />
The hen is free to wed the chick she bore, <br />
And make a husband, whom she hatch&#8217;d before. <br />
All creatures else are of a happier kind, <br />
Whom nor ill-natur&#8217;d laws from pleasure bind, <br />
Nor thoughts of sin disturb their peace of mind. <br />
But Man a slave of his own making lives; <br />
The fool denies himself what Nature gives: <br />
Too-busie senates, with an over-care, <br />
To make us better than our kind can bear, <br />
Have dash&#8217;d a spice of envy in the laws, <br />
And straining up too high, have spoil&#8217;d the cause. <br />
Yet some wise nations break their cruel chains, <br />
And own no laws, but those which love ordains; <br />
Where happy daughters with their sires are join&#8217;d, <br />
And piety is doubly paid in kind. <br />
O that I had been born in such a clime, <br />
Not here, where &#8217;tis the country makes the crime! <br />
But whither wou&#8217;d my impious fancy stray? <br />
Hence hopes, and ye forbidden thoughts away! <br />
His worth deserves to kindle my desires, <br />
But with the love, that daughters bear to sires. <br />
Then had not Cinyras my father been, <br />
What hinder&#8217;d Myrrha&#8217;s hopes to be his queen? <br />
But the perverseness of my fate is such, <br />
That he&#8217;s not mine, because he&#8217;s mine too much: <br />
Our kindred-blood debars a better tie; <br />
He might be nearer, were he not so nigh. <br />
Eyes, and their objects, never must unite; <br />
Some distance is requir&#8217;d to help the sight: <br />
Fain wou&#8217;d I travel to some foreign shore, <br />
Never to see my native country more, <br />
So might I to my self my self restore; <br />
So might my mind these impious thoughts remove, <br />
And ceasing to behold, might cease to love. <br />
But stay I must, to feed my famish&#8217;d sight, <br />
To talk, to kiss, and more, if more I might: <br />
More, impious maid! What more canst thou design? <br />
To make a monstrous mixture in thy line, <br />
And break all statutes human and divine! <br />
Can&#8217;st thou be call&#8217;d (to save thy wretched life) <br />
Thy mother&#8217;s rival, and thy father&#8217;s wife? <br />
Confound so many sacred names in one, <br />
Thy brother&#8217;s mother! Sister to thy son! <br />
And fear&#8217;st thou not to see th&#8217; infernal bands, <br />
Their heads with snakes; with torches arm&#8217;d their hands <br />
Full at thy face th&#8217; avenging brands to bear, <br />
And shake the serpents from their hissing hair; <br />
But thou in time th&#8217; increasing ill controul, <br />
Nor first debauch the body by the soul; <br />
Secure the sacred quiet of thy mind, <br />
And keep the sanctions Nature has design&#8217;d. <br />
Suppose I shou&#8217;d attempt, th&#8217; attempt were vain, <br />
No thoughts like mine, his sinless soul profane; <br />
Observant of the right: and o that he <br />
Cou&#8217;d cure my madness, or be mad like me! <br />
Thus she: but Cinyras, who daily sees <br />
A crowd of noble suitors at his knees, <br />
Among so many, knew not whom to chuse, <br />
Irresolute to grant, or to refuse. <br />
But having told their names, enquir&#8217;d of her <br />
Who pleas&#8217;d her best, and whom she would prefer. <br />
The blushing maid stood silent with surprize, <br />
And on her father fix&#8217;d her ardent eyes, <br />
And looking sigh&#8217;d, and as she sigh&#8217;d, began <br />
Round tears to shed, that scalded as they ran. <br />
The tender sire, who saw her blush, and cry, <br />
Ascrib&#8217;d it all to maiden modesty, <br />
And dry&#8217;d the falling drops, and yet more kind, <br />
He stroak&#8217;d her cheeks, and holy kisses join&#8217;d. <br />
She felt a secret venom fire her blood, <br />
And found more pleasure, than a daughter shou&#8217;d; <br />
And, ask&#8217;d again what lover of the crew <br />
She lik&#8217;d the best, she answer&#8217;d, One like you. <br />
Mistaking what she meant, her pious will <br />
He prais&#8217;d, and bid her so continue still: <br />
The word of pious heard, she blush&#8217;d with shame <br />
Of secret guilt, and cou&#8217;d not bear the name.</p>
<p>&#8216;Twas now the mid of night, when slumbers close <br />
Our eyes, and sooth our cares with soft repose; <br />
But no repose cou&#8217;d wretched Myrrha find, <br />
Her body rouling, as she roul&#8217;d her mind: <br />
Mad with desire, she ruminates her sin, <br />
And wishes all her wishes o&#8217;er again: <br />
Now she despairs, and now resolves to try; <br />
Wou&#8217;d not, and wou&#8217;d again, she knows not why; <br />
Stops, and returns; makes, and retracts the vow; <br />
Fain wou&#8217;d begin, but understands not how. <br />
As when a pine is hew&#8217;d upon the plains, <br />
And the last mortal stroke alone remains, <br />
Lab&#8217;ring in pangs of death, and threatning all, <br />
This way, and that she nods, consid&#8217;ring where to fall: <br />
So Myrrha&#8217;s mind, impell&#8217;d on either side, <br />
Takes ev&#8217;ry bent, but cannot long abide; <br />
Irresolute on which she shou&#8217;d relie, <br />
At last, unfix&#8217;d in all, is only fix&#8217;d to die. <br />
On that sad thought she rests, resolv&#8217;d on death, <br />
She rises, and prepares to choak her breath: <br />
Then while about the beam her zone she ties, <br />
Dear Cinyras farewell, she softly cries; <br />
For thee I die, and only wish to be <br />
Not hated, when thou know&#8217;st die I for thee: <br />
Pardon the crime, in pity to the cause: <br />
This said, about her neck the noose she draws. <br />
The nurse, who lay without, her faithful guard, <br />
Though not the words, the murmurs over-heard; <br />
And sighs, and hollow sounds: surpriz&#8217;d with fright, <br />
She starts, and leaves her bed, and springs a light; <br />
Unlocks the door, and entring out of breath, <br />
The dying saw, and instruments of death; <br />
She shrieks, she cuts the zone with trembling haste, <br />
And in her arms her fainting charge embrac&#8217;d: <br />
Next (for she now had leisure for her tears), <br />
She weeping ask&#8217;d, in these her blooming years, <br />
What unforeseen misfortune caus&#8217;d her care, <br />
To loath her life, and languish in despair! <br />
The maid, with down-cast eyes, and mute with grief <br />
For death unfinish&#8217;d, and ill-tim&#8217;d relief, <br />
Stood sullen to her suit: the beldame press&#8217;d <br />
The more to know, and bar&#8217;d her wither&#8217;d breast, <br />
Adjur&#8217;d her by the kindly food she drew <br />
From those dry founts, her secret ill to shew. <br />
Sad Myrrha sigh&#8217;d, and turn&#8217;d her eyes aside: <br />
The nurse still urg&#8217;d, and wou&#8217;d not be deny&#8217;d: <br />
Nor only promis&#8217;d secresie, but pray&#8217;d <br />
She might have leave to give her offer&#8217;d aid. <br />
Good-will, she said, my want of strength supplies, <br />
And diligence shall give what age denies: <br />
If strong desires thy mind to fury move, <br />
With charms and med&#8217;cines I can cure thy love: <br />
If envious eyes their hurtuful rays have cast, <br />
More pow&#8217;rful verse shall free thee from the blast: <br />
If Heav&#8217;n offended sends thee this disease, <br />
Offended Heav&#8217;n with pray&#8217;rs we can appease. <br />
What then remains, that can these cares procure? <br />
Thy house is flourishing, thy fortune sure: <br />
Thy careful mother yet in health survives, <br />
And, to thy comfort, thy kind father lives. <br />
The virgin started at her father&#8217;s name, <br />
And sigh&#8217;d profoundly, conscious of the shame <br />
Nor yet the nurse her impious love divin&#8217;d, <br />
But yet surmis&#8217;d that love disturb&#8217;d her mind: <br />
Thus thinking, she pursu&#8217;d her point, and laid, <br />
And lull&#8217;d within her lap the mourning maid; <br />
Then softly sooth&#8217;d her thus; I guess your grief: <br />
You love, my child; your love shall find relief. <br />
My long-experienc&#8217;d age shall be your guide; <br />
Rely on that, and lay distrust aside. <br />
No breath of air shall on the secret blow, <br />
Nor shall (what most you fear) your father know. <br />
Struck once again, as with a thunder-clap, <br />
The guilty virgin bounded from her lap, <br />
And threw her body prostrate on the bed. <br />
And, to conceal her blushes, hid her head; <br />
There silent lay, and warn&#8217;d her with her hand <br />
To go: but she receiv&#8217;d not the command; <br />
Remaining still importunate to know: <br />
Then Myrrha thus: Or ask no more, or go; <br />
I pr&#8217;ythee go, or staying spare my shame; <br />
What thou would&#8217;st hear, is impious ev&#8217;n to name. <br />
At this, on high the beldame holds her hands, <br />
And trembling both with age, and terror stands; <br />
Adjures, and falling at her feet intreats, <br />
Sooths her with blandishments, and frights with threats, <br />
To tell the crime intended, or disclose <br />
What part of it she knew, if she no farther knows. <br />
And last, if conscious to her counsel made, <br />
Confirms anew the promise of her aid. <br />
Now Myrrha rais&#8217;d her head; but soon oppress&#8217;d <br />
With shame, reclin&#8217;d it on her nurse&#8217;s breast; <br />
Bath&#8217;d it with tears, and strove to have confess&#8217;d: <br />
Twice she began, and stopp&#8217;d; again she try&#8217;d; <br />
The falt&#8217;ring tongue its office still deny&#8217;d. <br />
At last her veil before her face she spread, <br />
And drew a long preluding sigh, and said, <br />
O happy mother, in thy marriage-bed! <br />
Then groan&#8217;d, and ceas&#8217;d. The good old woman shook, <br />
Stiff were her eyes, and ghastly was her look: <br />
Her hoary hair upright with horror stood, <br />
Made (to her grief) more knowing than she wou&#8217;d. <br />
Much she reproach&#8217;d, and many things she said, <br />
To cure the madness of th&#8217; unhappy maid, <br />
In vain: for Myrrha stood convict of ill; <br />
Her reason vanquish&#8217;d, but unchang&#8217;d her will: <br />
Perverse of mind, unable to reply; <br />
She stood resolv&#8217;d, or to possess, or die. <br />
At length the fondness of a nurse prevail&#8217;d <br />
Against her better sense, and virtue fail&#8217;d: <br />
Enjoy, my child, since such is thy desire, <br />
Thy love, she said; she durst not say, thy sire: <br />
Live, though unhappy, live on any terms; <br />
Then with a second oath her faith confirms.</p>
<p>The solemn feast of Ceres now was near, <br />
When long white linnen stoles the matrons wear; <br />
Rank&#8217;d in procession walk the pious train, <br />
Off&#8217;ring first-fruits, and spikes of yellow grain: <br />
For nine long nights the nuptial-bed they shun, <br />
And sanctifying harvest, lie alone.</p>
<p>Mix&#8217;d with the crowd, the queen forsook her lord, <br />
And Ceres&#8217; pow&#8217;r with secret rites ador&#8217;d: <br />
The royal couch, now vacant for a time, <br />
The crafty crone, officious in her crime, <br />
The first occasion took: the king she found <br />
Easie with wine, and deep in pleasures drown&#8217;d, <br />
Prepar&#8217;d for love: the beldame blew the flame, <br />
Confess&#8217;d the passion, but conceal&#8217;d the name. <br />
Her form she prais&#8217;d; the monarch ask&#8217;d her years; <br />
And she reply&#8217;d, The same thy Myrrha bears. <br />
Wine, and commended beauty fir&#8217;d his thought; <br />
Impatient, he commands her to be brought. <br />
Pleas&#8217;d with her charge perform&#8217;d, she hies her home, <br />
And gratulates the nymph, the task was overcome. <br />
Myrrha was joy&#8217;d the welcome news to hear; <br />
But clog&#8217;d with guilt, the joy was unsincere: <br />
So various, so discordant is the mind, <br />
That in our will a diff&#8217;rent will we find. <br />
Ill she presag&#8217;d, and yet pursu&#8217;d her lust; <br />
For guilty pleasures give a double gust.</p>
<p>&#8216;Twas depth of night: Arctophylax had driv&#8217;n <br />
His lazy wain half round the northern Heav&#8217;n, <br />
When Myrrha hasten&#8217;d to the crime desir&#8217;d: <br />
The moon beheld her first, and first retir&#8217;d: <br />
The stars amaz&#8217;d, ran backward from the sight, <br />
And (shrunk within their sockets) lost their light. <br />
Icarius first withdraws his holy flame: <br />
The virgin sign, in Heav&#8217;n the second name, <br />
Slides down the belt, and from her station flies, <br />
And night with sable clouds involves the skies. <br />
Bold Myrrha still pursues her black intent; <br />
She stumbled thrice (an omen of th&#8217; event); <br />
Thrice shriek&#8217;d the fun&#8217;ral owl, yet on she went, <br />
Secure of shame, because secure of sight; <br />
Ev&#8217;n bashful sins are impudent by night. <br />
Link&#8217;d hand in hand, th&#8217; accomplice, and the dame, <br />
Their way exploring, to the chamber came: <br />
The door was ope; they blindly grope their way, <br />
Where dark in bed th&#8217; expecting monarch lay. <br />
Thus far her courage held, but here forsakes; <br />
Her faint knees knock at ev&#8217;ry step she makes. <br />
The nearer to her crime, the more within <br />
She feels remorse, and horror of her sin; <br />
Repents too late her criminal desire, <br />
And wishes, that unknown she could retire. <br />
Her lingring thus, the nurse (who fear&#8217;d delay <br />
The fatal secret might at length betray) <br />
Pull&#8217;d forward, to compleat the work begun, <br />
And said to Cinyras, Receive thy own. <br />
Thus saying, she deliver&#8217;d kind to kind, <br />
Accurs&#8217;d, and their devoted bodies join&#8217;d. <br />
The sire, unknowing of the crime, admits <br />
His bowels, and prophanes the hallow&#8217;d sheets; <br />
He found she trembled, but believ&#8217;d she strove <br />
With maiden modesty against her love, <br />
And sought with flatt&#8217;ring words vain fancies to remove. <br />
Perhaps he said, My daughter, cease thy fears <br />
(Because the title suited with her years); <br />
And, Father, she might whisper him again, <br />
That names might not be wanting to the sin.</p>
<p>Full of her sire, she left th&#8217; incestuous bed, <br />
And carry&#8217;d in her womb the crime she bred. <br />
Another, and another night she came; <br />
For frequent sin had left no sense of shame: <br />
&#8216;Till Cinyras desir&#8217;d to see her face, <br />
Whose body he had held in close embrace, <br />
And brought a taper; the revealer, light, <br />
Expos&#8217;d both crime, and criminal to sight. <br />
Grief, rage, amazement, could no speech afford, <br />
But from the sheath he drew th&#8217; avenging sword: <br />
The guilty fled: the benefit of night, <br />
That favour&#8217;d first the sin, secur&#8217;d the flight. <br />
Long wand&#8217;ring thro&#8217; the spacious fields, she bent <br />
Her voyage to th&#8217; Arabian continent; <br />
Then pass&#8217;d the region which Panchaea join&#8217;d, <br />
And flying, left the palmy plains behind. <br />
Nine times the moon had mew&#8217;d her horns; at length <br />
With travel weary, unsupply&#8217;d with strength, <br />
And with the burden of her womb oppress&#8217;d, <br />
Sabaean fields afford her needful rest: <br />
There, loathing life, and yet of death afraid, <br />
In anguish of her spirit, thus she pray&#8217;d: <br />
Ye Pow&#8217;rs, if any so propitious are <br />
T&#8217; accept my penitence, and hear my pray&#8217;r; <br />
Your judgments, I confess, are justly sent; <br />
Great sins deserve as great a punishment: <br />
Yet since my life the living will profane, <br />
And since my death the happy dead will stain, <br />
A middle state your mercy may bestow, <br />
Betwixt the realms above, and those below: <br />
Some other form to wretched Myrrha give, <br />
Nor let her wholly die, nor wholly live.</p>
<p>The pray&#8217;rs of penitents are never vain; <br />
At least she did her last request obtain: <br />
For while she spoke, the ground began to rise, <br />
And gather&#8217;d round her feet, her legs, and thighs; <br />
Her toes in roots descend, and spreading wide, <br />
A firm foundation for the trunk provide: <br />
Her solid bones convert to solid wood, <br />
To pith her marrow, and to sap her blood: <br />
Her arms are boughs, her fingers change their kind, <br />
Her tender skin is harden&#8217;d into rind. <br />
And now the rising tree her womb invests, <br />
Now shooting upwards still, invades her breasts, <br />
And shades the neck; when weary with delay, <br />
She sunk her head within, and met it half the way. <br />
And tho&#8217; with outward shape she lost her sense, <br />
With bitter tears she wept her last offence; <br />
And still she weeps, nor sheds her tears in vain; <br />
For still the precious drops her name retain. <br />
Mean-time the mis-begotten infant grows, <br />
And ripe for birth, distends with deadly throes <br />
The swelling rind, with unavailing strife, <br />
To leave the wooden womb, and pushes into life. <br />
The mother-tree, as if oppress&#8217;d with pain, <br />
Writhes here, and there, to break the bark, in vain; <br />
And, like a lab&#8217;ring woman, wou&#8217;d have pray&#8217;d, <br />
But wants a voice to call Lucina&#8217;s aid: <br />
The bending bole sends out a hollow sound, <br />
And trickling tears fall thicker on the ground. <br />
The mild Lucina came uncall&#8217;d, and stood <br />
Beside the struggling boughs, and heard the groaning wood; <br />
Then reach&#8217;d her midwife-hand to speed the throes, <br />
And spoke the pow&#8217;rful spells, that babes to birth disclose. <br />
The bark divides, the living load to free, <br />
And safe delivers the convulsive tree. <br />
The ready nymphs receive the crying child, <br />
And wash him in the tears the parent plant distill&#8217;d. <br />
They swath&#8217;d him with their scarfs; beneath him spread <br />
The ground with herbs; with roses rais&#8217;d his head. <br />
The lovely babe was born with ev&#8217;ry grace, <br />
Ev&#8217;n envy must have prais&#8217;d so fair a face: <br />
Such was his form, as painters when they show <br />
Their utmost art, on naked loves bestow: <br />
And that their arms no diff&#8217;rence might betray, <br />
Give him a bow, or his from Cupid take away. <br />
Time glides along with undiscover&#8217;d haste, <br />
The future but a length behind the past; <br />
So swift are years. The babe, whom just before <br />
His grandsire got, and whom his sister bore; <br />
The drop, the thing, which late the tree inclos&#8217;d, <br />
And late the yawning bark to life expos&#8217;d; <br />
A babe, a boy, a beauteous youth appears, <br />
And lovelier than himself at riper years. <br />
Now to the queen of love he gave desires, <br />
And, with her pains, reveng&#8217;d his mother&#8217;s fires.</p>
<p>The Story of Venus and Adonis</p>
<p>For Cytherea&#8217;s lips while Cupid prest, <br />
He with a heedless arrow raz&#8217;d her breast, <br />
The Goddess felt it, and with fury stung, <br />
The wanton mischief from her bosom flung: <br />
Yet thought at first the danger slight, but found <br />
The dart too faithful, and too deep the wound. <br />
Fir&#8217;d with a mortal beauty, she disdains <br />
To haunt th&#8217; Idalian mount, or Phrygian plains. <br />
She seeks not Cnidos, nor her Paphian shrines, <br />
Nor Amathus, that teems with brazen mines: <br />
Ev&#8217;n Heav&#8217;n itself with all its sweets unsought, <br />
Adonis far a sweeter Heav&#8217;n is thought. <br />
On him she hangs, and fonds with ev&#8217;ry art, <br />
And never, never knows from him to part. <br />
She, whose soft limbs had only been display&#8217;d <br />
On rosie beds beneath the myrtle shade, <br />
Whose pleasing care was to improve each grace, <br />
And add more charms to an unrival&#8217;d face, <br />
Now buskin&#8217;d, like the virgin huntress, goes <br />
Thro&#8217; woods, and pathless wilds, and mountain-snows <br />
With her own tuneful voice she joys to cheer <br />
The panting hounds, that chace the flying deer. <br />
She runs the labyrinth of fearful hares, <br />
But fearless beasts, and dang&#8217;rous prey forbears, <br />
Hunts not the grinning wolf, or foamy boar, <br />
And trembles at the lion&#8217;s hungry roar. <br />
Thee too, Adonis, with a lover&#8217;s care <br />
She warns, if warn&#8217;d thou wou&#8217;dst avoid the snare, <br />
To furious animals advance not nigh, <br />
Fly those that follow, follow those that fly; <br />
&#8216;Tis chance alone must the survivors save, <br />
Whene&#8217;er brave spirits will attempt the brave. <br />
O! lovely youth! in harmless sports delight; <br />
Provoke not beasts, which, arm&#8217;d by Nature, fight. <br />
For me, if not thy self, vouchsafe to fear; <br />
Let not thy thirst of glory cost me dear. <br />
Boars know not bow to spare a blooming age; <br />
No sparkling eyes can sooth the lion&#8217;s rage. <br />
Not all thy charms a savage breast can move, <br />
Which have so deeply touch&#8217;d the queen of love. <br />
When bristled boars from beaten thickets spring, <br />
In grinded tusks a thunderbolt they bring. <br />
The daring hunters lions rouz&#8217;d devour, <br />
Vast is their fury, and as vast their pow&#8217;r: <br />
Curst be their tawny race! If thou would&#8217;st hear <br />
What kindled thus my hate, then lend an ear: <br />
The wond&#8217;rous tale I will to thee unfold, <br />
How the fell monsters rose from crimes of old. <br />
But by long toils I faint: see! wide-display&#8217;d, <br />
A grateful poplar courts us with a shade. <br />
The grassy turf, beneath, so verdant shows, <br />
We may secure delightfully repose. <br />
With her Adonis here be Venus blest; <br />
And swift at once the grass and him she prest. <br />
Then sweetly smiling, with a raptur&#8217;d mind, <br />
On his lov&#8217;d bosom she her head reclin&#8217;d, <br />
And thus began; but mindful still of bliss, <br />
Seal&#8217;d the soft accents with a softer kiss.</p>
<p>Perhaps thou may&#8217;st have heard a virgin&#8217;s name, <br />
Who still in swiftness swiftest youths o&#8217;ercame. <br />
Wondrous! that female weakness should outdo <br />
A manly strength; the wonder yet is true. <br />
&#8216;Twas doubtful, if her triumphs in the field <br />
Did to her form&#8217;s triumphant glories yield; <br />
Whether her face could with more ease decoy <br />
A crowd of lovers, or her feet destroy. <br />
For once Apollo she implor&#8217;d to show <br />
If courteous Fates a consort would allow: <br />
A consort brings thy ruin, he reply&#8217;d; <br />
O! learn to want the pleasures of a bride! <br />
Nor shalt thou want them to thy wretched cost, <br />
And Atalanta living shall be lost. <br />
With such a rueful Fate th&#8217; affrighted maid <br />
Sought green recesses in the wood-land glade. <br />
Nor sighing suiters her resolves could move, <br />
She bad them show their speed, to show their love. <br />
He only, who could conquer in the race, <br />
Might hope the conquer&#8217;d virgin to embrace; <br />
While he, whose tardy feet had lagg&#8217;d behind, <br />
Was doom&#8217;d the sad reward of death to find. <br />
Tho&#8217; great the prize, yet rigid the decree, <br />
But blind with beauty, who can rigour see? <br />
Ev&#8217;n on these laws the fair they rashly sought, <br />
And danger in excess of love forgot.</p>
<p>There sat Hippomenes, prepar&#8217;d to blame <br />
In lovers such extravagance of flame. <br />
And must, he said, the blessing of a wife <br />
Be dearly purchas&#8217;d by a risk of life? <br />
But when he saw the wonders of her face, <br />
And her limbs naked, springing to the race, <br />
Her limbs, as exquisitely turn&#8217;d, as mine, <br />
Or if a woman thou, might vie with thine, <br />
With lifted hands, he cry&#8217;d, forgive the tongue <br />
Which durst, ye youths, your well-tim&#8217;d courage wrong. <br />
I knew not that the nymph, for whom you strove, <br />
Deserv&#8217;d th&#8217; unbounded transports of your love. <br />
He saw, admir&#8217;d, and thus her spotless frame <br />
He prais&#8217;d, and praising, kindled his own flame. <br />
A rival now to all the youths who run, <br />
Envious, he fears they should not be undone. <br />
But why (reflects he) idly thus is shown <br />
The fate of others, yet untry&#8217;d my own? <br />
The coward must not on love&#8217;s aid depend; <br />
The God was ever to the bold a friend. <br />
Mean-time the virgin flies, or seems to fly, <br />
Swift as a Scythian arrow cleaves the sky: <br />
Still more and more the youth her charms admires. <br />
The race itself t&#8217; exalt her charms conspires. <br />
The golden pinions, which her feet adorn, <br />
In wanton flutt&#8217;rings by the winds are born. <br />
Down from her head, the long, fair tresses flow, <br />
And sport with lovely negligence below. <br />
The waving ribbands, which her buskins tie, <br />
Her snowy skin with waving purple die; <br />
As crimson veils in palaces display&#8217;d, <br />
To the white marble lend a blushing shade. <br />
Nor long he gaz&#8217;d, yet while he gaz&#8217;d, she gain&#8217;d <br />
The goal, and the victorious wreath obtain&#8217;d. <br />
The vanquish&#8217;d sigh, and, as the law decreed, <br />
Pay the dire forfeit, and prepare to bleed.</p>
<p>Then rose Hippomenes, not yet afraid, <br />
And fix&#8217;d his eyes full on the beauteous maid. <br />
Where is (he cry&#8217;d) the mighty conquest won, <br />
To distance those, who want the nerves to run? <br />
Here prove superior strength, nor shall it be <br />
Thy loss of glory, if excell&#8217;d by me. <br />
High my descent, near Neptune I aspire, <br />
For Neptune was grand-parent to my sire. <br />
From that great God the fourth my self I trace, <br />
Nor sink my virtues yet beneath my race. <br />
Thou from Hippomenes, o&#8217;ercome, may&#8217;st claim <br />
An envy&#8217;d triumph, and a deathless fame.</p>
<p>While thus the youth the virgin pow&#8217;r defies, <br />
Silent she views him still with softer eyes. <br />
Thoughts in her breast a doubtful strife begin, <br />
If &#8217;tis not happier now to lose, than win. <br />
What God, a foe to beauty, would destroy <br />
The promis&#8217;d ripeness of this blooming boy? <br />
With his life&#8217;s danger does he seek my bed? <br />
Scarce am I half so greatly worth, she said. <br />
Nor has his beauty mov&#8217;d my breast to love, <br />
And yet, I own, such beauty well might move: <br />
&#8216;Tis not his charms, &#8217;tis pity would engage <br />
My soul to spare the greenness of his age. <br />
What, that heroick conrage fires his breast, <br />
And shines thro&#8217; brave disdain of Fate confest? <br />
What, that his patronage by close degrees <br />
Springs from th&#8217; imperial ruler of the seas? <br />
Then add the love, which bids him undertake <br />
The race, and dare to perish for my sake. <br />
Of bloody nuptials, heedless youth, beware! <br />
Fly, timely fly from a too barb&#8217;rous fair. <br />
At pleasure chuse; thy love will be repaid <br />
By a less foolish, and more beauteous maid. <br />
But why this tenderness, before unknown? <br />
Why beats, and pants my breast for him alone? <br />
His eyes have seen his num&#8217;rous rivals yield; <br />
Let him too share the rigour of the field, <br />
Since, by their fates untaught, his own he courts, <br />
And thus with ruin insolently sports. <br />
Yet for what crime shall he his death receive? <br />
Is it a crime with me to wish to live? <br />
Shall his kind passion his destruction prove? <br />
Is this the fatal recompence of love? <br />
So fair a youth, destroy&#8217;d, would conquest shame, <br />
Aud nymphs eternally detest my fame. <br />
Still why should nymphs my guiltless fame upbraid? <br />
Did I the fond adventurer persuade? <br />
Alas! I wish thou would&#8217;st the course decline, <br />
Or that my swiftness was excell&#8217;d by thine. <br />
See! what a virgin&#8217;s bloom adorns the boy! <br />
Why wilt thou run, and why thy self destroy? <br />
Hippomenes! O that I ne&#8217;er had been <br />
By those bright eyes unfortunately seen! <br />
Ah! tempt not thus a swift, untimely Fate; <br />
Thy life is worthy of the longest date. <br />
Were I less wretched, did the galling chain <br />
Of rigid Gods not my free choice restrain, <br />
By thee alone I could with joy be led <br />
To taste the raptures of a nuptial bed.</p>
<p>Thus she disclos&#8217;d the woman&#8217;s secret heart, <br />
Young, innocent, and new to Cupid&#8217;s dart. <br />
Her thoughts, her words, her actions wildly rove, <br />
With love she burns, yet knows not that &#8217;tis love.</p>
<p>Her royal sire now with the murm&#8217;ring crowd <br />
Demands the race impatiently aloud. <br />
Hippomenes then with true fervour pray&#8217;d, <br />
My bold attempt let Venus kindly aid. <br />
By her sweet pow&#8217;r I felt this am&#8217;rous fire, <br />
Still may she succour, whom she did inspire. <br />
A soft, unenvious wind, with speedy care, <br />
Wafted to Heav&#8217;n the lover&#8217;s tender pray&#8217;r. <br />
Pity, I own, soon gain&#8217;d the wish&#8217;d consent, <br />
And all th&#8217; assistance he implor&#8217;d I lent. <br />
The Cyprian lands, tho&#8217; rich, in richness yield <br />
To that, surnam&#8217;d the Tamasenian field. <br />
That field of old was added to my shrine, <br />
And its choice products consecrated mine. <br />
A tree there stands, full glorious to behold, <br />
Gold are the leafs, the crackling branches gold. <br />
It chanc&#8217;d, three apples in my hand I bore, <br />
Which newly from the tree I sportive tore; <br />
Seen by the youth alone, to him I brought <br />
The fruit, and when, and how to use it, taught. <br />
The signal sounding by the king&#8217;s command, <br />
Both start at once, and sweep th&#8217; imprinted sand. <br />
So swiftly mov&#8217;d their feet, they might with ease, <br />
Scarce moisten&#8217;d, skim along the glassy seas; <br />
Or with a wondrous levity be born <br />
O&#8217;er yellow harvests of unbending corn. <br />
Now fav&#8217;ring peals resound from ev&#8217;ry part, <br />
Spirit the youth, and fire his fainting heart. <br />
Hippomenes! (they cry&#8217;d) thy life preserve, <br />
Intensely labour, and stretch ev&#8217;ry nerve. <br />
Base fear alone can baffle thy design, <br />
Shoot boldly onward, and the goal is thine. <br />
&#8216;Tis doubtful whether shouts, like these, convey&#8217;d <br />
More pleasures to the youth, or to the maid. <br />
When a long distance oft she could have gain&#8217;d, <br />
She check&#8217;d her swiftness, and her feet restrain&#8217;d: <br />
She sigh&#8217;d, and dwelt, and languish&#8217;d on his face, <br />
Then with unwilling speed pursu&#8217;d the race. <br />
O&#8217;er-spent with heat, his breath he faintly drew, <br />
Parch&#8217;d was his mouth, nor yet the goal in view, <br />
And the first apple on the plain he threw. <br />
The nymph stop&#8217;d sudden at th&#8217; unusual sight, <br />
Struck with the fruit so beautifully bright. <br />
Aside she starts, the wonder to behold, <br />
And eager stoops to catch the rouling gold. <br />
Th&#8217; observant youth past by, and scour&#8217;d along, <br />
While peals of joy rung from th&#8217; applauding throng. <br />
Unkindly she corrects the short delay, <br />
And to redeem the time fleets swift away, <br />
Swift, as the lightning, or the northern wind, <br />
And far she leaves the panting youth behind. <br />
Again he strives the flying nymph to hold <br />
With the temptation of the second gold: <br />
The bright temptation fruitlessly was tost, <br />
So soon, alas! she won the distance lost. <br />
Now but a little interval of space <br />
Remain&#8217;d for the decision of the race. <br />
Fair author of the precious gift, he said, <br />
Be thou, O Goddess, author of my aid! <br />
Then of the shining fruit the last he drew, <br />
And with his full-collected vigour threw: <br />
The virgin still the longer to detain, <br />
Threw not directly, but a-cross the plain. <br />
She seem&#8217;d a-while perplex&#8217;d in dubious thought, <br />
If the far-distant apple should be sought: <br />
I lur&#8217;d her backward mind to seize the bait, <br />
And to the massie gold gave double weight. <br />
My favour to my votary was show&#8217;d, <br />
Her speed I lessen&#8217;d, and encreas&#8217;d her load. <br />
But lest, tho&#8217; long, the rapid race be run, <br />
Before my longer, tedious tale is done, <br />
The youth the goal, and so the virgin won.</p>
<p>Might I, Adonis, now not hope to see <br />
His grateful thanks pour&#8217;d out for victory? <br />
His pious incense on my altars laid? <br />
But he nor grateful thanks, nor incense paid. <br />
Enrag&#8217;d I vow&#8217;d, that with the youth the fair, <br />
For his contempt, should my keen vengeance share; <br />
That future lovers might my pow&#8217;r revere, <br />
And, from their sad examples, learn to fear. <br />
The silent fanes, the sanctify&#8217;d abodes, <br />
Of Cybele, great mother of the Gods, <br />
Rais&#8217;d by Echion in a lonely wood, <br />
And full of brown, religious horror stood. <br />
By a long painful journey faint, they chose! <br />
Their weary limbs here secret to repose. <br />
But soon my pow&#8217;r inflam&#8217;d the lustful boy, <br />
Careless of rest he sought untimely joy. <br />
A hallow&#8217;d gloomy cave, with moss o&#8217;er-grown, <br />
The temple join&#8217;d, of native pumice-stone, <br />
Where antique images by priests were kept. <br />
And wooden deities securely slept. <br />
Thither the rash Hippomenes retires, <br />
And gives a loose to all his wild desires, <br />
And the chaste cell pollutes with wanton fires. <br />
The sacred statues trembled with surprize, <br />
The tow&#8217;ry Goddess, blushing, veil&#8217;d her eyes; <br />
And the lewd pair to Stygian sounds had sent, <br />
But unrevengeful seem&#8217;d that punishment, <br />
A heavier doom such black prophaneness draws, <br />
Their taper figures turn to crooked paws. <br />
No more their necks the smoothness can retain, <br />
Now cover&#8217;d sudden with a yellow mane. <br />
Arms change to legs: each finds the hard&#8217;ning breast <br />
Of rage unknown, and wond&#8217;rous strength possest. <br />
Their alter&#8217;d looks with fury grim appear, <br />
And on the ground their brushing tails they hear. <br />
They haunt the woods: their voices, which before <br />
Were musically sweet, now hoarsly roar. <br />
Hence lions, dreadful to the lab&#8217;ring swains, <br />
Are tam&#8217;d by Cybele, and curb&#8217;d with reins, <br />
And humbly draw her car along the plains. <br />
But thou, Adonis, my delightful care, <br />
Of these, and beasts, as fierce as these, beware! <br />
The savage, which not shuns thee, timely shun, <br />
For by rash prowess should&#8217;st thou be undone, <br />
A double ruin is contain&#8217;d in one. <br />
Thus cautious Venus school&#8217;d her fav&#8217;rite boy; <br />
But youthful heat all cautions will destroy. <br />
His sprightly soul beyond grave counsels flies, <br />
While with yok&#8217;d swans the Goddess cuts the skies. <br />
His faithful hounds, led by the tainted wind, <br />
Lodg&#8217;d in thick coverts chanc&#8217;d a boar to find. <br />
The callow hero show&#8217;d a manly heart, <br />
And pierc&#8217;d the savage with a side-long dart. <br />
The flying savage, wounded, turn&#8217;d again, <br />
Wrench&#8217;d out the gory dart, and foam&#8217;d with pain. <br />
The trembling boy by flight his safety sought, <br />
And now recall&#8217;d the lore, which Venus taught; <br />
But now too late to fly the boar he strove, <br />
Who in the groin his tusks impetuous drove, <br />
On the discolour&#8217;d grass Adonis lay, <br />
The monster trampling o&#8217;er his beauteous prey.</p>
<p>Fair Cytherea, Cyprus scarce in view, <br />
Heard from afar his groans, and own&#8217;d them true, <br />
And turn&#8217;d her snowy swans, and backward flew. <br />
But as she saw him gasp his latest breath, <br />
And quiv&#8217;ring agonize in pangs of death, <br />
Down with swift flight she plung&#8217;d, nor rage forbore, <br />
At once her garments, and her hair she tore. <br />
With cruel blows she beat her guiltless breast, <br />
The Fates upbraided, and her love confest. <br />
Nor shall they yet (she cry&#8217;d) the whole devour <br />
With uncontroul&#8217;d, inexorable pow&#8217;r: <br />
For thee, lost youth, my tears, and restless pain <br />
Shall in immortal monuments remain, <br />
With solemn pomp in annual rites return&#8217;d, <br />
Be thou for ever, my Adonis, mourn&#8217;d, <br />
Could Pluto&#8217;s queen with jealous fury storm, <br />
And Menthe to a fragrant herb transform? <br />
Yet dares not Venus with a change surprise, <br />
And in a flow&#8217;r bid her fall&#8217;n heroe rise? <br />
Then on the blood sweet nectar she bestows, <br />
The scented blood in little bubbles rose: <br />
Little as rainy drops, which flutt&#8217;ring fly, <br />
Born by the winds, along a low&#8217;ring sky. <br />
Short time ensu&#8217;d, &#8217;till where the blood was shed, <br />
A flow&#8217;r began to rear its purple head: <br />
Such, as on Punick apples is reveal&#8217;d, <br />
Or in the filmy rind but half conceal&#8217;d. <br />
Still here the Fate of lovely forms we see, <br />
So sudden fades the sweet Anemonie. <br />
The feeble stems, to stormy blasts a prey, <br />
Their sickly beauties droop, and pine away. <br />
The winds forbid the flow&#8217;rs to flourish long, <br />
Which owe to winds their names in Grecian song. </p>
