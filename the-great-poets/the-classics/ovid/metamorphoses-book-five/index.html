				<p>The Story of Perseus continu&#8217;d</p>
<p>While Perseus entertain&#8217;d with this report <br />
His father Cepheus, and the list&#8217;ning court, <br />
Within the palace walls was heard aloud <br />
The roaring noise of some unruly crowd; <br />
Not like the songs which chearful friends prepare <br />
For nuptial days, but sounds that threaten&#8217;d war; <br />
And all the pleasures of this happy feast, <br />
To tumult turn&#8217;d, in wild disorder ceas&#8217;d: <br />
So, when the sea is calm, we often find <br />
A storm rais&#8217;d sudden by some furious wind. <br />
Chief in the riot Phineus first appear&#8217;d, <br />
The rash ringleader of this boist&#8217;rous herd, <br />
And brandishing his brazen-pointed lance, <br />
Behold, he said, an injur&#8217;d man advance, <br />
Stung with resentment for his ravish&#8217;d wife, <br />
Nor shall thy wings, o Perseus, save thy life; <br />
Nor Jove himself; tho&#8217; we&#8217;ve been often told <br />
Who got thee in the form of tempting gold. <br />
His lance was aim&#8217;d, when Cepheus ran, and said, <br />
Hold, brother, hold; what brutal rage has made <br />
Your frantick mind so black a crime conceive? <br />
Are these the thanks that you to Perseus give? <br />
This the reward that to his worth you pay, <br />
Whose timely valour sav&#8217;d Andromeda? <br />
Nor was it he, if you would reason right, <br />
That forc&#8217;d her from you, but the jealous spight <br />
Of envious Nereids, and Jove&#8217;s high decree; <br />
And that devouring monster of the sea, <br />
That ready with his jaws wide gaping stood <br />
To eat my child, the fairest of my blood. <br />
You lost her then, when she seem&#8217;d past relief, <br />
And wish&#8217;d perhaps her death, to ease your grief <br />
With my afflictions: not content to view <br />
Andromeda in chains, unhelp&#8217;d by you, <br />
Her spouse, and uncle; will you grieve that he <br />
Expos&#8217;d his life the dying maid to free? <br />
And shall you claim his merit? Had you thought <br />
Her charms so great, you shou&#8217;d have bravely sought <br />
That blessing on the rocks, where fix&#8217;d she lay: <br />
But now let Perseus bear his prize away, <br />
By service gain&#8217;d, by promis&#8217;d faith possess&#8217;d; <br />
To him I owe it, that my age is bless&#8217;d <br />
Still with a child: Nor think that I prefer <br />
Perseus to thee, but to the loss of her.</p>
<p>Phineus on him, and Perseus, roul&#8217;d about <br />
His eyes in silent rage, and seem&#8217;d to doubt <br />
Which to destroy; &#8217;till, resolute at length, <br />
He threw his spear with the redoubled strength <br />
His fury gave him, and at Perseus struck; <br />
But missing Perseus, in his seat it stuck. <br />
Who, springing nimbly up, return&#8217;d the dart, <br />
And almost plung&#8217;d it in his rival&#8217;s heart; <br />
But he for safety to the altar ran, <br />
Unfit protection for so vile a man; <br />
Yet was the stroke not vain, as Rhaetus found, <br />
Who in his brow receiv&#8217;d a mortal wound; <br />
Headlong he tumbled, when his skull was broke, <br />
From which his friends the fatal weapon took, <br />
While he lay trembling, and his gushing blood <br />
In crimson streams around the table flow&#8217;d.</p>
<p>But this provok&#8217;d th&#8217; unruly rabble worse, <br />
They flung their darts, and some in loud discourse <br />
To death young Perseus, and the monarch doom; <br />
But Cepheus left before the guilty room, <br />
With grief appealing to the Gods above, <br />
Who laws of hospitality approve, <br />
Who faith protect, and succour injur&#8217;d right, <br />
That he was guiltless of this barb&#8217;rous fight.</p>
<p>Pallas her brother Perseus close attends, <br />
And with her ample shield from harm defends, <br />
Raising a sprightly courage in his heart: <br />
But Indian Athis took the weaker part, <br />
Born in the chrystal grottoes of the sea, <br />
Limnate&#8217;s son, a fenny nymph, and she <br />
Daughter of Ganges; graceful was his mein, <br />
His person lovely, and his age sixteen. <br />
His habit made his native beauty more; <br />
A purple mantle fring&#8217;d with gold he wore; <br />
His neck well-turn&#8217;d with golden chains was grac&#8217;d, <br />
His hair with myrrh perfum&#8217;d, was nicely dress&#8217;d. <br />
Tho&#8217; with just aim he cou&#8217;d the javelin throw, <br />
Yet with more skill he drew the bending bow; <br />
And now was drawing it with artful hand, <br />
When Perseus snatching up a flaming brand, <br />
Whirl&#8217;d sudden at his face the burning wood, <br />
Crush&#8217;d his eyes in, and quench&#8217;d the fire with blood; <br />
Thro&#8217; the soft skin the splinter&#8217;d bones appear, <br />
And spoil&#8217;d the face that lately was so fair.</p>
<p>When Lycabas his Athis thus beheld, <br />
How was his heart with friendly horror fill&#8217;d! <br />
A youth so noble, to his soul so dear, <br />
To see his shapeless look, his dying groans to hear! <br />
He snatch&#8217;d the bow the boy was us&#8217;d to bend, <br />
And cry&#8217;d, With me, false traytor, dare contend; <br />
Boast not a conquest o&#8217;er a child, but try <br />
Thy strength with me, who all thy pow&#8217;rs defy; <br />
Nor think so mean an act a victory. <br />
While yet he spoke he flung the whizzing dart, <br />
Which pierc&#8217;d the plaited robe, but miss&#8217;d his heart: <br />
Perseus defy&#8217;d, upon him fiercely press&#8217;d <br />
With sword, unsheath&#8217;d, and plung&#8217;d it in his breast; <br />
His eyes o&#8217;erwhelm&#8217;d with night, he stumbling falls, <br />
And with his latest breath on Athis calls; <br />
Pleas&#8217;d that so near the lovely youth he lies, <br />
He sinks his head upon his friend, and dies.</p>
<p>Next eager Phorbas, old Methion&#8217;s son, <br />
Came rushing forward with Amphimedon; <br />
When the smooth pavement, slippery made with gore, <br />
Trip&#8217;d up their feet, and flung &#8216;em on the floor; <br />
The sword of Perseus, who by chance was nigh, <br />
Prevents their rise, and where they fall, they lye: <br />
Full in his ribs Amphimedon he smote, <br />
And then stuck fiery Phorbas in the throat. <br />
Eurythus lifting up his ax, the blow <br />
Was thus prevented by his nimble foe; <br />
A golden cup he seizes, high embost, <br />
And at his head the massy goblet tost: <br />
It hits, and from his forehead bruis&#8217;d rebounds, <br />
And blood, and brains he vomits from his wounds; <br />
With his slain fellows on the floor he lies, <br />
And death for ever shuts his swimming eyes. <br />
Then Polydaemon fell, a Goddess-born; <br />
Phlegias, and Elycen with locks unshorn <br />
Next follow&#8217;d; next, the stroke of death he gave <br />
To Clytus, Abanis, and Lycetus brave; <br />
While o&#8217;er unnumber&#8217;d heaps of ghastly dead, <br />
The Argive heroe&#8217;s feet triumphant tread.</p>
<p>But Phineus stands aloof, and dreads to feel <br />
His rival&#8217;s force, and flies his pointed steel: <br />
Yet threw a dart from far; by chance it lights <br />
On Idas, who for neither party fights; <br />
But wounded, sternly thus to Phineus said, <br />
Since of a neuter thou a foe hast made, <br />
This I return thee, drawing from his side <br />
The dart; which, as he strove to fling, he dy&#8217;d. <br />
Odites fell by Clymenus&#8217;s sword, <br />
The Cephen court had not a greater lord. <br />
Hypseus his blade does in Protenor sheath, <br />
But brave Lyncides soon reveng&#8217;d his death. <br />
Here too was old Emathion, one that fear&#8217;d <br />
The Gods, and in the cause of Heav&#8217;n appear&#8217;d, <br />
Who only wishing the success of right, <br />
And, by his age, exempted from the fight, <br />
Both sides alike condemns: This impious war <br />
Cease, cease, he cries; these bloody broils forbear. <br />
This scarce the sage with high concern had said, <br />
When Chromis at a blow struck off his head, <br />
Which dropping, on the royal altar roul&#8217;d, <br />
Still staring on the crowd with aspect bold; <br />
And still it seem&#8217;d their horrid strife to blame, <br />
In life and death, his pious zeal the same; <br />
While clinging to the horns, the trunk expires, <br />
The sever&#8217;d head consumes amidst the fires.</p>
<p>Then Phineus, who from far his javelin threw, <br />
Broteas and Ammon, twins and brothers, slew; <br />
For knotted gauntlets matchless in the field; <br />
But gauntlets must to swords and javelins yield. <br />
Ampycus next, with hallow&#8217;d fillets bound, <br />
As Ceres&#8217; priest, and with a mitre crown&#8217;d, <br />
His spear transfix&#8217;d, and struck him to the ground.</p>
<p>O Iapetides, with pain I tell <br />
How you, sweet lyrist, in the riot fell; <br />
What worse than brutal rage his breast could fill, <br />
Who did thy blood, o bard celestial! spill? <br />
Kindly you press&#8217;d amid the princely throng, <br />
To crown the feast, and give the nuptial song: <br />
Discord abhorr&#8217;d the musick of thy lyre, <br />
Whose notes did gentle peace so well inspire; <br />
Thee, when fierce Pettalus far off espy&#8217;d, <br />
Defenceless with thy harp, he scoffing cry&#8217;d, <br />
Go; to the ghosts thy soothing lessons play; <br />
We loath thy lyre, and scorn thy peaceful lay: <br />
And, as again he fiercely bid him go, <br />
He pierc&#8217;d his temples with a mortal blow. <br />
His harp he held, tho&#8217; sinking on the ground, <br />
Whose strings in death his trembling fingers found <br />
By chance, and tun&#8217;d by chance a dying sound.</p>
<p>With grief Lycormas saw him fall, from far, <br />
And, wresting from the door a massy bar, <br />
Full in his poll lays on a load of knocks, <br />
Which stun him, and he falls like a devoted ox. <br />
Another bar Pelates would have snach&#8217;d, <br />
But Corynthus his motions slily watch&#8217;d; <br />
He darts his weapon from a private stand, <br />
And rivets to the post his veiny hand: <br />
When strait a missive spear transfix&#8217;d his side, <br />
By Abas thrown, and as he hung, he dy&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Melaneus on the prince&#8217;s side was slain; <br />
And Dorylas, who own&#8217;d a fertile plain, <br />
Of Nasamonia&#8217;s fields the wealthy lord, <br />
Whose crowded barns, could scarce contain their board. <br />
A whizzing spear obliquely gave a blow, <br />
Stuck in his groin, and pierc&#8217;d the nerves below; <br />
His foe behld his eyes convulsive roul, <br />
His ebbing veins, and his departing soul; <br />
Then taunting said, Of all thy spacious plain, <br />
This spot thy only property remains. <br />
He left him thus; but had no sooner left, <br />
Than Perseus in revenge his nostrils cleft; <br />
From his friend&#8217;s breast the murd&#8217;ring dart he drew, <br />
And the same weapon at the murderer threw; <br />
His head in halves the darted javelin cut, <br />
And on each side the brain came issuing out.</p>
<p>Fortune his friend, in deaths around he deals, <br />
And this his lance, and that his faulchion feels: <br />
Now Clytius dies; and by a diff&#8217;rent wound, <br />
The twin, his brother Clanis, bites the ground. <br />
In his rent jaw the bearded weapon sticks, <br />
And the steel&#8217;d dart does Clytius&#8217; thigh transfix. <br />
With these Mendesian Celadon he slew: <br />
And Astreus next, whose mother was a Jew, <br />
His sire uncertain: then by Perseus fell <br />
Aethion, who cou&#8217;d things to come foretell; <br />
But now he knows not whence the javelin flies <br />
That wounds his breast, nor by whose arm he dies.</p>
<p>The squire to Phineus next his valour try&#8217;d, <br />
And fierce Agyrtes stain&#8217;d with paricide.</p>
<p>As these are slain, fresh numbers still appear, <br />
And wage with Perseus an unequal war; <br />
To rob him of his right, the maid he won, <br />
By honour, promise, and desert his own. <br />
With him, the father of the beauteous bride, <br />
The mother, and the frighted virgin side; <br />
With shrieks, and doleful cries they rend the air: <br />
Their shrieks confounded with the din of war, <br />
With dashing arms, and groanings of the slain, <br />
They grieve unpitied, and unheard complain. <br />
The floor with ruddy streams Bellona stains, <br />
And Phineus a new war with double rage maintains.</p>
<p>Perseus begirt, from all around they pour <br />
Their lances on him, a tempestuous show&#8217;r, <br />
Aim&#8217;d all at him; a cloud of darts, and spears, <br />
Or blind his eyes, or whistle round his ears. <br />
Their numbers to resist, against the wall <br />
He guards his back secure, and dares them all. <br />
Here from the left Molpeus renews the fight, <br />
And bold Ethemon presses on the right: <br />
As when a hungry tyger near him hears <br />
Two lowing herds, a-while he both forbears; <br />
Nor can his hopes of this, or that renounce, <br />
So strong he lusts to prey on both at once; <br />
Thus Perseus now with that, or this is loth <br />
To war distinct:, but fain would fall on both. <br />
And first Chaonian Molpeus felt his blow, <br />
And fled, and never after fac&#8217;d his foe; <br />
Then fierce Ethemon, as he turn&#8217;d his back, <br />
Hurried with fury, aiming at his neck, <br />
His brandish&#8217;d sword against the marble struck <br />
With all his might; the brittle weapon broke, <br />
And in his throat the point rebounding stuck. <br />
Too slight the wound for life to issue thence, <br />
And yet too great for battel, or defence; <br />
His arms extended in this piteous state, <br />
For mercy he wou&#8217;d sue, but sues too late; <br />
Perseus has in his bosom plung&#8217;d the sword, <br />
And, ere he speaks, the wound prevents the word.</p>
<p>The crowds encreasing, and his friends distress&#8217;d, <br />
Himself by warring multitudes oppress&#8217;d: <br />
Since thus unequally you fight, &#8217;tis time, <br />
He cry&#8217;d, to punish your presumptuous crime; <br />
Beware, my friends; his friends were soon prepar&#8217;d, <br />
Their sight averting, high the head he rear&#8217;d, <br />
And Gorgon on his foes severely star&#8217;d. <br />
Vain shift! says Thescelus, with aspect bold, <br />
Thee, and thy bugbear monster, I behold <br />
With scorn; he lifts his arm, but ere he threw <br />
The dart, the heroe to a statue grew. <br />
In the same posture still the marble stands, <br />
And holds the warrior&#8217;s weapons in its hands. <br />
Amphyx, whom yet this wonder can&#8217;t alarm, <br />
Heaves at Lyncides&#8217; breast his impious arm; <br />
But, while thus daringly he presses on, <br />
His weapon and his arm are turn&#8217;d to stone. <br />
Next Nileus, he who vainly said he ow&#8217;d <br />
His origin to Nile&#8217;s prolifick flood; <br />
Who on his shield seven silver rivers bore, <br />
His birth to witness by the arms he wore; <br />
Full of his sev&#8217;n-fold father, thus express&#8217;d <br />
His boast to Perseus, and his pride confess&#8217;d: <br />
See whence we sprung; let this thy comfort be <br />
In thy sure death, that thou didst die by me. <br />
While yet he spoke, the dying accents hung <br />
In sounds imperfect on his marble tongue; <br />
Tho&#8217; chang&#8217;d to stone, his lips he seem&#8217;d to stretch, <br />
And thro&#8217; th&#8217; insensate rock wou&#8217;d force a speech.</p>
<p>This Eryx saw, but seeing wou&#8217;d not own; <br />
The mischief by your selves, he cries, is done, <br />
&#8216;Tis your cold courage turns your hearts to stone. <br />
Come, follow me; fall on the stripling boy, <br />
Kill him, and you his magick arms destroy. <br />
Then rushing on, his arm to strike he rear&#8217;d, <br />
And marbled o&#8217;er his varied frame appear&#8217;d.</p>
<p>These for affronting Pallas were chastis&#8217;d, <br />
And justly met the death they had despis&#8217;d. <br />
But brave Aconteus, Perseus&#8217; friend, by chance <br />
Look&#8217;d back, and met the Gorgon&#8217;s fatal glance: <br />
A statue now become, he ghastly stares, <br />
And still the foe to mortal combat dares. <br />
Astyages the living likeness knew, <br />
On the dead stone with vengeful fury flew; <br />
But impotent his rage, the jarring blade <br />
No print upon the solid marble made: <br />
Again, as with redoubled might he struck, <br />
Himself astonish&#8217;d in the quarry stuck.</p>
<p>The vulgar deaths &#8217;twere tedious to rehearse, <br />
And fates below the dignity of verse; <br />
Their safety in their flight two hundred found, <br />
Two hundred, by Medusa&#8217;s head were ston&#8217;d. <br />
Fierce Phineus now repents the wrongful fight, <br />
And views his varied friends, a dreadful sight; <br />
He knows their faces, for their help he sues, <br />
And thinks, not hearing him, that they refuse: <br />
By name he begs their succour, one by one, <br />
Then doubts their life, and feels the friendly stone. <br />
Struck with remorse, and conscious of his pride, <br />
Convict of sin, he turn&#8217;d his eyes aside; <br />
With suppliant mein to Perseus thus he prays, <br />
Hence with the head, as far as winds and seas <br />
Can bear thee; hence, o quit the Cephen shore, <br />
And never curse us with Medusa more, <br />
That horrid head, which stiffens into stone <br />
Those impious men who, daring death, look on. <br />
I warr&#8217;d not with thee out of hate or strife, <br />
My honest cause was to defend my wife, <br />
First pledg&#8217;d to me; what crime cou&#8217;d I suppose, <br />
To arm my friends, and vindicate my spouse? <br />
But vain, too late I see, was our design; <br />
Mine was the title, but the merit thine. <br />
Contending made me guilty, I confess; <br />
But penitence shou&#8217;d make that guilt the less: <br />
&#8216;Twas thine to conquer by Minerva&#8217;s pow&#8217;r; <br />
Favour&#8217;d of Heav&#8217;n, thy mercy I implore; <br />
For life I sue; the rest to thee I yield; <br />
In pity, from my sight remove the shield.</p>
<p>He suing said; nor durst revert his eyes <br />
On the grim head: and Perseus thus replies: <br />
Coward, what is in me to grant, I will, <br />
Nor blood, unworthy of my valour spill: <br />
Fear not to perish by my vengeful sword, <br />
From that secure; &#8217;tis all the Fates afford. <br />
Where I now see thee, thou shalt still be seen, <br />
A lasting monument to please our queen; <br />
There still shall thy betroth&#8217;d behold her spouse, <br />
And find his image in her father&#8217;s house. <br />
This said; where Phineus turn&#8217;d to shun the shield <br />
Full in his face the staring head he held; <br />
As here and there he strove to turn aside, <br />
The wonder wrought, the man was petrify&#8217;d: <br />
All marble was his frame, his humid eyes <br />
Drop&#8217;d tears, which hung upon the stone like ice. <br />
In suppliant posture, with uplifted hands, <br />
And fearful look, the guilty statue stands.</p>
<p>Hence Perseus to his native city hies, <br />
Victorious, and rewarded with his prize. <br />
Conquest, o&#8217;er Praetus the usurper, won, <br />
He re-instates his grandsire in the throne. <br />
Praetus, his brother dispossess&#8217;d by might, <br />
His realm enjoy&#8217;d, and still detain&#8217;d his right: <br />
But Perseus pull&#8217;d the haughty tyrant down, <br />
And to the rightful king restor&#8217;d the throne. <br />
Weak was th&#8217; usurper, as his cause was wrong; <br />
Where Gorgon&#8217;s head appears, what arms are strong? <br />
When Perseus to his host the monster held, <br />
They soon were statues, and their king expell&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Thence, to Seriphus with the head he sails, <br />
Whose prince his story treats as idle tales: <br />
Lord of a little isle, he scorns to seem <br />
Too credulous, but laughs at that, and him. <br />
Yet did he not so much suspect the truth, <br />
As out of pride, or envy, hate the youth. <br />
The Argive prince, at his contempt enrag&#8217;d, <br />
To force his faith by fatal proof engag&#8217;d. <br />
Friends, shut your eyes, he cries; his shield he takes, <br />
And to the king expos&#8217;d Medusa&#8217;s snakes. <br />
The monarch felt the pow&#8217;r he wou&#8217;d not own, <br />
And stood convict of folly in the stone.</p>
<p>Minerva&#8217;s Interview with the Muses</p>
<p>Thus far Minerva was content to rove <br />
With Perseus, offspring of her father Jove: <br />
Now, hid in clouds, Seriphus she forsook; <br />
And to the Theban tow&#8217;rs her journey took. <br />
Cythnos and Gyaros lying to the right, <br />
She pass&#8217;d unheeded in her eager flight; <br />
And chusing first on Helicon to rest, <br />
The virgin Muses in these words address&#8217;d:</p>
<p>Me, the strange tidings of a new-found spring, <br />
Ye learned sisters, to this mountain bring. <br />
If all be true that Fame&#8217;s wide rumours tell, <br />
&#8216;Twas Pegasus discover&#8217;d first your well; <br />
Whose piercing hoof gave the soft earth a blow, <br />
Which broke the surface where these waters flow. <br />
I saw that horse by miracle obtain <br />
Life, from the blood of dire Medusa slain; <br />
And now, this equal prodigy to view, <br />
From distant isles to fam&#8217;d Boeotia flew.</p>
<p>The Muse Urania said, Whatever cause <br />
So great a Goddess to this mansion draws; <br />
Our shades are happy with so bright a guest, <br />
You, Queen, are welcome, and we Muses blest. <br />
What Fame has publish&#8217;d of our spring is true, <br />
Thanks for our spring to Pegasus are due. <br />
Then, with becoming courtesy, she led <br />
The curious stranger to their fountain&#8217;s head; <br />
Who long survey&#8217;d, with wonder, and delight, <br />
Their sacred water, charming to the sight; <br />
Their ancient groves, dark grottos, shady bow&#8217;rs, <br />
And smiling plains adorn&#8217;d with various flow&#8217;rs. <br />
O happy Muses! she with rapture cry&#8217;d, <br />
Who, safe from cares, on this fair hill reside; <br />
Blest in your seat, and free your selves to please <br />
With joys of study, and with glorious ease.</p>
<p>The Fate of Pyreneus</p>
<p>Then one replies: O Goddess, fit to guide <br />
Our humble works, and in our choir preside, <br />
Who sure wou&#8217;d wisely to these fields repair, <br />
To taste our pleasures, and our labours share, <br />
Were not your virtue, and superior mind <br />
To higher arts, and nobler deeds inclin&#8217;d; <br />
Justly you praise our works, and pleasing seat, <br />
Which all might envy in this soft retreat, <br />
Were we secur&#8217;d from dangers, and from harms; <br />
But maids are frighten&#8217;d with the least alarms, <br />
And none are safe in this licentious time; <br />
Still fierce Pyreneus, and his daring crime, <br />
With lasting horror strikes my feeble sight, <br />
Nor is my mind recover&#8217;d from the fright. <br />
With Thracian arms this bold usurper gain&#8217;d <br />
Daulis, and Phocis, where he proudly reign&#8217;d: <br />
It happen&#8217;d once, as thro&#8217; his lands we went, <br />
For the bright temple of Parnassus bent, <br />
He met us there, and in his artful mind <br />
Hiding the faithless action he design&#8217;d, <br />
Confer&#8217;d on us (whom, oh! too well he knew) <br />
All honours that to Goddesses are due. <br />
Stop, stop, ye Muses, &#8217;tis your friend who calls, <br />
The tyrant said; behold the rain that falls <br />
On ev&#8217;ry side, and that ill-boding sky, <br />
Whose lowring face portends more storms are nigh. <br />
Pray make my house your own, and void of fear, <br />
While this bad weather lasts, take shelter here. <br />
Gods have made meaner places their resort, <br />
And, for a cottage, left their shining court.</p>
<p>Oblig&#8217;d to stop, by the united force <br />
Of pouring rains, and complaisant discourse, <br />
His courteous invitation we obey, <br />
And in his hall resolve a-while to stay. <br />
Soon it clear&#8217;d up; the clouds began to fly, <br />
The driving north refin&#8217;d the show&#8217;ry sky; <br />
Then to pursue our journey we began: <br />
But the false traitor to his portal ran, <br />
Stopt our escape, the door securely barr&#8217;d, <br />
And to our honour, violence prepar&#8217;d. <br />
But we, transform&#8217;d to birds, avoid his snare, <br />
On pinions rising in the yielding air.</p>
<p>But he, by lust and indignation fir&#8217;d, <br />
Up to his highest tow&#8217;r with speed retir&#8217;d, <br />
And cries, In vain you from my arms withdrew, <br />
The way you go your lover will pursue. <br />
Then, in a flying posture wildly plac&#8217;d, <br />
And daring from that height himself to cast, <br />
The wretch fell headlong, and the ground bestrew&#8217;d <br />
With broken bones, and stains of guilty blood.</p>
<p>The Story of the Pierides</p>
<p>The Muse yet spoke; when they began to hear <br />
A noise of wings that flutter&#8217;d in the air; <br />
And strait a voice, from some high-spreading bough, <br />
Seem&#8217;d to salute the company below. <br />
The Goddess wonder&#8217;d, and inquir&#8217;d from whence <br />
That tongue was heard, that spoke so plainly sense <br />
(It seem&#8217;d to her a human voice to be, <br />
But prov&#8217;d a bird&#8217;s; for in a shady tree <br />
Nine magpies perch&#8217;d lament their alter&#8217;d state, <br />
And, what they hear, are skilful to repeat).</p>
<p>The sister to the wondring Goddess said, <br />
These, foil&#8217;d by us, by us were thus repaid. <br />
These did Evippe of Paeonia bring <br />
With nine hard labour-pangs to Pella&#8217;s king. <br />
The foolish virgins of their number proud, <br />
And puff&#8217;d with praises of the senseless crowd, <br />
Thro&#8217; all Achaia, and th&#8217; Aemonian plains <br />
Defy&#8217;d us thus, to match their artless strains; <br />
No more, ye Thespian girls, your notes repeat, <br />
Nor with false harmony the vulgar cheat; <br />
In voice or skill, if you with us will vye, <br />
As many we, in voice or skill will try. <br />
Surrender you to us, if we excell, <br />
Fam&#8217;d Aganippe, and Medusa&#8217;s well. <br />
The conquest yours, your prize from us shall be <br />
The Aemathian plains to snowy Paeone; <br />
The nymphs our judges. To dispute the field, <br />
We thought a shame; but greater shame to yield. <br />
On seats of living stone the sisters sit, <br />
And by the rivers swear to judge aright.</p>
<p>The Song of the Pierides</p>
<p>Then rises one of the presumptuous throng, <br />
Steps rudely forth, and first begins the song; <br />
With vain address describes the giants&#8217; wars, <br />
And to the Gods their fabled acts prefers. <br />
She sings, from Earth&#8217;s dark womb how Typhon rose, <br />
And struck with mortal fear his heav&#8217;nly foes. <br />
How the Gods fled to Egypt&#8217;s slimy soil, <br />
And hid their heads beneath the banks of Nile: <br />
How Typhon, from the conquer&#8217;d skies, pursu&#8217;d <br />
Their routed godheads to the sev&#8217;n-mouth&#8217;d flood; <br />
Forc&#8217;d every God, his fury to escape, <br />
Some beastly form to take, or earthly shape. <br />
Jove (so she sung) was chang&#8217;d into a ram, <br />
From whence the horns of Libyan Ammon came. <br />
Bacchus a goat, Apollo was a crow, <br />
Phaebe a cat; die wife of Jove a cow, <br />
Whose hue was whiter than the falling snow. <br />
Mercury to a nasty Ibis turn&#8217;d, <br />
The change obscene, afraid of Typhon, mourn&#8217;d; <br />
While Venus from a fish protection craves, <br />
And once more plunges in her native waves.</p>
<p>She sung, and to her harp her voice apply&#8217;d; <br />
Then us again to match her they defy&#8217;d. <br />
But our poor song, perhaps, for you to hear, <br />
Nor leisure serves, nor is it worth your ear. <br />
That causeless doubt remove, O Muse rehearse, <br />
The Goddess cry&#8217;d, your ever-grateful verse. <br />
Beneath a chequer&#8217;d shade she takes her seat, <br />
And bids the sister her whole song repeat. <br />
The sister thus: Calliope we chose <br />
For the performance. The sweet virgin rose, <br />
With ivy crown&#8217;d she tunes her golden strings, <br />
And to her harp this composition sings.</p>
<p>The Song of the Muses</p>
<p>First Ceres taught the lab&#8217;ring hind to plow <br />
The pregnant Earth, and quickning seed to sow. <br />
She first for Man did wholsome food provide, <br />
And with just laws the wicked world supply&#8217;d: <br />
All good from her deriv&#8217;d, to her belong <br />
The grateful tributes of the Muse&#8217;s song. <br />
Her more than worthy of our verse we deem, <br />
Oh! were our verse more worthy of the theme.</p>
<p>Jove on the giant fair Trinacria hurl&#8217;d, <br />
And with one bolt reveng&#8217;d his starry world. <br />
Beneath her burning hills Tiphaeus lies, <br />
And, strugling always, strives in vain to rise. <br />
Down does Pelorus his right hand suppress <br />
Tow&#8217;rd Latium, on the left Pachyne weighs. <br />
His legs are under Lilybaeum spread, <br />
And Aetna presses hard his horrid head. <br />
On his broad back he there extended lies, <br />
And vomits clouds of ashes to the skies. <br />
Oft lab&#8217;ring with his load, at last he tires, <br />
And spews out in revenge a flood of fires. <br />
Mountains he struggles to o&#8217;erwhelm, and towns; <br />
Earth&#8217;s inmost bowels quake, and Nature groans. <br />
His terrors reach the direful king of Hell; <br />
He fears his throws will to the day reveal <br />
The realms of night, and fright his trembling ghosts.</p>
<p>This to prevent, he quits the Stygian coasts, <br />
In his black carr, by sooty horses drawn, <br />
Fair Sicily he seeks, and dreads the dawn. <br />
Around her plains he casts his eager eyes, <br />
And ev&#8217;ry mountain to the bottom tries. <br />
But when, in all the careful search, he saw <br />
No cause of fear, no ill-suspected flaw; <br />
Secure from harm, and wand&#8217;ring on at will, <br />
Venus beheld him from her flow&#8217;ry hill: <br />
When strait the dame her little Cupid prest <br />
With secret rapture to her snowy breast, <br />
And in these words the flutt&#8217;ring boy addrest.</p>
<p>O thou, my arms, my glory, and my pow&#8217;r, <br />
My son, whom men, and deathless Gods adore; <br />
Bend thy sure bow, whose arrows never miss&#8217;d, <br />
No longer let Hell&#8217;s king thy sway resist; <br />
Take him, while stragling from his dark abodes <br />
He coasts the kingdoms of superior Gods. <br />
If sovereign Jove, if Gods who rule the waves, <br />
And Neptune, who rules them, have been thy slaves; <br />
Shall Hell be free? The tyrant strike, my son, <br />
Enlarge thy mother&#8217;s empire, and thy own. <br />
Let not our Heav&#8217;n be made the mock of Hell, <br />
But Pluto to confess thy pow&#8217;r compel. <br />
Our rule is slighted in our native skies, <br />
See Pallas, see Diana too defies <br />
Thy darts, which Ceres&#8217; daughter wou&#8217;d despise. <br />
She too our empire treats with aukward scorn; <br />
Such insolence no longer&#8217;s to be born. <br />
Revenge our slighted reign, and with thy dart <br />
Transfix the virgin&#8217;s to the uncle&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>She said; and from his quiver strait he drew <br />
A dart that surely wou&#8217;d the business do. <br />
She guides his hand, she makes her touch the test, <br />
And of a thousand arrows chose the best: <br />
No feather better pois&#8217;d, a sharper head <br />
None had, and sooner none, and surer sped. <br />
He bends his bow, he draws it to his ear, <br />
Thro&#8217; Pluto&#8217;s heart it drives, and fixes there.</p>
<p>The Rape of Proserpine</p>
<p>Near Enna&#8217;s walls a spacious lake is spread, <br />
Fam&#8217;d for the sweetly-singing swans it bred; <br />
Pergusa is its name: and never more <br />
Were heard, or sweeter on Cayster&#8217;s shore. <br />
Woods crown the lake; and Phoebus ne&#8217;er invades <br />
The tufted fences, or offends the shades: <br />
Fresh fragrant breezes fan the verdant bow&#8217;rs, <br />
And the moist ground smiles with enamel&#8217;d flow&#8217;rs <br />
The chearful birds their airy carols sing, <br />
And the whole year is one eternal spring.</p>
<p>Here, while young Proserpine, among the maids, <br />
Diverts herself in these delicious shades; <br />
While like a child with busy speed and care <br />
She gathers lillies here, and vi&#8217;lets there; <br />
While first to fill her little lap she strives, <br />
Hell&#8217;s grizly monarch at the shade arrives; <br />
Sees her thus sporting on the flow&#8217;ry green, <br />
And loves the blooming maid, as soon as seen. <br />
His urgent flame impatient of delay, <br />
Swift as his thought he seiz&#8217;d the beauteous prey, <br />
And bore her in his sooty carr away. <br />
The frighted Goddess to her mother cries, <br />
But all in vain, for now far off she flies; <br />
Far she behind her leaves her virgin train; <br />
To them too cries, and cries to them in vain, <br />
And, while with passion she repeats her call, <br />
The vi&#8217;lets from her lap, and lillies fall: <br />
She misses &#8216;em, poor heart! and makes new moan; <br />
Her lillies, ah! are lost, her vi&#8217;lets gone.</p>
<p>O&#8217;er hills, the ravisher, and vallies speeds, <br />
By name encouraging his foamy steeds; <br />
He rattles o&#8217;er their necks the rusty reins, <br />
And ruffles with the stroke their shaggy manes. <br />
O&#8217;er lakes he whirls his flying wheels, and comes <br />
To the Palici breathing sulph&#8217;rous fumes. <br />
And thence to where the Bacchiads of renown <br />
Between unequal havens built their town; <br />
Where Arethusa, round th&#8217; imprison&#8217;d sea, <br />
Extends her crooked coast to Cyane; <br />
The nymph who gave the neighb&#8217;ring lake a name, <br />
Of all Sicilian nymphs the first in fame, <br />
She from the waves advanc&#8217;d her beauteous head, <br />
The Goddess knew, and thus to Pluto said: <br />
Farther thou shalt not with the virgin run; <br />
Ceres unwilling, canst thou be her son? <br />
The maid shou&#8217;d be by sweet perswasion won. <br />
Force suits not with the softness of the fair; <br />
For, if great things with small I may compare, <br />
Me Anapis once lov&#8217;d; a milder course <br />
He took, and won me by his words, not force.</p>
<p>Then, stretching out her arms, she stopt his way; <br />
But he, impatient of the shortest stay, <br />
Throws to his dreadful steeds the slacken&#8217;d rein, <br />
And strikes his iron sceptre thro&#8217; the main; <br />
The depths profound thro&#8217; yielding waves he cleaves, <br />
And to Hell&#8217;s center a free passage leaves; <br />
Down sinks his chariot, and his realms of night <br />
The God soon reaches with a rapid flight.</p>
<p>Cyane dissolves to a Fountain</p>
<p>But still does Cyane the rape bemoan, <br />
And with the Goddess&#8217; wrongs laments her own; <br />
For the stoln maid, and for her injur&#8217;d spring, <br />
Time to her trouble no relief can bring. <br />
In her sad heart a heavy load she bears, <br />
&#8216;Till the dumb sorrow turns her all to tears. <br />
Her mingling waters with that fountain pass, <br />
Of which she late immortal Goddess was; <br />
Her varied members to a fluid melt, <br />
A pliant softness in her bones is felt; <br />
Her wavy locks first drop away in dew, <br />
And liquid next her slender fingers grew. <br />
The body&#8217;s change soon seizes its extreme, <br />
Her legs dissolve, and feet flow off in stream. <br />
Her arms, her back, her shoulders, and her side, <br />
Her swelling breasts in little currents glide, <br />
A silver liquor only now remains <br />
Within the channel of her purple veins; <br />
Nothing to fill love&#8217;s grasp; her husband chaste <br />
Bathes in that bosom he before embrac&#8217;d.</p>
<p>A Boy transform&#8217;d to an Eft</p>
<p>Thus, while thro&#8217; all the Earth, and all the main, <br />
Her daughter mournful Ceres sought in vain; <br />
Aurora, when with dewy looks she rose, <br />
Nor burnish&#8217;d Vesper found her in repose, <br />
At Aetna&#8217;s flaming mouth two pitchy pines <br />
To light her in her search at length she tines. <br />
Restless, with these, thro&#8217; frosty night she goes, <br />
Nor fears the cutting winds, nor heeds the snows; <br />
And, when the morning-star the day renews, <br />
From east to west her absent child pursues.</p>
<p>Thirsty at last by long fatigue she grows, <br />
But meets no spring, no riv&#8217;let near her flows. <br />
Then looking round, a lowly cottage spies, <br />
Smoaking among the trees, and thither hies. <br />
The Goddess knocking at the little door, <br />
&#8216;Twas open&#8217;d by a woman old and poor, <br />
Who, when she begg&#8217;d for water, gave her ale <br />
Brew&#8217;d long, but well preserv&#8217;d from being stale. <br />
The Goddess drank; a chuffy lad was by, <br />
Who saw the liquor with a grutching eye, <br />
And grinning cries, She&#8217;s greedy more than dry.</p>
<p>Ceres, offended at his foul grimace, <br />
Flung what she had not drunk into his face, <br />
The sprinklings speckle where they hit the skin, <br />
And a long tail does from his body spin; <br />
His arms are turn&#8217;d to legs, and lest his size <br />
Shou&#8217;d make him mischievous, and he might rise <br />
Against mankind, diminutives his frame, <br />
Less than a lizzard, but in shape the same. <br />
Amaz&#8217;d the dame the wondrous sight beheld, <br />
And weeps, and fain wou&#8217;d touch her quondam child. <br />
Yet her approach th&#8217; affrighted vermin shuns, <br />
And fast into the greatest crevice runs. <br />
A name they gave him, which the spots exprest, <br />
That rose like stars, and varied all his breast.</p>
<p>What lands, what seas the Goddess wander&#8217;d o&#8217;er, <br />
Were long to tell; for there remain&#8217;d no more. <br />
Searching all round, her fruitless toil she mourns, <br />
And with regret to Sicily returns. <br />
At length, where Cyane now flows, she came, <br />
Who cou&#8217;d have told her, were she still the same <br />
As when she saw her daughter sink to Hell; <br />
But what she knows she wants a tongue to tell. <br />
Yet this plain signal manifestly gave, <br />
The virgin&#8217;s girdle floating on a wave, <br />
As late she dropt it from her slender waste, <br />
When with her uncle thro&#8217; the deep she past. <br />
Ceres the token by her grief confest, <br />
And tore her golden hair, and beat her breast. <br />
She knows not on what land her curse shou&#8217;d fall, <br />
But, as ingrate, alike upbraids them all, <br />
Unworthy of her gifts; Trinacria most, <br />
Where the last steps she found of what she lost. <br />
The plough for this the vengeful Goddess broke, <br />
And with one death the ox, and owner struck, <br />
In vain the fallow fields the peasant tills, <br />
The seed, corrupted ere &#8217;tis sown, she kills. <br />
The fruitful soil, that once such harvests bore, <br />
Now mocks the farmer&#8217;s care, and teems no more. <br />
And the rich grain which fills the furrow&#8217;d glade, <br />
Rots in the seed, or shrivels in the blade; <br />
Or too much sun burns up, or too much rain <br />
Drowns, or black blights destroy the blasted plain; <br />
Or greedy birds the new-sown seed devour, <br />
Or darnel, thistles, and a crop impure <br />
Of knotted grass along the acres stand, <br />
And spread their thriving roots thro&#8217; all the land.</p>
<p>Then from the waves soft Arethusa rears <br />
Her head, and back she flings her dropping hairs. <br />
O mother of the maid, whom thou so far <br />
Hast sought, of whom thou canst no tidings hear; <br />
O thou, she cry&#8217;d, who art to life a friend, <br />
Cease here thy search, and let thy labour end. <br />
Thy faithful Sicily&#8217;s a guiltless clime, <br />
And shou&#8217;d not suffer for another&#8217;s crime; <br />
She neither knew, nor cou&#8217;d prevent the deed; <br />
Nor think that for my country thus I plead; <br />
My country&#8217;s Pisa, I&#8217;m an alien here, <br />
Yet these abodes to Elis I prefer, <br />
No clime to me so sweet, no place so dear. <br />
These springs I Arethusa now possess, <br />
And this my seat, o gracious Goddess, bless: <br />
This island why I love, and why I crost <br />
Such spacious seas to reach Ortygia&#8217;s coast, <br />
To you I shall impart, when, void of care, <br />
Your heart&#8217;s at ease, and you&#8217;re more fit to hear; <br />
When on your brow no pressing sorrow sits, <br />
For gay content alone such tales admits. <br />
When thro&#8217; Earth&#8217;s caverns I a-while have roul&#8217;d <br />
My waves, I rise, and here again behold <br />
The long-lost stars; and, as I late did glide <br />
Near Styx, Proserpina there I espy&#8217;d. <br />
Fear still with grief might in her face be seen; <br />
She still her rape laments; yet, made a queen, <br />
Beneath those gloomy shades her sceptre sways, <br />
And ev&#8217;n th&#8217; infernal king her will obeys.</p>
<p>This heard, the Goddess like a statue stood, <br />
Stupid with grief; and in that musing mood <br />
Continu&#8217;d long; new cares a-while supprest <br />
The reigning of her immortal breast. <br />
At last to Jove her daughter&#8217;s sire she flies, <br />
And with her chariot cuts the chrystal skies; <br />
She comes in clouds, and with dishevel&#8217;d hair, <br />
Standing before his throne, prefers her pray&#8217;r.</p>
<p>King of the Gods, defend my blood and thine, <br />
And use it not the worse for being mine. <br />
If I no more am gracious in thy sight, <br />
Be just, o Jove, and do thy daughter right. <br />
In vain I sought her the wide world around, <br />
And, when I most despair&#8217;d to find her, found. <br />
But how can I the fatal finding boast, <br />
By which I know she is for ever lost? <br />
Without her father&#8217;s aid, what other Pow&#8217;r <br />
Can to my arms the ravish&#8217;d maid restore? <br />
Let him restore her, I&#8217;ll the crime forgive; <br />
My child, tho&#8217; ravish&#8217;d, I&#8217;d with joy receive. <br />
Pity, your daughter with a thief shou&#8217;d wed, <br />
Tho&#8217; mine, you think, deserves no better bed.</p>
<p>Jove thus replies: It equally belongs <br />
To both, to guard our common pledge from wrongs. <br />
But if to things we proper names apply, <br />
This hardly can be call&#8217;d an injury. <br />
The theft is love; nor need we blush to own <br />
The thief, if I can judge, to be our son. <br />
Had you of his desert no other proof, <br />
To be Jove&#8217;s brother is methinks enough. <br />
Nor was my throne by worth superior got, <br />
Heav&#8217;n fell to me, as Hell to him, by lot: <br />
If you are still resolv&#8217;d her loss to mourn, <br />
And nothing less will serve than her return; <br />
Upon these terms she may again be yours <br />
(Th&#8217; irrevocable terms of fate, not ours), <br />
Of Stygian food if she did never taste, <br />
Hell&#8217;s bounds may then, and only then, be past.</p>
<p>The Transformation of Ascalaphus into an Owl</p>
<p>The Goddess now, resolving to succeed, <br />
Down to the gloomy shades descends with speed; <br />
But adverse fate had otherwise decreed. <br />
For, long before, her giddy thoughtless child <br />
Had broke her fast, and all her projects spoil&#8217;d. <br />
As in the garden&#8217;s shady walk she stray&#8217;d, <br />
A fair pomegranate charm&#8217;d the simple maid, <br />
Hung in her way, and tempting her to taste, <br />
She pluck&#8217;d the fruit, and took a short repast. <br />
Seven times, a seed at once, she eat the food; <br />
The fact Ascalaphus had only view&#8217;d; <br />
Whom Acheron begot in Stygian shades <br />
On Orphne, fam&#8217;d among Avernal maids; <br />
He saw what past, and by discov&#8217;ring all, <br />
Detain&#8217;d the ravish&#8217;d nymph in cruel thrall.</p>
<p>But now a queen, she with resentment heard, <br />
And chang&#8217;d the vile informer to a bird. <br />
In Phlegeton&#8217;s black stream her hand she dips, <br />
Sprinkles his head, and wets his babling lips. <br />
Soon on his face, bedropt with magick dew, <br />
A change appear&#8217;d, and gawdy feathers grew. <br />
A crooked beak the place of nose supplies, <br />
Rounder his head, and larger are his eyes. <br />
His arms and body waste, but are supply&#8217;d <br />
With yellow pinions flagging on each side. <br />
His nails grow crooked, and are turn&#8217;d to claws, <br />
And lazily along his heavy wings he draws. <br />
Ill-omen&#8217;d in his form, the unlucky fowl, <br />
Abhorr&#8217;d by men, and call&#8217;d a scrieching owl.</p>
<p>The Daughters of Achelous transform&#8217;d to Sirens</p>
<p>Justly this punishment was due to him, <br />
And less had been too little for his crime; <br />
But, o ye nymphs that from the flood descend, <br />
What fault of yours the Gods cou&#8217;d so offend, <br />
With wings and claws your beauteous forms to spoil, <br />
Yet save your maiden face, and winning smile? <br />
Were you not with her in Pergusa&#8217;s bow&#8217;rs, <br />
When Proserpine went forth to gather flow&#8217;rs? <br />
Since Pluto in his carr the Goddess caught, <br />
Have you not for her in each climate sought? <br />
And when on land you long had search&#8217;d in vain, <br />
You wish&#8217;d for wings to cross the pathless main; <br />
That Earth and Sea might witness to your care: <br />
The Gods were easy, and return&#8217;d your pray&#8217;r; <br />
With golden wing o&#8217;er foamy waves you fled, <br />
And to the sun your plumy glories spread. <br />
But, lest the soft enchantment of your songs, <br />
And the sweet musick of your flat&#8217;ring tongues <br />
Shou&#8217;d quite be lost (as courteous fates ordain), <br />
Your voice and virgin beauty still remain.</p>
<p>Jove some amends for Ceres lost to make, <br />
Yet willing Pluto shou&#8217;d the joy partake, <br />
Gives &#8216;em of Proserpine an equal share, <br />
Who, claim&#8217;d by both, with both divides the year. <br />
The Goddess now in either empire sways, <br />
Six moons in Hell, and six with Ceres stays. <br />
Her peevish temper&#8217;s chang&#8217;d; that sullen mind, <br />
Which made ev&#8217;n Hell uneasy, now is kind, <br />
Her voice refines, her mein more sweet appears, <br />
Her forehead free from frowns, her eyes from tears, <br />
As when, with golden light, the conqu&#8217;ring day <br />
Thro&#8217; dusky exhalations clears a way. <br />
Ceres her daughter&#8217;s rape no longer mourn&#8217;d, <br />
But back to Arethusa&#8217;s spring return&#8217;d; <br />
And sitting on the margin, bid her tell <br />
From whence she came, and why a sacred well.</p>
<p>The Story of Arethusa</p>
<p>Still were the purling waters, and the maid <br />
From the smooth surface rais&#8217;d her beauteous head, <br />
Wipes off the drops that from her tresses ran, <br />
And thus to tell Alpheus&#8217; loves began.</p>
<p>In Elis first I breath&#8217;d the living air, <br />
The chase was all my pleasure, all my care. <br />
None lov&#8217;d like me the forest to explore, <br />
To pitch the toils, and drive the bristled boar. <br />
Of fair, tho&#8217; masculine, I had the name, <br />
But gladly wou&#8217;d to that have quitted claim: <br />
It less my pride than indignation rais&#8217;d, <br />
To hear the beauty I neglected, prais&#8217;d; <br />
Such compliments I loath&#8217;d, such charms as these <br />
I scorn&#8217;d, and thought it infamy to please.</p>
<p>Once, I remember, in the summer&#8217;s heat, <br />
Tir&#8217;d with the chase, I sought a cool retreat; <br />
And, walking on, a silent current found, <br />
Which gently glided o&#8217;er the grav&#8217;ly ground. <br />
The chrystal water was so smooth, so clear, <br />
My eye distinguish&#8217;d ev&#8217;ry pebble there. <br />
So soft its motion, that I scarce perceiv&#8217;d <br />
The running stream, or what I saw believ&#8217;d. <br />
The hoary willow, and the poplar, made <br />
Along the shelving bank a grateful shade. <br />
In the cool rivulet my feet I dipt, <br />
Then waded to the knee, and then I stript; <br />
My robe I careless on an osier threw, <br />
That near the place commodiously grew; <br />
Nor long upon the border naked stood, <br />
But plung&#8217;d with speed into the silver flood. <br />
My arms a thousand ways I mov&#8217;d, and try&#8217;d <br />
To quicken, if I cou&#8217;d, the lazy tide; <br />
Where, while I play&#8217;d my swimming gambols o&#8217;er, <br />
I heard a murm&#8217;ring voice, and frighted sprung to shore. <br />
Oh! whither, Arethusa, dost thou fly? <br />
From the brook&#8217;s bottom did Alpheus cry; <br />
Again, I heard him, in a hollow tone, <br />
Oh! whither, Arethusa, dost thou run? <br />
Naked I flew, nor cou&#8217;d I stay to hide <br />
My limbs, my robe was on the other side; <br />
Alpheus follow&#8217;d fast, th&#8217; inflaming sight <br />
Quicken&#8217;d his speed, and made his labour light; <br />
He sees me ready for his eager arms, <br />
And with a greedy glance devours my charms. <br />
As trembling doves from pressing danger fly, <br />
When the fierce hawk comes sousing from the sky; <br />
And, as fierce hawks the trembling doves pursue, <br />
From him I fled, and after me he flew. <br />
First by Orchomenus I took my flight, <br />
And soon had Psophis and Cyllene in sight; <br />
Behind me then high Maenalus I lost, <br />
And craggy Erimanthus scal&#8217;d with frost; <br />
Elis was next; thus far the ground I trod <br />
With nimble feet, before the distanc&#8217;d God. <br />
But here I lagg&#8217;d, unable to sustain <br />
The labour longer, and my flight maintain; <br />
While he more strong, more patient of the toil, <br />
And fir&#8217;d with hopes of beauty&#8217;s speedy spoil, <br />
Gain&#8217;d my lost ground, and by redoubled pace, <br />
Now left between us but a narrow space. <br />
Unweary&#8217;d I &#8217;till now o&#8217;er hills, and plains, <br />
O&#8217;er rocks, and rivers ran, and felt no pains: <br />
The sun behind me, and the God I kept, <br />
But, when I fastest shou&#8217;d have run, I stept. <br />
Before my feet his shadow now appear&#8217;d; <br />
As what I saw, or rather what I fear&#8217;d. <br />
Yet there I could not be deceiv&#8217;d by fear, <br />
Who felt his breath pant on my braided hair, <br />
And heard his sounding tread, and knew him to be near. <br />
Tir&#8217;d, and despairing, O celestial maid, <br />
I&#8217;m caught, I cry&#8217;d, without thy heav&#8217;nly aid. <br />
Help me, Diana, help a nymph forlorn, <br />
Devoted to the woods, who long has worn <br />
Thy livery, and long thy quiver born. <br />
The Goddess heard; my pious pray&#8217;r prevail&#8217;d; <br />
In muffling clouds my virgin head was veil&#8217;d, <br />
The am&#8217;rous God, deluded of his hopes, <br />
Searches the gloom, and thro&#8217; the darkness gropes; <br />
Twice, where Diana did her servant hide <br />
He came, and twice, O Arethusa! cry&#8217;d. <br />
How shaken was my soul, how sunk my heart! <br />
The terror seiz&#8217;d on ev&#8217;ry trembling part. <br />
Thus when the wolf about the mountain prowls <br />
For prey, the lambkin hears his horrid howls: <br />
The tim&#8217;rous hare, the pack approaching nigh, <br />
Thus hearkens to the hounds, and trembles at the cry; <br />
Nor dares she stir, for fear her scented breath <br />
Direct the dogs, and guide the threaten&#8217;d death. <br />
Alpheus in the cloud no traces found <br />
To mark my way, yet stays to guard the ground, <br />
The God so near, a chilly sweat possest <br />
My fainting limbs, at ev&#8217;ry pore exprest; <br />
My strength distill&#8217;d in drops, my hair in dew, <br />
My form was chang&#8217;d, and all my substance new. <br />
Each motion was a stream, and my whole frame <br />
Turn&#8217;d to a fount, which still preserves my name. <br />
Resolv&#8217;d I shou&#8217;d not his embrace escape, <br />
Again the God resumes his fluid shape; <br />
To mix his streams with mine he fondly tries, <br />
But still Diana his attempt denies. <br />
She cleaves the ground; thro&#8217; caverns dark I run <br />
A diff&#8217;rent current, while he keeps his own. <br />
To dear Ortygia she conducts my way, <br />
And here I first review the welcome day.</p>
<p>Here Arethusa stopt; then Ceres takes <br />
Her golden carr, and yokes her fiery snakes; <br />
With a just rein, along mid-heaven she flies <br />
O&#8217;er Earth, and seas, and cuts the yielding skies. <br />
She halts at Athens, dropping like a star, <br />
And to Triptolemus resigns her carr. <br />
Parent of seed, she gave him fruitful grain, <br />
And bad him teach to till and plough the plain; <br />
The seed to sow, as well in fallow fields, <br />
As where the soil manur&#8217;d a richer harvest yields.</p>
<p>The Transformation of Lyncus</p>
<p>The youth o&#8217;er Europe and o&#8217;er Asia drives, <br />
&#8216;Till at the court of Lyncus he arrives. <br />
The tyrant Scythia&#8217;s barb&#8217;rous empire sway&#8217;d; <br />
And, when he saw Triptolemus, he said, <br />
How cam&#8217;st thou, stranger, to our court, and why? <br />
Thy country, and thy name? The youth did thus reply: <br />
Triptolemus my name; my country&#8217;s known <br />
O&#8217;er all the world, Minerva&#8217;s fav&#8217;rite town, <br />
Athens, the first of cities in renown. <br />
By land I neither walk&#8217;d, nor sail&#8217;d by sea, <br />
But hither thro&#8217; the Aether made my way. <br />
By me, the Goddess who the fields befriends, <br />
These gifts, the greatest of all blessings, sends. <br />
The grain she gives if in your soil you sow, <br />
Thence wholsom food in golden crops shall grow.</p>
<p>Soon as the secret to the king was known, <br />
He grudg&#8217;d the glory of the service done, <br />
And wickedly resolv&#8217;d to make it all his own. <br />
To hide his purpose, he invites his guest, <br />
The friend of Ceres, to a royal feast, <br />
And when sweet sleep his heavy eyes had seiz&#8217;d, <br />
The tyrant with his steel attempts his breast. <br />
Him strait a lynx&#8217;s shape the Goddess gives, <br />
And home the youth her sacred dragons drives.</p>
<p>The Pierides transform&#8217;d to Magpies</p>
<p>The chosen Muse here ends her sacred lays; <br />
The nymphs unanimous decree the bays, <br />
And give the Heliconian Goddesses the praise. <br />
Then, far from vain that we shou&#8217;d thus prevail, <br />
But much provok&#8217;d to hear the vanquish&#8217;d rail, <br />
Calliope resumes: Too long we&#8217;ve born <br />
Your daring taunts, and your affronting scorn; <br />
Your challenge justly merited a curse, <br />
And this unmanner&#8217;d railing makes it worse. <br />
Since you refuse us calmly to enjoy <br />
Our patience, next our passions we&#8217;ll employ; <br />
The dictates of a mind enrag&#8217;d pursue, <br />
And, what our just resentment bids us, do.</p>
<p>The railers laugh, our threats and wrath despise, <br />
And clap their hands, and make a scolding noise: <br />
But in the fact they&#8217;re seiz&#8217;d; beneath their nails <br />
Feathers they feel, and on their faces scales; <br />
Their horny beaks at once each other scare, <br />
Their arms are plum&#8217;d, and on their backs they bear <br />
Py&#8217;d wings, and flutter in the fleeting air. <br />
Chatt&#8217;ring, the scandal of the woods they fly, <br />
And there continue still their clam&#8217;rous cry: <br />
The same their eloquence, as maids, or birds, <br />
Now only noise, and nothing then but words. </p>
