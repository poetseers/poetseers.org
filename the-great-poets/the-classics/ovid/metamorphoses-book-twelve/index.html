				<p>The Trojan War</p>
<p>Priam, to whom the story was unknown, <br />
As dead, deplor&#8217;d his metamorphos&#8217;d son: <br />
A cenotaph his name, and title kept, <br />
And Hector round the tomb, with all his brothers, wept. <br />
This pious office Paris did not share; <br />
Absent alone; and author of the war, <br />
Which, for the Spartan queen, the Grecians drew <br />
T&#8217; avenge the rape; and Asia to subdue. <br />
A thousand ships were mann&#8217;d, to sail the sea: <br />
Nor had their just resentments found delay, <br />
Had not the winds, and waves oppos&#8217;d their way. <br />
At Aulis, with united pow&#8217;rs they meet, <br />
But there, cross-winds or calms detain&#8217;d the fleet. <br />
Now, while they raise an altar on the shore, <br />
And Jove with solemn sacrifice adore; <br />
A boding sign the priests and people see: <br />
A snake of size immense ascends a tree, <br />
And, in the leafie summit, spy&#8217;d a nest, <br />
Which o&#8217;er her callow young, a sparrow press&#8217;d. <br />
Eight were the birds unfledg&#8217;d; their mother flew, <br />
And hover&#8217;d round her care; but still in view: <br />
&#8216;Till the fierce reptile first devour&#8217;d the brood, <br />
Then seiz&#8217;d the flutt&#8217;ring dam, and drunk her blood. <br />
This dire ostent, the fearful people view; <br />
Calchas alone, by Phoebus taught, foreknew <br />
What Heav&#8217;n decreed; and with a smiling glance, <br />
Thus gratulates to Greece her happy chance: <br />
O Argives, we shall conquer: Troy is ours, <br />
But long delays shall first afflict our pow&#8217;rs: <br />
Nine years of labour, the nine birds portend; <br />
The tenth shall in the town&#8217;s destruction end.</p>
<p>The serpent, who his maw obscene had fill&#8217;d, <br />
The branches in his curl&#8217;d embraces held: <br />
But, as in spires he stood, he turn&#8217;d to stone: <br />
The stony snake retain&#8217;d the figure still his own.</p>
<p>Yet, not for this, the wind-bound navy weigh&#8217;d; <br />
Slack were their sails; and Neptune disobey&#8217;d. <br />
Some thought him loth the town should be destroy&#8217;d, <br />
Whose building had his hands divine employ&#8217;d: <br />
Not so the seer; who knew, and known foreshow&#8217;d, <br />
The virgin Phoebe, with a virgin&#8217;s blood <br />
Must first be reconcil&#8217;d: the common cause <br />
Prevail&#8217;d; and pity yielding to the laws, <br />
Fair Iphigenia the devoted maid <br />
Was, by the weeping priests, in linnen-robes array&#8217;d; <br />
All mourn her fate; but no relief appear&#8217;d; <br />
The royal victim bound, the knife already rear&#8217;d: <br />
When that offended Pow&#8217;r, who caus&#8217;d their woe, <br />
Relenting ceas&#8217;d her wrath; and stop&#8217;d the coming blow. <br />
A mist before the ministers she cast, <br />
And, in the virgin&#8217;s room, a hind she plac&#8217;d. <br />
Th&#8217; oblation slain, and Phoebe, reconcil&#8217;d, <br />
The storm was hush&#8217;d, and dimpled ocean smil&#8217;d: <br />
A favourable gale arose from shore, <br />
Which to the port desir&#8217;d, the Graecian gallies bore.</p>
<p>The House of Fame</p>
<p>Full in the midst of this created space, <br />
Betwixt Heav&#8217;n, Earth, and skies, there stands a place, <br />
Confining on all three, with triple bound; <br />
Whence all things, tho&#8217; remote, are view&#8217;d around; <br />
And thither bring their undulating sound. <br />
The palace of loud Fame, her seat of pow&#8217;r, <br />
Plac&#8217;d on the summet of a lofty tow&#8217;r; <br />
A thousand winding entries long and wide, <br />
Receive of fresh reports a flowing tide. <br />
A thousand crannies in the walls are made; <br />
Nor gate, nor bars exclude the busie trade. <br />
&#8216;Tis built of brass, the better to diffuse <br />
The spreading sounds, and multiply the news: <br />
Where eccho&#8217;s in repeated eccho&#8217;s play: <br />
A mart for ever full, and open night and day. <br />
Nor silence is within, nor voice express, <br />
But a deaf noise of sounds, that never cease. <br />
Confus&#8217;d and chiding, like the hollow roar <br />
Of tides, receding from th&#8217; insulted shore, <br />
Or like the broken thunder heard from far, <br />
When Jove at distance drives the rouling war. <br />
The courts are fill&#8217;d with a tumultuous din <br />
Of crouds, or issuing forth, or entring in: <br />
A thorough-fare of news: where some devise <br />
Things never heard, some mingle truth with lies; <br />
The troubled air with empty sounds they beat, <br />
Intent to hear, and eager to repeat. <br />
Error sits brooding there, with added train <br />
Of vain credulity, and joys as vain: <br />
Suspicion, with sedition join&#8217;d, are near, <br />
And rumours rais&#8217;d, and murmurs mix&#8217;d, and panique fear. <br />
Fame sits aloft, and sees the subject ground, <br />
And seas about, and skies above; enquiring all around.</p>
<p>The Goddess gives th&#8217; alarm; and soon is known <br />
The Grecian fleet descending on the town. <br />
Fix&#8217;d on defence, the Trojans are not slow <br />
To guard their shore, from an expected foe. <br />
They meet in fight: by Hector&#8217;s fatal hand <br />
Protesilaus falls, and bites the strand: <br />
Which with expence of blood the Grecians won; <br />
And prov&#8217;d the strength unknown of Priam&#8217;s son. <br />
And to their cost the Trojan leaders felt <br />
The Grecian heroes; and what deaths they dealt.</p>
<p>The Story of Cygnus</p>
<p>From these first onsets, the Sigaean shore <br />
Was strew&#8217;d with carcasses, and stain&#8217;d with gore: <br />
Neptunian Cygnus troops of Greeks had slain; <br />
Achilles in his carr had scour&#8217;d the plain, <br />
And clear&#8217;d the Trojan ranks: where-e&#8217;er he fought, <br />
Cygnus, or Hector, through the fields he sought: <br />
Cygnus he found; on him his force essay&#8217;d: <br />
For Hector was to the tenth year delay&#8217;d. <br />
His white-main&#8217;d steeds, that bow&#8217;d beneath the yoke, <br />
He chear&#8217;d to courage, with a gentle stroke; <br />
Then urg&#8217;d his fiery chariot on the foe; <br />
And rising shook his lance; in act to throw. <br />
But first he cry&#8217;d, O youth, be proud to bear <br />
Thy death, ennobled by Pelides&#8217; spear. <br />
The lance pursu&#8217;d the voice without delay, <br />
Nor did the whizzing weapon miss the way; <br />
But pierc&#8217;d his cuirass, with such fury sent, <br />
And sign&#8217;d his bosom with a purple dint. <br />
At this the seed of Neptune: Goddess-born, <br />
For ornament, not use, these arms are worn; <br />
This helm, and heavy buckler, I can spare; <br />
As only decorations of the war: <br />
So Mars is arm&#8217;d for glory, not for need. <br />
&#8216;Tis somewhat more from Neptune to proceed, <br />
Than from a daughter of the sea to spring: <br />
Thy sire is mortal; mine is ocean&#8217;s king. <br />
Secure of death, I shou&#8217;d contemn thy dart, <br />
Tho&#8217; naked; and impassible depart: <br />
He said, and threw: the trembling weapon pass&#8217;d <br />
Through nine bull-hides, each under other plac&#8217;d, <br />
On his broad shield; and stuck within the last. <br />
Achilles wrench&#8217;d it out; and sent again <br />
The hostile gift: the hostile gift was vain. <br />
He try&#8217;d a third, a tough well-chosen spear; <br />
Th&#8217; inviolable body stood sincere, <br />
Though Cygnus then did no defence provide, <br />
But scornful offer&#8217;d his unshielded side.</p>
<p>Not otherwise th&#8217; impatient hero far&#8217;d, <br />
Than as a bull incompass&#8217;d with a guard, <br />
Amid the Circus roars, provok&#8217;d from far <br />
By sight of scarlet, and a sanguine war: <br />
They quit their ground, his bended horns elude; <br />
In vain pursuing, and in vain pursu&#8217;d:</p>
<p>Before to farther fight he wou&#8217;d advance, <br />
He stood considering, and survey&#8217;d his lance. <br />
Doubts if he wielded not a wooden spear <br />
Without a point: he look&#8217;d, the point was there. <br />
This is my hand, and this my lance, he said; <br />
By which so many thousand foes are dead, <br />
O whither is their usual virtue fled! <br />
I had it once; and the Lyrnessian wall, <br />
And Tenedos, confess&#8217;d it in their fall. <br />
Thy streams, Caicus, rowl&#8217;d a crimson-flood; <br />
And Thebes ran red with her own natives&#8217; blood. <br />
Twice Telephus employ&#8217;d their piercing steel, <br />
To wound him first, and afterward to heal. <br />
The vigour of this arm was never vain: <br />
And that my wonted prowess I retain, <br />
Witness these heaps of slaughter on the plain. <br />
He said; and, doubtful of his former deeds, <br />
To some new tryal of his force proceeds. <br />
He chose Menoetes from among the rest; <br />
At him he launch&#8217;d his spear, and pierc&#8217;d his breast: <br />
On the hard earth the Lycian knock&#8217;d his head, <br />
And lay supine; and forth the spirit fled.</p>
<p>Then thus the hero: Neither can I blame <br />
The hand, or jav&#8217;lin; both are still the same. <br />
The same I will employ against this foe, <br />
And wish but with the same success to throw. <br />
So spoke the chief; and while he spoke he threw; <br />
The weapon with unerring fury flew, <br />
At his left shoulder aim&#8217;d: nor entrance found; <br />
But back, as from a rock, with swift rebound <br />
Harmless return&#8217;d: a bloody mark appear&#8217;d, <br />
Which with false joy the flatter&#8217;d hero chear&#8217;d. <br />
Wound there was none; the blood that was in view, <br />
The lance before from slain Menoetes drew.</p>
<p>Headlong he leaps from off his lofty car, <br />
And in close fight on foot renews the war. <br />
Raging with high disdain, repeats his blows; <br />
Nor shield, nor armour can their force oppose; <br />
Huge cantlets of his buckler strew the ground, <br />
And no defence in his bor&#8217;d arms is found, <br />
But on his flesh, no wound or blood is seen; <br />
The sword it self is blunted on the skin.</p>
<p>This vain attempt the chief no longer bears; <br />
But round his hollow temples and his ears <br />
His buckler beats: the son of Neptune, stunn&#8217;d <br />
With these repeated buffets, quits his ground; <br />
A sickly sweat succeeds, and shades of night; <br />
Inverted Nature swims before his sight: <br />
Th&#8217; insulting victor presses on the more, <br />
And treads the steps the vanquish&#8217;d trod before, <br />
Nor rest, nor respite gives. A stone there lay <br />
Behind his trembling foe, and stopp&#8217;d his way: <br />
Achilles took th&#8217; advantage which he found, <br />
O&#8217;er-turn&#8217;d, and push&#8217;d him backward on the ground, <br />
His buckler held him under, while he press&#8217;d, <br />
With both his knees, above his panting breast. <br />
Unlac&#8217;d his helm: about his chin the twist <br />
He ty&#8217;d; and soon the strangled soul dismiss&#8217;d.</p>
<p>With eager haste he went to strip the dead: <br />
The vanish&#8217;d body from his arms was fled. <br />
His sea-God sire, t&#8217; immortalize his frame, <br />
Had turn&#8217;d it to a bird that bears his name.</p>
<p>A truce succeeds the labours of this day, <br />
And arms suspended with a long delay. <br />
While Trojan walls are kept with watch and ward; <br />
The Greeks before their trenches mount the guard; <br />
The feast approach&#8217;d; when to the blue-ey&#8217;d maid <br />
His vows for Cygnus slain the victor paid, <br />
And a white heyfer on her altar laid. <br />
The reeking entrails on the fire they threw, <br />
And to the Gods the grateful odour flew. <br />
Heav&#8217;n had its part in sacrifice: the rest <br />
Was broil&#8217;d, and roasted for the future feast. <br />
The chief-invited guests were set around! <br />
And hunger first asswag&#8217;d, the bowls were crown&#8217;d, <br />
Which in deep draughts their cares, and labours drown&#8217;d. <br />
The mellow harp did not their ears employ: <br />
And mute was all the warlike symphony: <br />
Discourse, the food of souls, was their delight, <br />
And pleasing chat prolong&#8217;d the summer&#8217;s night. <br />
The subject, deeds of arms; and valour shown, <br />
Or on the Trojan side, or on their own. <br />
Of dangers undertaken, fame atchiev&#8217;d, <br />
They talk&#8217;d by turns; the talk by turns reliev&#8217;d. <br />
What things but these could fierce Achilles tell, <br />
Or what cou&#8217;d fierce Achilles hear so well? <br />
The last great act perform&#8217;d, of Cygnus slain, <br />
Did most the martial audience entertain: <br />
Wondring to find a body free by Fate <br />
From steel; and which cou&#8217;d ev&#8217;n that steel rebate: <br />
Amaz&#8217;d, their admiration they renew; <br />
And scarce Pelides cou&#8217;d believe it true.</p>
<p>The Story of Caeneus</p>
<p>Then Nestor thus: what once this age has known, <br />
In fated Cygnus, and in him alone, <br />
These eyes have seen in Caeneus long before; <br />
Whose body not a thousand swords cou&#8217;d bore. <br />
Caeneus, in courage, and in strength, excell&#8217;d; <br />
And still his Othrys with his fame is fill&#8217;d: <br />
But what did most his martial deeds adorn <br />
(Though since he chang&#8217;d his sex) a woman born.</p>
<p>A novelty so strange, and full of Fate, <br />
His list&#8217;ning audience ask&#8217;d him to relate. <br />
Achilles thus commends their common sute: <br />
O father, first for prudence in repute, <br />
Tell, with that eloquence, so much thy own, <br />
What thou hast heard, or what of Caeneus known: <br />
What was he, whence his change of sex begun, <br />
What trophies, join&#8217;d in wars with thee, he won? <br />
Who conquer&#8217;d him, and in what fatal strife <br />
The youth, without a wound, cou&#8217;d lose his life?</p>
<p>Neleides then: Though tardy age, and time, <br />
Have shrunk my sinews, and decay&#8217;d my prime; <br />
Though much I have forgotten of my store, <br />
Yet not exhausted, I remember more. <br />
Of all that arms atchiev&#8217;d, or peace design&#8217;d, <br />
That action still is fresher in my mind, <br />
Than ought beside. If reverend age can give <br />
To faith a sanction, in my third I live.</p>
<p>&#8216;Twas in my second cent&#8217;ry, I survey&#8217;d <br />
Young Caenis, then a fair Thessalian maid: <br />
Caenis the bright, was born to high command; <br />
A princess, and a native of thy land, <br />
Divine Achilles; every tongue proclaim&#8217;d <br />
Her beauty, and her eyes all hearts inflam&#8217;d. <br />
Peleus, thy sire, perhaps had sought her bed, <br />
Among the rest; but he had either led <br />
Thy mother then; or was by promise ty&#8217;d; <br />
But she to him, and all, alike her love deny&#8217;d.</p>
<p>It was her fortune once to take her way <br />
Along the sandy margin of the sea: <br />
The Pow&#8217;r of ocean view&#8217;d her as she pass&#8217;d, <br />
And, lov&#8217;d as soon as seen, by force embrac&#8217;d. <br />
So Fame reports. Her virgin-treasure seiz&#8217;d, <br />
And his new joys, the ravisher so pleas&#8217;d, <br />
That thus, transported, to the nymph he cry&#8217;d; <br />
Ask what thou wilt, no pray&#8217;r shall be deny&#8217;d. <br />
This also Fame relates: the haughty fair, <br />
Who not the rape ev&#8217;n of a God cou&#8217;d bear, <br />
This answer, proud, return&#8217;d: To mighty wrongs <br />
A mighty recompence, of right, belongs. <br />
Give me no more to suffer such a shame; <br />
But change the woman, for a better name; <br />
One gift for all: she said; and while she spoke, <br />
A stern, majestick, manly tone she took. <br />
A man she was: and as the Godhead swore, <br />
To Caeneus turn&#8217;d, who Caenis was before.</p>
<p>To this the lover adds, without request, <br />
No force of steel shou&#8217;d violate his breast. <br />
Glad of the gift, the new-made warrior goes; <br />
And arms among the Greeks, and longs for equal foes.</p>
<p>The Skirmish between the Centaurs and Lapithites</p>
<p>Now brave Perithous, bold Ixion&#8217;s son, <br />
The love of fair Hippodame had won. <br />
The cloud-begotten race, half men, half beast, <br />
Invited, came to grace the nuptial feast: <br />
In a cool cave&#8217;s recess the treat was made, <br />
Whose entrance, trees with spreading boughs o&#8217;er-shade <br />
They sate: and summon&#8217;d by the bridegroom, came, <br />
To mix with those, the Lapythaean name: <br />
Nor wanted I: the roofs with joy resound: <br />
And Hymen, Io Hymen, rung around. <br />
Rais&#8217;d altars shone with holy fires; the bride, <br />
Lovely her self (and lovely by her side <br />
A bevy of bright nymphs, with sober grace), <br />
Came glitt&#8217;ring like a star, and took her place. <br />
Her heav&#8217;nly form beheld, all wish&#8217;d her joy; <br />
And little wanted; but in vain, their wishes all employ.</p>
<p>For one, most brutal, of the brutal brood, <br />
Or whether wine, or beauty fir&#8217;d his blood, <br />
Or both at once, beheld with lustful eyes <br />
The bride; at once resolv&#8217;d to make his prize. <br />
Down went the board; and fastning on her hair, <br />
He seiz&#8217;d with sudden force the frighted fair. <br />
&#8216;Twas Eurytus began: his bestial kind <br />
His crime pursu&#8217;d; and each as pleas&#8217;d his mind, <br />
Or her, whom chance presented, took: the feast <br />
An image of a taken town express&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The cave resounds with female shrieks; we rise, <br />
Mad with revenge to make a swift reprise: <br />
And Theseus first, What phrenzy has possess&#8217;d, <br />
O Eurytus, he cry&#8217;d, thy brutal breast, <br />
To wrong Perithous, and not him alone, <br />
But while I live, two friends conjoyn&#8217;d in one?</p>
<p>To justifie his threat, he thrusts aside <br />
The crowd of centaurs; and redeems the bride: <br />
The monster nought reply&#8217;d: for words were vain, <br />
And deeds cou&#8217;d only deeds unjust maintain; <br />
But answers with his hand, and forward press&#8217;d, <br />
With blows redoubled, on his face, and breast. <br />
An ample goblet stood, of antick mold, <br />
And rough with figures of the rising gold; <br />
The hero snatch&#8217;d it up, and toss&#8217;d in air <br />
Full at the front of the foul ravisher. <br />
He falls; and falling vomits forth a flood <br />
Of wine, and foam, and brains, and mingled blood. <br />
Half roaring, and half neighing through the hall, <br />
Arms, arms, the double-form&#8217;d with fury call; <br />
To wreak their brother&#8217;s death: a medley-flight <br />
Of bowls, and jars, at first supply the fight, <br />
Once instruments of feasts; but now of Fate; <br />
Wine animates their rage, and arms their hate.</p>
<p>Bold Amycus, from the robb&#8217;d vestry brings <br />
The chalices of Heav&#8217;n; and holy things <br />
Of precious weight: a sconce that hung on high, <br />
With tapers fill&#8217;d, to light the sacristy, <br />
Torn from the cord, with his unhallow&#8217;d hand <br />
He threw amid the Lapythaean band. <br />
On Celadon the ruin fell; and left <br />
His face of feature, and of form bereft: <br />
So, when some brawny sacrificer knocks, <br />
Before an altar led, an offer&#8217;d ox, <br />
His eyes-balls rooted out, are thrown to ground; <br />
His nose, dismantled, in his mouth is found; <br />
His jaws, cheeks, front, one undistinguish&#8217;d wound.</p>
<p>This, Belates, th&#8217; avenger, cou&#8217;d not brook; <br />
But, by the foot, a maple board he took; <br />
And hurl&#8217;d at Amycus; his chin it bent <br />
Against his chest, and down the centaur sent: <br />
Whom sputtring bloody teeth, the second blow <br />
Of his drawn sword, dispatch&#8217;d to shades below.</p>
<p>Grineus was near; and cast a furious look <br />
On the side-altar, cens&#8217;d with sacred smoke, <br />
And bright with flaming fires; The Gods, he cry&#8217;d, <br />
Have with their holy trade our hands supply&#8217;d: <br />
Why use we not their gifts? Then from the floor <br />
An altar stone he heav&#8217;d, with all the load it bore: <br />
Altar, and altar&#8217;s freight together slew, <br />
Where thickest throng&#8217;d the Lapythaean crew: <br />
And, at once, Broteas and Oryus flew. <br />
Oryus&#8217; mother, Mycale, was known <br />
Down from her sphere to draw the lab&#8217;ring moon.</p>
<p>Exadius cry&#8217;d, Unpunish&#8217;d shall not go <br />
This fact, if arms are found against the foe. <br />
He look&#8217;d about, where on a pine were spread <br />
The votive horns of a stag&#8217;s branching head: <br />
At Grineus these he throws; so just they fly, <br />
That the sharp antlers stuck in either eye: <br />
Breathless, and blind he fell; with blood besmear&#8217;d; <br />
His eye-balls beaten out, hung dangling on his beard. <br />
Fierce Rhoetus, from the hearth a burning brand <br />
Selects, and whirling waves; &#8217;till, from his hand <br />
The fire took flame; then dash&#8217;d it from the right, <br />
On fair Charaxus&#8217; temples, near the sight: <br />
The whistling pest came on, and pierc&#8217;d the bone, <br />
And caught the yellow hair, that shrivel&#8217;d while it shone. <br />
Caught, like dry stubble fir&#8217;d; or like seerwood; <br />
Yet from the wound ensu&#8217;d no purple flood; <br />
But look&#8217;d a bubbling mass of frying blood. <br />
His blazing locks sent forth a crackling sound; <br />
And hiss&#8217;d, like red hot ir&#8217;n within the smithy drown&#8217;d. <br />
The wounded warrior shook his flaming hair, <br />
Then (what a team of horse could hardly rear) <br />
He heaves the threshold stone, but could not throw; <br />
The weight itself forbad the threaten&#8217;d blow; <br />
Which dropping from his lifted arms, came down <br />
Full on Cometes&#8217; head; and crush&#8217;d his crown. <br />
Nor Rhoetus then retain&#8217;d his joy; but said, <br />
So by their fellows may our foes be sped; <br />
Then, with redoubled strokes he plies his head: <br />
The burning lever not deludes his pains: <br />
But drives the batter&#8217;d skull within the brains.</p>
<p>Thus flush&#8217;d, the conqueror, with force renew&#8217;d, <br />
Evagrus, Dryas, Corythus, pursu&#8217;d: <br />
First, Corythus, with downy cheeks, he slew; <br />
Whose fall, when fierce Evagrus had in view, <br />
He cry&#8217;d, What palm is from a beardless prey? <br />
Rhoetus prevents what more he had to say; <br />
And drove within his mouth the fi&#8217;ry death, <br />
Which enter&#8217;d hissing in, and choak&#8217;d his breath. <br />
At Dryas next he flew: but weary chance, <br />
No longer wou&#8217;d the same success advance. <br />
For while he whirl&#8217;d in fiery circles round <br />
The brand, a sharpen&#8217;d stake strong Dryas found; <br />
And in the shoulder&#8217;s joint inflicts the wound. <br />
The weapon stuck; which, roaring out with pain, <br />
He drew; nor longer durst the fight maintain, <br />
But turn&#8217;d his back, for fear; and fled amain. <br />
With him fled Orneus, with like dread possess&#8217;d, <br />
Thaumas, and Medon wounded in the breast; <br />
And Mermeros, in the late race renown&#8217;d, <br />
Now limping ran, and tardy with his wound. <br />
Pholus, and Melaneus from fight withdrew, <br />
And Abas maim&#8217;d, who boars encountring slew: <br />
And Augur Asbolos, whose art in vain, <br />
From fight dissuaded the four-footed train, <br />
Now beat the hoof with Nessus on the plain; <br />
But to his fellow cry&#8217;d, Be safely slow, <br />
Thy death deferr&#8217;d is due to great Alcides&#8217; bow.</p>
<p>Mean-time strong Dryas urg&#8217;d his chance so well, <br />
That Lycidas, Areos, Imbreus fell; <br />
All, one by one, and fighting face to face: <br />
Crenaeus fled, to fall with more disgrace: <br />
For, fearful, while he look&#8217;d behind, he bore, <br />
Betwixt his nose, and front, the blow before. <br />
Amid the noise, and tumult of the fray, <br />
Snoring, and drunk with wine, Aphidas lay. <br />
Ev&#8217;n then the bowl within his hand he kept, <br />
And on a bear&#8217;s rough hide securely slept. <br />
Him Phorbas with his flying dart transfix&#8217;d; <br />
Take thy next draught, with Stygian waters mix&#8217;d, <br />
And sleep thy fill, th&#8217; insulting victor cry&#8217;d; <br />
Surpriz&#8217;d with death unfelt, the centaur dy&#8217;d; <br />
The ruddy vomit, as he breath&#8217;d his soul <br />
Repass&#8217;d his throat, and fill&#8217;d his empty bowl.</p>
<p>I saw Petraeus&#8217; arms employ&#8217;d around <br />
A well-grown oak, to root it from the ground. <br />
This way, and that, he wrench&#8217;d the fibrous bands; <br />
The trunk was like a sappling, in his hands, <br />
And still obey&#8217;d the bent: while thus he stood, <br />
Perithous&#8217; dart drove on; and nail&#8217;d him to the wood; <br />
Lycus, and Chromis fell, by him oppress&#8217;d: <br />
Helops, and Dictis added to the rest <br />
A nobler palm: Helops, through either ear <br />
Transfix&#8217;d, receiv&#8217;d the penetrating spear. <br />
This Dictis saw; and, seiz&#8217;d with sudden fright, <br />
Leapt headlong from the hill of steepy height; <br />
And crush&#8217;d an ash beneath, that cou&#8217;d not bear his weight. <br />
The shatter&#8217;d tree receives his fall; and strikes, <br />
Within his full-blown paunch, the sharpen&#8217;d spikes. <br />
Strong Aphareus had heav&#8217;d a mighty stone, <br />
The fragment of a rock; and wou&#8217;d have thrown; <br />
But Theseus, with a club of harden&#8217;d oak, <br />
The cubit-bone of the bold centaur broke; <br />
And left him maim&#8217;d; nor seconded the stroke. <br />
Then leapt on tall Bianor&#8217;s back (who bore <br />
No mortal burden but his own, before); <br />
Press&#8217;d with his knees his sides; the double man, <br />
His speed with spurs increas&#8217;d, unwilling ran. <br />
One hand the hero fastn&#8217;d on his locks; <br />
His other ply&#8217;d him with repeated strokes. <br />
The club rung round his ears, and batter&#8217;d brows; <br />
He falls; and lashing up his heels, his rider throws.</p>
<p>The same Herculean arms, Nedymnus wound; <br />
And lay by him Lycotas on the ground, <br />
And Hippasus, whose beard his breast invades; <br />
And Ripheus, haunter of the woodland shades: <br />
And Thereus, us&#8217;d with mountain-bears to strive, <br />
And from their dens to draw th&#8217; indignant beasts alive.</p>
<p>Demoleon cou&#8217;d not bear this hateful sight, <br />
Or the long fortune of th&#8217; Athenian knight: <br />
But pull&#8217;d with all his force, to disengage <br />
From Earth a pine, the product of an age: <br />
The root stuck fast: the broken trunk he sent <br />
At Theseus; Theseus frustrates his intent, <br />
And leaps aside; by Pallas warn&#8217;d, the blow <br />
To shun (for so he said; and we believ&#8217;d it so). <br />
Yet not in vain th&#8217; enormous weight was cast; <br />
Which Crantor&#8217;s body sunder&#8217;d at the waist: <br />
Thy father&#8217;s &#8216;squire, Achilles, and his care; <br />
Whom conquer&#8217;d in the Polopeian war, <br />
Their king, his present ruin to prevent, <br />
A pledge of peace implor&#8217;d, to Peleus sent.</p>
<p>Thy sire, with grieving eyes, beheld his Fate; <br />
And cry&#8217;d, Not long, lov&#8217;d Crantor, shalt thou wait <br />
Thy vow&#8217;d revenge. At once he said, and threw <br />
His ashen-spear; which quiver&#8217;d, as it flew; <br />
With all his force, and all his soul apply&#8217;d; <br />
The sharp point enter&#8217;d in the centaur&#8217;s side: <br />
Both hands, to wrench it out, the monster join&#8217;d; <br />
And wrench&#8217;d it out; but left the steel behind; <br />
Stuck in his lungs it stood: inrag&#8217;d he rears <br />
His hoofs, and down to ground thy father bears. <br />
Thus trampled under foot, his shield defends <br />
His head; his other hand the lance portends. <br />
Ev&#8217;n while he lay extended on the dust, <br />
He sped the centaur, with one single thrust. <br />
Two more his lance before transfix&#8217;d from far; <br />
And two, his sword had slain, in closer war. <br />
To these was added Dorylas, who spread <br />
A bull&#8217;s two goring horns around his head. <br />
With these he push&#8217;d; in blood already dy&#8217;d, <br />
Him fearless, I approach&#8217;d; and thus defy&#8217;d: <br />
Now, monster, now, by proof it shall appear, <br />
Whether thy horns are sharper, or my spear. <br />
At this, I threw: for want of other ward, <br />
He lifted up his hand, his front to guard. <br />
His hand it pass&#8217;d; and fix&#8217;d it to his brow: <br />
Loud shouts of ours attend the lucky blow. <br />
Him Peleus finish&#8217;d, with a second wound, <br />
Which thro&#8217; the navel pierc&#8217;d: he reel&#8217;d around; <br />
And dragg&#8217;d his dangling bowels on the ground. <br />
Trod what he drag&#8217;d; and what he trod, he crush&#8217;d: <br />
And to his mother-Earth, with empty belly, rush&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The Story of Cyllarus and Hylonome</p>
<p>Nor cou&#8217;d thy form, o Cyllarus, foreflow <br />
Thy Fate (if form to monsters men allow): <br />
Just bloom&#8217;d thy beard: thy beard of golden hue: <br />
Thy locks, in golden waves, about thy shoulders flew. <br />
Sprightly thy look: thy shapes in ev&#8217;ry part <br />
So clean, as might instruct the sculptor&#8217;s art; <br />
As far as man extended: where began <br />
The beast, the beast was equal to the man. <br />
Add but a horse&#8217;s head and neck; and he, <br />
O Castor, was a courser worthy thee. <br />
So was his back proportion&#8217;d for the seat: <br />
So rose his brawny chest; so swiftly mov&#8217;d his feet. <br />
Coal-black his colour, but like jett it shone; <br />
His legs, and flowing tail were white alone. <br />
Belov&#8217;d by many maidens of his kind; <br />
But fair Hylonome possess&#8217;d his mind; <br />
Hylonome, for features, and for face, <br />
Excelling all the nymphs of double race: <br />
Nor less her blandishments, than beauty, move; <br />
At once both loving, and confessing love. <br />
For him she dress&#8217;d: for him, with female care <br />
She comb&#8217;d, and set in curls, her auburn hair. <br />
Of roses, violets, and lillies mix&#8217;d, <br />
And sprigs of flowing rosemary betwixt, <br />
She form&#8217;d the chaplet, that adorn&#8217;d her front: <br />
In waters of the Pegasaean fount, <br />
And in the streams that from the fountain play, <br />
She wash&#8217;d her face; and bath&#8217;d her twice a-day. <br />
The scarf of furs, that hung below her side, <br />
Was ermin, or the panther&#8217;s spotted pride; <br />
Spoils of no common beast: with equal flame <br />
They lov&#8217;d: their silvan pleasures were the same: <br />
All day they hunted: and when day expir&#8217;d, <br />
Together to some shady cave retir&#8217;d: <br />
Invited to the nuptials, both repair: <br />
And, side by side, they both engage in war.</p>
<p>Uncertain from what hand, a flying dart <br />
At Cyllarus was sent; which pierc&#8217;d his heart. <br />
The jav&#8217;lin drawn from out the mortal wound, <br />
He faints with stagg&#8217;ring steps; and seeks the ground: <br />
The fair within her arms receiv&#8217;d his fall, <br />
And strove his wand&#8217;ring spirits to recall: <br />
And while her hand the streaming blood oppos&#8217;d, <br />
Join&#8217;d face to face, his lips with hers she clos&#8217;d. <br />
Stifled with kisses, a sweet death he dies; <br />
She fills the fields with undistinguish&#8217;d cries; <br />
At least her words were in her clamour drown&#8217;d; <br />
For my stunn&#8217;d ears receiv&#8217;d no vocal sound. <br />
In madness of her grief, she seiz&#8217;d the dart <br />
New-drawn, and reeking from her lover&#8217;s heart; <br />
To her bare bosom the sharp point apply&#8217;d; <br />
And wounded fell; and falling by his side, <br />
Embrac&#8217;d him in her arms; and thus embracing dy&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Ev&#8217;n still methinks, I see Phaeocomes; <br />
Strange was his habit, and as odd his dress. <br />
Six lions&#8217; hides, with thongs together fast, <br />
His upper part defended to his waist: <br />
And where man ended, the continued vest, <br />
Spread on his back, the houss and trappings of a beast. <br />
A stump too heavy for a team to draw <br />
(It seems a fable, tho&#8217; the fact I saw); <br />
He threw at Pholon; the descending blow <br />
Divides the skull, and cleaves his head in two. <br />
The brains, from nose, and mouth, and either ear, <br />
Came issuing out, as through a colendar <br />
The curdled milk; or from the press the whey, <br />
Driv&#8217;n down by weight above, is drain&#8217;d away.</p>
<p>But him, while stooping down to spoil the slain, <br />
Pierc&#8217;d through the paunch, I tumbled on the plain. <br />
Then Chthonyus, and Teleboas I slew: <br />
A fork the former arm&#8217;d; a dart his fellow threw. <br />
The jav&#8217;lin wounded me (behold the scar, <br />
Then was my time to seek the Trojan war; <br />
Then I was Hector&#8217;s match in open field; <br />
But he was then unborn; at least a child: <br />
Now, I am nothing). I forbear to tell <br />
By Periphantas how Pyretus fell; <br />
The centaur by the knight: nor will I stay <br />
On Amphix, or what deaths he dealt that day: <br />
What honour, with a pointless lance, he won, <br />
Stuck in the front of a four-footed man. <br />
What fame young Macareus obtain&#8217;d in fight: <br />
Or dwell on Nessus, now return&#8217;d from flight. <br />
How prophet Mopsus not alone divin&#8217;d, <br />
Whose valour equal&#8217;d his foreseeing mind.</p>
<p>Caeneus transform&#8217;d to an Eagle</p>
<p>Already Caeneus, with his conquering hand, <br />
Had slaughter&#8217;d five the boldest of their band. <br />
Pyrachmus, Helymus, Antimachus, <br />
Bromus the brave, and stronger Stiphelus, <br />
Their names I number&#8217;d, and remember well, <br />
No trace remaining, by what wounds they fell.</p>
<p>Laitreus, the bulki&#8217;st of the double race, <br />
Whom the spoil&#8217;d arms of slain Halesus grace, <br />
In years retaining still his youthful might, <br />
Though his black hairs were interspers&#8217;d with white, <br />
Betwixt th&#8217; imbattled ranks began to prance, <br />
Proud of his helm, and Macedonian lance; <br />
And rode the ring around; that either hoast <br />
Might hear him, while he made this empty boast: <br />
And from a strumpet shall we suffer shame? <br />
For Caenis still, not Caeneus, is thy name: <br />
And still the native softness of thy kind <br />
Prevails; and leaves the woman in thy mind; <br />
Remember what thou wert; what price was paid <br />
To change thy sex; to make thee not a maid: <br />
And but a man in shew; go, card and spin; <br />
And leave the business of the war to men.</p>
<p>While thus the boaster exercis&#8217;d his pride, <br />
The fatal spear of Caeneus reach&#8217;d his side: <br />
Just in the mixture of the kinds it ran; <br />
Betwixt the neather beast, and upper man: <br />
The monster mad with rage, and stung with smart, <br />
His lance directed at the hero&#8217;s heart: <br />
It struck; but bounded from his harden&#8217;d breast, <br />
Like hail from tiles, which the safe house invest. <br />
Nor seem&#8217;d the stroke with more effect to come, <br />
Than a small pebble falling on a drum. <br />
He next his fauchion try&#8217;d, in closer fight; <br />
But the keen fauchion had no pow&#8217;r to bite. <br />
He thrust; the blunted point return&#8217;d again: <br />
Since downright blows, he cry&#8217;d, and thrusts are vain, <br />
I&#8217;ll prove his side; in strong embraces held <br />
He prov&#8217;d his side; his side the sword repell&#8217;d: <br />
His hollow belly eccho&#8217;d to the stroke, <br />
Untouch&#8217;d his body, as a solid rock; <br />
Aim&#8217;d at his neck at last, the blade in shivers broke.</p>
<p>Th&#8217; impassive knight stood idle, to deride <br />
His rage, and offer&#8217;d oft his naked side; <br />
At length, Now monster, in thy turn, he cry&#8217;d, <br />
Try thou the strength of Caeneus: at the word <br />
He thrust; and in his shoulder plung&#8217;d the sword. <br />
Then writh&#8217;d his hand; and as he drove it down, <br />
Deep in his breast, made many wounds in one.</p>
<p>The centaurs saw, inrag&#8217;d, th&#8217; unhop&#8217;d success; <br />
And rushing on in crowds, together press; <br />
At him, and him alone, their darts they threw: <br />
Repuls&#8217;d they from his fated body flew. <br />
Amaz&#8217;d they stood; &#8217;till Monichus began, <br />
O shame, a nation conquer&#8217;d by a man! <br />
A woman-man! yet more a man is he, <br />
Than all our race; and what he was, are we. <br />
Now, what avail our nerves? th&#8217; united force, <br />
Of two the strongest creatures, man and horse; <br />
Nor Goddess-born; nor of Ixion&#8217;s seed <br />
We seem (a lover built for Juno&#8217;s bed); <br />
Master&#8217;d by this half man. Whole mountains throw <br />
With woods at once, and bury him below. <br />
This only way remains. Nor need we doubt <br />
To choak the soul within; though not to force it out: <br />
Heap weights, instead of wounds. He chanc&#8217;d to see <br />
Where southern storms had rooted up a tree; <br />
This, rais&#8217;d from Earth, against the foe he threw; <br />
Th&#8217; example shewn, his fellow-brutes pursue. <br />
With forest-loads the warrior they invade; <br />
Othrys, and Pelion soon were void of shade; <br />
And spreading groves were naked mountains made. <br />
Press&#8217;d with the burden, Caeneus pants for breath; <br />
And on his shoulders bears the wooden death. <br />
To heave th&#8217; intolerable weight he tries; <br />
At length it rose above his mouth and eyes: <br />
Yet still he heaves; and, strugling with despair, <br />
Shakes all aside, and gains a gulp of air: <br />
A short relief, which but prolongs his pain; <br />
He faints by fits; and then respires again: <br />
At last, the burden only nods above, <br />
As when an earthquake stirs th&#8217; Idaean grove. <br />
Doubtful his death: he suffocated seem&#8217;d, <br />
To most; but otherwise our Mopsus deem&#8217;d, <br />
Who said he saw a yellow bird arise <br />
From out the piles, and cleave the liquid skies: <br />
I saw it too, with golden feathers bright; <br />
Nor e&#8217;er before beheld so strange a sight. <br />
Whom Mopsus viewing, as it soar&#8217;d around <br />
Our troop, and heard the pinions&#8217; rattling sound, <br />
All hail, he cry&#8217;d, thy country&#8217;s grace and love! <br />
Once first of men below, now first of birds above. <br />
Its author to the story gave belief: <br />
For us, our courage was increas&#8217;d by grief: <br />
Asham&#8217;d to see a single man, pursu&#8217;d <br />
With odds, to sink beneath a multitude, <br />
We push&#8217;d the foe: and forc&#8217;d to shameful flight, <br />
Part fell, and part escap&#8217;d by favour of the night.</p>
<p>The Fate of Periclymenos</p>
<p>This tale, by Nestor told, did much displease <br />
Tlepolemus, the seed of Hercules: <br />
For, often he had heard his father say, <br />
That he himself was present at the fray; <br />
And more than shar&#8217;d the glories of the day.</p>
<p>Old Chronicle, he said, among the rest, <br />
You might have nam&#8217;d Alcides at the least: <br />
Is he not worth your praise? The Pylian prince <br />
Sigh&#8217;d ere he spoke; then made this proud defence. <br />
My former woes in long oblivion drown&#8217;d, <br />
I wou&#8217;d have lost; but you renew the wound: <br />
Better to pass him o&#8217;er, than to relate <br />
The cause I have your mighty sire to hate. <br />
His fame has fill&#8217;d the world, and reach&#8217;d the sky <br />
(Which, oh, I wish, with truth, I cou&#8217;d deny!); <br />
We praise not Hector; though his name, we know, <br />
Is great in arms; &#8217;tis hard to praise a foe.</p>
<p>He, your great father, levell&#8217;d to the ground <br />
Messenia&#8217;s tow&#8217;rs: nor better fortune found <br />
Elis, and Pylos; that a neighb&#8217;ring state, <br />
And this my own: both guiltless of their fate.</p>
<p>To pass the rest, twelve, wanting one, he slew; <br />
My brethren, who their birth from Neleus drew, <br />
All youths of early promise, had they liv&#8217;d; <br />
By him they perish&#8217;d: I alone surviv&#8217;d. <br />
The rest were easie conquest: but the fate <br />
Of Periclymenos, is wondrous to relate. <br />
To him, our common grandsire of the main <br />
Had giv&#8217;n to change his form, and chang&#8217;d, resume again. <br />
Vary&#8217;d at pleasure, every shape he try&#8217;d; <br />
And in all beasts, Alcides still defy&#8217;d: <br />
Vanquish&#8217;d on Earth, at length he soar&#8217;d above; <br />
Chang&#8217;d to the bird, that bears the bolt of Jove: <br />
The new-dissembled eagle, now endu&#8217;d <br />
With beak, and pounces, Hercules pursu&#8217;d, <br />
And cuff&#8217;d his manly cheeks, and tore his face; <br />
Then, safe retir&#8217;d, and tour&#8217;d in empty space. <br />
Alcides bore not long his flying foe; <br />
But bending his inevitable bow, <br />
Reach&#8217;d him in air, suspended as he stood; <br />
And in his pinion fix&#8217;d the feather&#8217;d wood. <br />
Light was the wound; but in the sinew hung <br />
The point, and his disabled wing unstrung. <br />
He wheel&#8217;d in air, and stretch&#8217;d his vans in vain; <br />
His vans no longer cou&#8217;d his flight sustain: <br />
For while one gather&#8217;d wind, one unsupply&#8217;d <br />
Hung drooping down, nor pois&#8217;d his other side. <br />
He fell: the shaft that slightly was impress&#8217;d, <br />
Now from his heavy fall with weight increas&#8217;d, <br />
Drove through his neck, aslant, he spurns the ground, <br />
And the soul issues through the weazon&#8217;s wound.</p>
<p>Now, brave commander of the Rhodian seas, <br />
What praise is due from me, to Hercules? <br />
Silence is all the vengeance I decree <br />
For my slain brothers; but &#8217;tis peace with thee.</p>
<p>Thus with a flowing tongue old Nestor spoke: <br />
Then, to full bowls each other they provoke: <br />
At length, with weariness, and wine oppress&#8217;d, <br />
They rise from table; and withdraw to rest.</p>
<p>The Death of Achilles</p>
<p>The sire of Cygnus, monarch of the main, <br />
Mean-time, laments his son, in battel slain, <br />
And vows the victor&#8217;s death; nor vows in vain. <br />
For nine long years the smother&#8217;d pain he bore <br />
(Achilles was not ripe for Fate before): <br />
Then when he saw the promis&#8217;d hour was near, <br />
He thus bespoke the God, that guides the year: <br />
Immortal offspring of my brother Jove; <br />
My brightest nephew, and whom best I love, <br />
Whose hands were join&#8217;d with mine, to raise the wall <br />
Of tott&#8217;ring Troy, now nodding to her fall, <br />
Dost thou not mourn our pow&#8217;r employ&#8217;d in vain; <br />
And the defenders of our city slain? <br />
To pass the rest, could noble Hector lie <br />
Unpity&#8217;d, drag&#8217;d around his native Troy? <br />
And yet the murd&#8217;rer lives: himself by far <br />
A greater plague, than all the wasteful war: <br />
He lives; the proud Pelides lives, to boast <br />
Our town destroy&#8217;d, our common labour lost. <br />
O, could I meet him! But I wish too late: <br />
To prove my trident is not in his Fate! <br />
But let him try (for that&#8217;s allow&#8217;d) thy dart, <br />
And pierce his only penetrable part.</p>
<p>Apollo bows to the superior throne; <br />
And to his uncle&#8217;s anger, adds his own. <br />
Then in a cloud involv&#8217;d, he takes his flight, <br />
Where Greeks, and Trojans mix&#8217;d in mortal fight; <br />
And found out Paris, lurking where he stood, <br />
And stain&#8217;d his arrows with plebeian blood: <br />
Phoebus to him alone the God confess&#8217;d, <br />
Then to the recreant knight, he thus address&#8217;d. <br />
Dost thou not blush, to spend thy shafts in vain <br />
On a degenerate, and ignoble train? <br />
If fame, or better vengeance be thy care, <br />
There aim: and, with one arrow, end the war.</p>
<p>He said; and shew&#8217;d from far the blazing shield <br />
And sword, which, but Achilles, none cou&#8217;d wield; <br />
And how he mov&#8217;d a God, and mow&#8217;d the standing field. <br />
The deity himself directs aright <br />
Th&#8217; invenom&#8217;d shaft; and wings the fatal flight.</p>
<p>Thus fell the foremost of the Grecian name; <br />
And he, the base adult&#8217;rer, boasts the fame. <br />
A spectacle to glad the Trojan train; <br />
And please old Priam, after Hector slain. <br />
If by a female hand he had foreseen <br />
He was to die, his wish had rather been <br />
The lance, and double ax of the fair warriour queen. <br />
And now the terror of the Trojan field, <br />
The Grecian honour, ornament, and shield, <br />
High on a pile, th&#8217; unconquer&#8217;d chief is plac&#8217;d, <br />
The God that arm&#8217;d him first, consum&#8217;d at last. <br />
Of all the mighty man, the small remains <br />
A little urn, and scarcely fill&#8217;d, contains. <br />
Yet great in Homer, still Achilles lives; <br />
And equal to himself, himself survives.</p>
<p>His buckler owns its former lord; and brings <br />
New cause of strife, betwixt contending kings; <br />
Who worthi&#8217;st after him, his sword to wield, <br />
Or wear his armour, or sustain his shield. <br />
Ev&#8217;n Diomede sat mute, with down-cast eyes; <br />
Conscious of wanted worth to win the prize: <br />
Nor Menelaus presum&#8217;d these arms to claim, <br />
Nor he the king of men, a greater name. <br />
Two rivals only rose: Laertes&#8217; son, <br />
And the vast bulk of Ajax Telamon: <br />
The king, who cherish&#8217;d each with equal love, <br />
And from himself all envy wou&#8217;d remove, <br />
Left both to be determin&#8217;d by the laws; <br />
And to the Graecian chiefs transferr&#8217;d the cause. </p>
