				<p>The Story of of Cadmus</p>
<p>When now Agenor had his daughter lost, <br />
He sent his son to search on ev&#8217;ry coast; <br />
And sternly bid him to his arms restore <br />
The darling maid, or see his face no more, <br />
But live an exile in a foreign clime; <br />
Thus was the father pious to a crime. <br />
The restless youth search&#8217;d all the world around; <br />
But how can Jove in his amours be found? <br />
When, tir&#8217;d at length with unsuccessful toil, <br />
To shun his angry sire and native soil, <br />
He goes a suppliant to the Delphick dome; <br />
There asks the God what new appointed home <br />
Should end his wand&#8217;rings, and his toils relieve. <br />
The Delphick oracles this answer give.</p>
<p>&#8220;Behold among the fields a lonely cow, <br />
Unworn with yokes, unbroken to the plow; <br />
Mark well the place where first she lays her down, <br />
There measure out thy walls, and build thy town, <br />
And from thy guide Boeotia call the land, <br />
In which the destin&#8217;d walls and town shall stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>No sooner had he left the dark abode, <br />
Big with the promise of the Delphick God, <br />
When in the fields the fatal cow he view&#8217;d, <br />
Nor gall&#8217;d with yokes, nor worn with servitude: <br />
Her gently at a distance he pursu&#8217;d; <br />
And as he walk&#8217;d aloof, in silence pray&#8217;d <br />
To the great Pow&#8217;r whose counsels he obey&#8217;d. <br />
Her way thro&#8217; flow&#8217;ry Panope she took, <br />
And now, Cephisus, cross&#8217;d thy silver brook; <br />
When to the Heav&#8217;ns her spacious front she rais&#8217;d, <br />
And bellow&#8217;d thrice, then backward turning gaz&#8217;d <br />
On those behind, &#8217;till on the destin&#8217;d place <br />
She stoop&#8217;d, and couch&#8217;d amid the rising grass.</p>
<p>Cadmus salutes the soil, and gladly hails <br />
The new-found mountains, and the nameless vales, <br />
And thanks the Gods, and turns about his eye <br />
To see his new dominions round him lye; <br />
Then sends his servants to a neighb&#8217;ring grove <br />
For living streams, a sacrifice to Jove. <br />
O&#8217;er the wide plain there rose a shady wood <br />
Of aged trees; in its dark bosom stood <br />
A bushy thicket, pathless and unworn, <br />
O&#8217;er-run with brambles, and perplex&#8217;d with thorn: <br />
Amidst the brake a hollow den was found, <br />
With rocks and shelving arches vaulted round.</p>
<p>Deep in the dreary den, conceal&#8217;d from day, <br />
Sacred to Mars, a mighty dragon lay, <br />
Bloated with poison to a monstrous size; <br />
Fire broke in flashes when he glanc&#8217;d his eyes: <br />
His tow&#8217;ring crest was glorious to behold, <br />
His shoulders and his sides were scal&#8217;d with gold; <br />
Three tongues he brandish&#8217;d when he charg&#8217;d his foes; <br />
His teeth stood jaggy in three dreadful rowes. <br />
The Tyrians in the den for water sought, <br />
And with their urns explor&#8217;d the hollow vault: <br />
From side to side their empty urns rebound, <br />
And rowse the sleeping serpent with the sound. <br />
Strait he bestirs him, and is seen to rise; <br />
And now with dreadful hissings fills the skies, <br />
And darts his forky tongues, and rowles his glaring eyes. <br />
The Tyrians drop their vessels in the fright, <br />
All pale and trembling at the hideous sight. <br />
Spire above spire uprear&#8217;d in air he stood, <br />
And gazing round him over-look&#8217;d the wood: <br />
Then floating on the ground in circles rowl&#8217;d; <br />
Then leap&#8217;d upon them in a mighty fold. <br />
Of such a bulk, and such a monstrous size <br />
The serpent in the polar circle lyes, <br />
That stretches over half the northern skies. <br />
In vain the Tyrians on their arms rely, <br />
In vain attempt to fight, in vain to fly: <br />
All their endeavours and their hopes are vain; <br />
Some die entangled in the winding train; <br />
Some are devour&#8217;d, or feel a loathsom death, <br />
Swoln up with blasts of pestilential breath.</p>
<p>And now the scorching sun was mounted high, <br />
In all its lustre, to the noon-day sky; <br />
When, anxious for his friends, and fill&#8217;d with cares, <br />
To search the woods th&#8217; impatient chief prepares. <br />
A lion&#8217;s hide around his loins he wore, <br />
The well poiz&#8217;d javelin to the field he bore, <br />
Inur&#8217;d to blood; the far-destroying dart; <br />
And, the best weapon, an undaunted heart.</p>
<p>Soon as the youth approach&#8217;d the fatal place, <br />
He saw his servants breathless on the grass; <br />
The scaly foe amid their corps he view&#8217;d, <br />
Basking at ease, and feasting in their blood. <br />
&#8220;Such friends,&#8221; he cries, &#8220;deserv&#8217;d a longer date; <br />
But Cadmus will revenge or share their fate.&#8221; <br />
Then heav&#8217;d a stone, and rising to the throw, <br />
He sent it in a whirlwind at the foe: <br />
A tow&#8217;r, assaulted by so rude a stroke, <br />
With all its lofty battlements had shook; <br />
But nothing here th&#8217; unwieldy rock avails, <br />
Rebounding harmless from the plaited scales, <br />
That, firmly join&#8217;d, preserv&#8217;d him from a wound, <br />
With native armour crusted all around. <br />
With more success, the dart unerring flew, <br />
Which at his back the raging warriour threw; <br />
Amid the plaited scales it took its course, <br />
And in the spinal marrow spent its force. <br />
The monster hiss&#8217;d aloud, and rag&#8217;d in vain, <br />
And writh&#8217;d his body to and fro with pain; <br />
He bit the dart, and wrench&#8217;d the wood away; <br />
The point still buried in the marrow lay. <br />
And now his rage, increasing with his pain, <br />
Reddens his eyes, and beats in ev&#8217;ry vein; <br />
Churn&#8217;d in his teeth the foamy venom rose, <br />
Whilst from his mouth a blast of vapours flows, <br />
Such as th&#8217; infernal Stygian waters cast. <br />
The plants around him wither in the blast. <br />
Now in a maze of rings he lies enrowl&#8217;d, <br />
Now all unravel&#8217;d, and without a fold; <br />
Now, like a torrent, with a mighty force <br />
Bears down the forest in his boist&#8217;rous course. <br />
Cadmus gave back, and on the lion&#8217;s spoil <br />
Sustain&#8217;d the shock, then forc&#8217;d him to recoil; <br />
The pointed jav&#8217;lin warded off his rage: <br />
Mad with his pains, and furious to engage, <br />
The serpent champs the steel, and bites the spear, <br />
&#8216;Till blood and venom all the point besmear. <br />
But still the hurt he yet receiv&#8217;d was slight; <br />
For, whilst the champion with redoubled might <br />
Strikes home the jav&#8217;lin, his retiring foe <br />
Shrinks from the wound, and disappoints the blow.</p>
<p>The dauntless heroe still pursues his stroke, <br />
And presses forward, &#8217;till a knotty oak <br />
Retards his foe, and stops him in the rear; <br />
Full in his throat he plung&#8217;d the fatal spear, <br />
That in th&#8217; extended neck a passage found, <br />
And pierc&#8217;d the solid timber through the wound. <br />
Fix&#8217;d to the reeling trunk, with many a stroke <br />
Of his huge tail he lash&#8217;d the sturdy oak; <br />
&#8216;Till spent with toil, and lab&#8217;ring hard for breath, <br />
He now lay twisting in the pangs of death.</p>
<p>Cadmus beheld him wallow in a flood <br />
Of swimming poison, intermix&#8217;d with blood; <br />
When suddenly a speech was heard from high <br />
(The speech was heard, nor was the speaker nigh), <br />
&#8220;Why dost thou thus with secret pleasure see, <br />
Insulting man! what thou thy self shalt be?&#8221; <br />
Astonish&#8217;d at the voice, he stood amaz&#8217;d, <br />
And all around with inward horror gaz&#8217;d: <br />
When Pallas swift descending from the skies, <br />
Pallas, the guardian of the bold and wise, <br />
Bids him plow up the field, and scatter round <br />
The dragon&#8217;s teeth o&#8217;er all the furrow&#8217;d ground; <br />
Then tells the youth how to his wond&#8217;ring eyes <br />
Embattled armies from the field should rise.</p>
<p>He sows the teeth at Pallas&#8217;s command, <br />
And flings the future people from his hand. <br />
The clods grow warm, and crumble where he sows; <br />
And now the pointed spears advance in rows; <br />
Now nodding plumes appear, and shining crests, <br />
Now the broad shoulders and the rising breasts; <br />
O&#8217;er all the field the breathing harvest swarms, <br />
A growing host, a crop of men and arms.</p>
<p>So through the parting stage a figure rears <br />
Its body up, and limb by limb appears <br />
By just degrees; &#8217;till all the man arise, <br />
And in his full proportion strikes the eyes.</p>
<p>Cadmus surpriz&#8217;d, and startled at the sight <br />
Of his new foes, prepar&#8217;d himself for fight: <br />
When one cry&#8217;d out, &#8220;Forbear, fond man, forbear <br />
To mingle in a blind promiscuous war.&#8221; <br />
This said, he struck his brother to the ground, <br />
Himself expiring by another&#8217;s wound; <br />
Nor did the third his conquest long survive, <br />
Dying ere scarce he had begun to live.</p>
<p>The dire example ran through all the field, <br />
&#8216;Till heaps of brothers were by brothers kill&#8217;d; <br />
The furrows swam in blood: and only five <br />
Of all the vast increase were left alive. <br />
Echion one, at Pallas&#8217;s command, <br />
Let fall the guiltless weapon from his hand, <br />
And with the rest a peaceful treaty makes, <br />
Whom Cadmus as his friends and partners takes; <br />
So founds a city on the promis&#8217;d earth, <br />
And gives his new Boeotian empire birth.</p>
<p>Here Cadmus reign&#8217;d; and now one would have guess&#8217;d <br />
The royal founder in his exile blest: <br />
Long did he live within his new abodes, <br />
Ally&#8217;d by marriage to the deathless Gods; <br />
And, in a fruitful wife&#8217;s embraces old, <br />
A long increase of children&#8217;s children told: <br />
But no frail man, however great or high, <br />
Can be concluded blest before he die.</p>
<p>Actaeon was the first of all his race, <br />
Who griev&#8217;d his grandsire in his borrow&#8217;d face; <br />
Condemn&#8217;d by stern Diana to bemoan <br />
The branching horns, and visage not his own; <br />
To shun his once lov&#8217;d dogs, to bound away, <br />
And from their huntsman to become their prey, <br />
And yet consider why the change was wrought, <br />
You&#8217;ll find it his misfortune, not his fault; <br />
Or, if a fault, it was the fault of chance: <br />
For how can guilt proceed from ignorance?</p>
<p>The Transformation of Actaeon into a Stag</p>
<p>In a fair chace a shady mountain stood, <br />
Well stor&#8217;d with game, and mark&#8217;d with trails of blood; <br />
Here did the huntsmen, &#8217;till the heat of day, <br />
Pursue the stag, and load themselves with rey: <br />
When thus Actaeon calling to the rest: <br />
&#8220;My friends,&#8221; said he, &#8220;our sport is at the best, <br />
The sun is high advanc&#8217;d, and downward sheds <br />
His burning beams directly on our heads; <br />
Then by consent abstain from further spoils, <br />
Call off the dogs, and gather up the toils, <br />
And ere to-morrow&#8217;s sun begins his race, <br />
Take the cool morning to renew the chace.&#8221; <br />
They all consent, and in a chearful train <br />
The jolly huntsmen, loaden with the slain, <br />
Return in triumph from the sultry plain.</p>
<p>Down in a vale with pine and cypress clad, <br />
Refresh&#8217;d with gentle winds, and brown with shade, <br />
The chaste Diana&#8217;s private haunt, there stood <br />
Full in the centre of the darksome wood <br />
A spacious grotto, all around o&#8217;er-grown <br />
With hoary moss, and arch&#8217;d with pumice-stone. <br />
From out its rocky clefts the waters flow, <br />
And trickling swell into a lake below. <br />
Nature had ev&#8217;ry where so plaid her part, <br />
That ev&#8217;ry where she seem&#8217;d to vie with art. <br />
Here the bright Goddess, toil&#8217;d and chaf&#8217;d with heat, <br />
Was wont to bathe her in the cool retreat.</p>
<p>Here did she now with all her train resort, <br />
Panting with heat, and breathless from the sport; <br />
Her armour-bearer laid her bow aside, <br />
Some loos&#8217;d her sandals, some her veil unty&#8217;d; <br />
Each busy nymph her proper part undrest; <br />
While Crocale, more handy than the rest, <br />
Gather&#8217;d her flowing hair, and in a noose <br />
Bound it together, whilst her own hung loose. <br />
Five of the more ignoble sort by turns <br />
Fetch up the water, and unlade the urns.</p>
<p>Now all undrest the shining Goddess stood, <br />
When young Actaeon, wilder&#8217;d in the wood, <br />
To the cool grott by his hard fate betray&#8217;d, <br />
The fountains fill&#8217;d with naked nymphs survey&#8217;d. <br />
The frighted virgins shriek&#8217;d at the surprize <br />
(The forest echo&#8217;d with their piercing cries). <br />
Then in a huddle round their Goddess prest: <br />
She, proudly eminent above the rest, <br />
With blushes glow&#8217;d; such blushes as adorn <br />
The ruddy welkin, or the purple morn; <br />
And tho&#8217; the crowding nymphs her body hide, <br />
Half backward shrunk, and view&#8217;d him from a side. <br />
Surpriz&#8217;d, at first she would have snatch&#8217;d her bow, <br />
But sees the circling waters round her flow; <br />
These in the hollow of her hand she took, <br />
And dash&#8217;d &#8216;em in his face, while thus she spoke: <br />
&#8220;Tell, if thou can&#8217;st, the wond&#8217;rous sight disclos&#8217;d, <br />
A Goddess naked to thy view expos&#8217;d.&#8221;</p>
<p>This said, the man begun to disappear <br />
By slow degrees, and ended in a deer. <br />
A rising horn on either brow he wears, <br />
And stretches out his neck, and pricks his ears; <br />
Rough is his skin, with sudden hairs o&#8217;er-grown, <br />
His bosom pants with fears before unknown: <br />
Transform&#8217;d at length, he flies away in haste, <br />
And wonders why he flies away so fast. <br />
But as by chance, within a neighb&#8217;ring brook, <br />
He saw his branching horns and alter&#8217;d look. <br />
Wretched Actaeon! in a doleful tone <br />
He try&#8217;d to speak, but only gave a groan; <br />
And as he wept, within the watry glass <br />
He saw the big round drops, with silent pace, <br />
Run trickling down a savage hairy face. <br />
What should he do? Or seek his old abodes, <br />
Or herd among the deer, and sculk in woods! <br />
Here shame dissuades him, there his fear prevails, <br />
And each by turns his aking heart assails.</p>
<p>As he thus ponders, he behind him spies <br />
His op&#8217;ning hounds, and now he hears their cries: <br />
A gen&#8217;rous pack, or to maintain the chace, <br />
Or snuff the vapour from the scented grass.</p>
<p>He bounded off with fear, and swiftly ran <br />
O&#8217;er craggy mountains, and the flow&#8217;ry plain; <br />
Through brakes and thickets forc&#8217;d his way, and flew <br />
Through many a ring, where once he did pursue. <br />
In vain he oft endeavour&#8217;d to proclaim <br />
His new misfortune, and to tell his name; <br />
Nor voice nor words the brutal tongue supplies; <br />
From shouting men, and horns, and dogs he flies, <br />
Deafen&#8217;d and stunn&#8217;d with their promiscuous cries. <br />
When now the fleetest of the pack, that prest <br />
Close at his heels, and sprung before the rest, <br />
Had fasten&#8217;d on him, straight another pair, <br />
Hung on his wounded haunch, and held him there, <br />
&#8216;Till all the pack came up, and ev&#8217;ry hound <br />
Tore the sad huntsman grov&#8217;ling on the ground, <br />
Who now appear&#8217;d but one continu&#8217;d wound. <br />
With dropping tears his bitter fate he moans, <br />
And fills the mountain with his dying groans. <br />
His servants with a piteous look he spies, <br />
And turns about his supplicating eyes. <br />
His servants, ignorant of what had chanc&#8217;d, <br />
With eager haste and joyful shouts advanc&#8217;d, <br />
And call&#8217;d their lord Actaeon to the game. <br />
He shook his head in answer to the name; <br />
He heard, but wish&#8217;d he had indeed been gone, <br />
Or only to have stood a looker-on. <br />
But to his grief he finds himself too near, <br />
And feels his rav&#8217;nous dogs with fury tear <br />
Their wretched master panting in a deer.</p>
<p>The Birth of Bacchus</p>
<p>Actaeon&#8217;s suff&#8217;rings, and Diana&#8217;s rage, <br />
Did all the thoughts of men and Gods engage; <br />
Some call&#8217;d the evils which Diana wrought, <br />
Too great, and disproportion&#8217;d to the fault: <br />
Others again, esteem&#8217;d Actaeon&#8217;s woes <br />
Fit for a virgin Goddess to impose. <br />
The hearers into diff&#8217;rent parts divide, <br />
And reasons are produc&#8217;d on either side.</p>
<p>Juno alone, of all that heard the news, <br />
Nor would condemn the Goddess, nor excuse: <br />
She heeded not the justice of the deed, <br />
But joy&#8217;d to see the race of Cadmus bleed; <br />
For still she kept Europa in her mind, <br />
And, for her sake, detested all her kind. <br />
Besides, to aggravate her hate, she heard <br />
How Semele, to Jove&#8217;s embrace preferr&#8217;d, <br />
Was now grown big with an immortal load, <br />
And carry&#8217;d in her womb a future God. <br />
Thus terribly incens&#8217;d, the Goddess broke <br />
To sudden fury, and abruptly spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are my reproaches of so small a force? <br />
&#8216;Tis time I then pursue another course: <br />
It is decreed the guilty wretch shall die, <br />
If I&#8217;m indeed the mistress of the sky, <br />
If rightly styl&#8217;d among the Pow&#8217;rs above <br />
The wife and sister of the thund&#8217;ring Jove <br />
(And none can sure a sister&#8217;s right deny); <br />
It is decreed the guilty wretch shall die. <br />
She boasts an honour I can hardly claim, <br />
Pregnant she rises to a mother&#8217;s name; <br />
While proud and vain she triumphs in her Jove, <br />
And shows the glorious tokens of his love: <br />
But if I&#8217;m still the mistress of the skies, <br />
By her own lover the fond beauty dies.&#8221; <br />
This said, descending in a yellow cloud, <br />
Before the gates of Semele she stood.</p>
<p>Old Beroe&#8217;s decrepit shape she wears, <br />
Her wrinkled visage, and her hoary hairs; <br />
Whilst in her trembling gait she totters on, <br />
And learns to tattle in the nurse&#8217;s tone. <br />
The Goddess, thus disguis&#8217;d in age, beguil&#8217;d <br />
With pleasing stories her false foster-child. <br />
Much did she talk of love, and when she came <br />
To mention to the nymph her lover&#8217;s name, <br />
Fetching a sigh, and holding down her head, <br />
&#8220;&#8216;Tis well,&#8221; says she, &#8220;if all be true that&#8217;s said. <br />
But trust me, child, I&#8217;m much inclin&#8217;d to fear <br />
Some counterfeit in this your Jupiter: <br />
Many an honest well-designing maid <br />
Has been by these pretended Gods betray&#8217;d, <br />
But if he be indeed the thund&#8217;ring Jove, <br />
Bid him, when next he courts the rites of love, <br />
Descend triumphant from th&#8217; etherial sky, <br />
In all the pomp of his divinity, <br />
Encompass&#8217;d round by those celestial charms, <br />
With which he fills th&#8217; immortal Juno&#8217;s arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Th&#8217; unwary nymph, ensnar&#8217;d with what she said, <br />
Desir&#8217;d of Jove, when next he sought her bed, <br />
To grant a certain gift which she would chuse; <br />
&#8220;Fear not,&#8221; reply&#8217;d the God, &#8220;that I&#8217;ll refuse <br />
Whate&#8217;er you ask: may Styx confirm my voice, <br />
Chuse what you will, and you shall have your choice.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Then,&#8221; says the nymph, &#8220;when next you seek my arms, <br />
May you descend in those celestial charms, <br />
With which your Juno&#8217;s bosom you enflame, <br />
And fill with transport Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s immortal dame.&#8221; <br />
The God surpriz&#8217;d would fain have stopp&#8217;d her voice, <br />
But he had sworn, and she had made her choice.</p>
<p>To keep his promise he ascends, and shrowds <br />
His awful brow in whirl-winds and in clouds; <br />
Whilst all around, in terrible array, <br />
His thunders rattle, and his light&#8217;nings play. <br />
And yet, the dazling lustre to abate, <br />
He set not out in all his pomp and state, <br />
Clad in the mildest light&#8217;ning of the skies, <br />
And arm&#8217;d with thunder of the smallest size: <br />
Not those huge bolts, by which the giants slain <br />
Lay overthrown on the Phlegrean plain. <br />
&#8216;Twas of a lesser mould, and lighter weight; <br />
They call it thunder of a second-rate, <br />
For the rough Cyclops, who by Jove&#8217;s command <br />
Temper&#8217;d the bolt, and turn&#8217;d it to his hand, <br />
Work&#8217;d up less flame and fury in its make, <br />
And quench&#8217;d it sooner in the standing lake. <br />
Thus dreadfully adorn&#8217;d, with horror bright, <br />
Th&#8217; illustrious God, descending from his height, <br />
Came rushing on her in a storm of light.</p>
<p>The mortal dame, too feeble to engage <br />
The lightning&#8217;s flashes, and the thunder&#8217;s rage, <br />
Consum&#8217;d amidst the glories she desir&#8217;d, <br />
And in the terrible embrace expir&#8217;d.</p>
<p>But, to preserve his offspring from the tomb, <br />
Jove took him smoaking from the blasted womb: <br />
And, if on ancient tales we may rely, <br />
Inclos&#8217;d th&#8217; abortive infant in his thigh. <br />
Here when the babe had all his time fulfill&#8217;d, <br />
Ino first took him for her foster-child; <br />
Then the Niseans, in their dark abode, <br />
Nurs&#8217;d secretly with milk the thriving God.</p>
<p>The Transformation of Tiresias</p>
<p>&#8216;Twas now, while these transactions past on Earth, <br />
And Bacchus thus procur&#8217;d a second birth, <br />
When Jove, dispos&#8217;d to lay aside the weight <br />
Of publick empire and the cares of state, <br />
As to his queen in nectar bowls he quaff&#8217;d, <br />
&#8220;In troth,&#8221; says he, and as he spoke he laugh&#8217;d, <br />
&#8220;The sense of pleasure in the male is far <br />
More dull and dead, than what you females share.&#8221; <br />
Juno the truth of what was said deny&#8217;d; <br />
Tiresias therefore must the cause decide, <br />
For he the pleasure of each sex had try&#8217;d.</p>
<p>It happen&#8217;d once, within a shady wood, <br />
Two twisted snakes he in conjunction view&#8217;d, <br />
When with his staff their slimy folds he broke, <br />
And lost his manhood at the fatal stroke. <br />
But, after seven revolving years, he view&#8217;d <br />
The self-same serpents in the self-same wood: <br />
&#8220;And if,&#8221; says he, &#8220;such virtue in you lye, <br />
That he who dares your slimy folds untie <br />
Must change his kind, a second stroke I&#8217;ll try.&#8221; <br />
Again he struck the snakes, and stood again <br />
New-sex&#8217;d, and strait recover&#8217;d into man. <br />
Him therefore both the deities create <br />
The sov&#8217;raign umpire, in their grand debate; <br />
And he declar&#8217;d for Jove: when Juno fir&#8217;d, <br />
More than so trivial an affair requir&#8217;d, <br />
Depriv&#8217;d him, in her fury, of his sight, <br />
And left him groping round in sudden night. <br />
But Jove (for so it is in Heav&#8217;n decreed, <br />
That no one God repeal another&#8217;s deed) <br />
Irradiates all his soul with inward light, <br />
And with the prophet&#8217;s art relieves the want of sight.</p>
<p>The Transformation of Echo</p>
<p>Fam&#8217;d far and near for knowing things to come, <br />
From him th&#8217; enquiring nations sought their doom; <br />
The fair Liriope his answers try&#8217;d, <br />
And first th&#8217; unerring prophet justify&#8217;d. <br />
This nymph the God Cephisus had abus&#8217;d, <br />
With all his winding waters circumfus&#8217;d, <br />
And on the Nereid got a lovely boy, <br />
Whom the soft maids ev&#8217;n then beheld with joy.</p>
<p>The tender dame, sollicitous to know <br />
Whether her child should reach old age or no, <br />
Consults the sage Tiresias, who replies, <br />
&#8220;If e&#8217;er he knows himself he surely dies.&#8221; <br />
Long liv&#8217;d the dubious mother in suspence, <br />
&#8216;Till time unriddled all the prophet&#8217;s sense.</p>
<p>Narcissus now his sixteenth year began, <br />
Just turn&#8217;d of boy, and on the verge of man; <br />
Many a friend the blooming youth caress&#8217;d, <br />
Many a love-sick maid her flame confess&#8217;d: <br />
Such was his pride, in vain the friend caress&#8217;d, <br />
The love-sick maid in vain her flame confess&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Once, in the woods, as he pursu&#8217;d the chace, <br />
The babbling Echo had descry&#8217;d his face; <br />
She, who in others&#8217; words her silence breaks, <br />
Nor speaks her self but when another speaks. <br />
Echo was then a maid, of speech bereft, <br />
Of wonted speech; for tho&#8217; her voice was left, <br />
Juno a curse did on her tongue impose, <br />
To sport with ev&#8217;ry sentence in the close. <br />
Full often when the Goddess might have caught <br />
Jove and her rivals in the very fault, <br />
This nymph with subtle stories would delay <br />
Her coming, &#8217;till the lovers slip&#8217;d away. <br />
The Goddess found out the deceit in time, <br />
And then she cry&#8217;d, &#8220;That tongue, for this thy crime, <br />
Which could so many subtle tales produce, <br />
Shall be hereafter but of little use.&#8221; <br />
Hence &#8217;tis she prattles in a fainter tone, <br />
With mimick sounds, and accents not her own.</p>
<p>This love-sick virgin, over-joy&#8217;d to find <br />
The boy alone, still follow&#8217;d him behind: <br />
When glowing warmly at her near approach, <br />
As sulphur blazes at the taper&#8217;s touch, <br />
She long&#8217;d her hidden passion to reveal, <br />
And tell her pains, but had not words to tell: <br />
She can&#8217;t begin, but waits for the rebound, <br />
To catch his voice, and to return the sound.</p>
<p>The nymph, when nothing could Narcissus move, <br />
Still dash&#8217;d with blushes for her slighted love, <br />
Liv&#8217;d in the shady covert of the woods, <br />
In solitary caves and dark abodes; <br />
Where pining wander&#8217;d the rejected fair, <br />
&#8216;Till harrass&#8217;d out, and worn away with care, <br />
The sounding skeleton, of blood bereft, <br />
Besides her bones and voice had nothing left. <br />
Her bones are petrify&#8217;d, her voice is found <br />
In vaults, where still it doubles ev&#8217;ry sound.</p>
<p>The Story of Narcissus</p>
<p>Thus did the nymphs in vain caress the boy, <br />
He still was lovely, but he still was coy; <br />
When one fair virgin of the slighted train <br />
Thus pray&#8217;d the Gods, provok&#8217;d by his disdain, <br />
&#8220;Oh may he love like me, and love like me in vain!&#8221; <br />
Rhamnusia pity&#8217;d the neglected fair, <br />
And with just vengeance answer&#8217;d to her pray&#8217;r.</p>
<p>There stands a fountain in a darksom wood, <br />
Nor stain&#8217;d with falling leaves nor rising mud; <br />
Untroubled by the breath of winds it rests, <br />
Unsully&#8217;d by the touch of men or beasts; <br />
High bow&#8217;rs of shady trees above it grow, <br />
And rising grass and chearful greens below. <br />
Pleas&#8217;d with the form and coolness of the place, <br />
And over-heated by the morning chace, <br />
Narcissus on the grassie verdure lyes: <br />
But whilst within the chrystal fount he tries <br />
To quench his heat, he feels new heats arise. <br />
For as his own bright image he survey&#8217;d, <br />
He fell in love with the fantastick shade; <br />
And o&#8217;er the fair resemblance hung unmov&#8217;d, <br />
Nor knew, fond youth! it was himself he lov&#8217;d. <br />
The well-turn&#8217;d neck and shoulders he descries, <br />
The spacious forehead, and the sparkling eyes; <br />
The hands that Bacchus might not scorn to show, <br />
And hair that round Apollo&#8217;s head might flow; <br />
With all the purple youthfulness of face, <br />
That gently blushes in the wat&#8217;ry glass. <br />
By his own flames consum&#8217;d the lover lyes, <br />
And gives himself the wound by which he dies. <br />
To the cold water oft he joins his lips, <br />
Oft catching at the beauteous shade he dips <br />
His arms, as often from himself he slips. <br />
Nor knows he who it is his arms pursue <br />
With eager clasps, but loves he knows not who.</p>
<p>What could, fond youth, this helpless passion move? <br />
What kindled in thee this unpity&#8217;d love? <br />
Thy own warm blush within the water glows, <br />
With thee the colour&#8217;d shadow comes and goes, <br />
Its empty being on thy self relies; <br />
Step thou aside, and the frail charmer dies.</p>
<p>Still o&#8217;er the fountain&#8217;s wat&#8217;ry gleam he stood, <br />
Mindless of sleep, and negligent of food; <br />
Still view&#8217;d his face, and languish&#8217;d as he view&#8217;d. <br />
At length he rais&#8217;d his head, and thus began <br />
To vent his griefs, and tell the woods his pain. <br />
&#8220;You trees,&#8221; says he, &#8220;and thou surrounding grove, <br />
Who oft have been the kindly scenes of love, <br />
Tell me, if e&#8217;er within your shades did lye <br />
A youth so tortur&#8217;d, so perplex&#8217;d as I? <br />
I, who before me see the charming fair, <br />
Whilst there he stands, and yet he stands not there: <br />
In such a maze of love my thoughts are lost: <br />
And yet no bulwark&#8217;d town, nor distant coast, <br />
Preserves the beauteous youth from being seen, <br />
No mountains rise, nor oceans flow between. <br />
A shallow water hinders my embrace; <br />
And yet the lovely mimick wears a face <br />
That kindly smiles, and when I bend to join <br />
My lips to his, he fondly bends to mine. <br />
Hear, gentle youth, and pity my complaint, <br />
Come from thy well, thou fair inhabitant. <br />
My charms an easy conquest have obtain&#8217;d <br />
O&#8217;er other hearts, by thee alone disdain&#8217;d. <br />
But why should I despair? I&#8217;m sure he burns <br />
With equal flames, and languishes by turns. <br />
When-e&#8217;er I stoop, he offers at a kiss, <br />
And when my arms I stretch, he stretches his. <br />
His eye with pleasure on my face he keeps, <br />
He smiles my smiles, and when I weep he weeps. <br />
When e&#8217;er I speak, his moving lips appear <br />
To utter something, which I cannot hear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah wretched me! I now begin too late <br />
To find out all the long-perplex&#8217;d deceit; <br />
It is my self I love, my self I see; <br />
The gay delusion is a part of me. <br />
I kindle up the fires by which I burn, <br />
And my own beauties from the well return. <br />
Whom should I court? how utter my complaint? <br />
Enjoyment but produces my restraint, <br />
And too much plenty makes me die for want. <br />
How gladly would I from my self remove! <br />
And at a distance set the thing I love. <br />
My breast is warm&#8217;d with such unusual fire, <br />
I wish him absent whom I most desire. <br />
And now I faint with grief; my fate draws nigh; <br />
In all the pride of blooming youth I die. <br />
Death will the sorrows of my heart relieve. <br />
Oh might the visionary youth survive, <br />
I should with joy my latest breath resign! <br />
But oh! I see his fate involv&#8217;d in mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>This said, the weeping youth again return&#8217;d <br />
To the clear fountain, where again he burn&#8217;d; <br />
His tears defac&#8217;d the surface of the well, <br />
With circle after circle, as they fell: <br />
And now the lovely face but half appears, <br />
O&#8217;er-run with wrinkles, and deform&#8217;d with tears. <br />
&#8220;Ah whither,&#8221; cries Narcissus, &#8220;dost thou fly? <br />
Let me still feed the flame by which I die; <br />
Let me still see, tho&#8217; I&#8217;m no further blest.&#8221; <br />
Then rends his garment off, and beats his breast: <br />
His naked bosom redden&#8217;d with the blow, <br />
In such a blush as purple clusters show, <br />
Ere yet the sun&#8217;s autumnal heats refine <br />
Their sprightly juice, and mellow it to wine. <br />
The glowing beauties of his breast he spies, <br />
And with a new redoubled passion dies. <br />
As wax dissolves, as ice begins to run, <br />
And trickle into drops before the sun; <br />
So melts the youth, and languishes away, <br />
His beauty withers, and his limbs decay; <br />
And none of those attractive charms remain, <br />
To which the slighted Echo su&#8217;d in vain.</p>
<p>She saw him in his present misery, <br />
Whom, spight of all her wrongs, she griev&#8217;d to see. <br />
She answer&#8217;d sadly to the lover&#8217;s moan, <br />
Sigh&#8217;d back his sighs, and groan&#8217;d to ev&#8217;ry groan: <br />
&#8220;Ah youth! belov&#8217;d in vain,&#8221; Narcissus cries; <br />
&#8220;Ah youth! belov&#8217;d in vain,&#8221; the nymph replies. <br />
&#8220;Farewel,&#8221; says he; the parting sound scarce fell <br />
From his faint lips, but she reply&#8217;d, &#8220;farewel.&#8221; <br />
Then on th&#8217; wholsome earth he gasping lyes, <br />
&#8216;Till death shuts up those self-admiring eyes. <br />
To the cold shades his flitting ghost retires, <br />
And in the Stygian waves it self admires.</p>
<p>For him the Naiads and the Dryads mourn, <br />
Whom the sad Echo answers in her turn; <br />
And now the sister-nymphs prepare his urn: <br />
When, looking for his corps, they only found <br />
A rising stalk, with yellow blossoms crown&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The Story of Pentheus</p>
<p>This sad event gave blind Tiresias fame, <br />
Through Greece establish&#8217;d in a prophet&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>Th&#8217; unhallow&#8217;d Pentheus only durst deride <br />
The cheated people, and their eyeless guide. <br />
To whom the prophet in his fury said, <br />
Shaking the hoary honours of his head: <br />
&#8220;&#8216;Twere well, presumptuous man, &#8217;twere well for thee <br />
If thou wert eyeless too, and blind, like me: <br />
For the time comes, nay, &#8217;tis already here, <br />
When the young God&#8217;s solemnities appear: <br />
Which, if thou dost not with just rites adorn, <br />
Thy impious carcass, into pieces torn, <br />
Shall strew the woods, and hang on ev&#8217;ry thorn. <br />
Then, then, remember what I now foretel, <br />
And own the blind Tiresias saw too well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still Pentheus scorns him, and derides his skill; <br />
But time did all the prophet&#8217;s threats fulfil. <br />
For now through prostrate Greece young Bacchus rode, <br />
Whilst howling matrons celebrate the God: <br />
All ranks and sexes to his Orgies ran, <br />
To mingle in the pomps, and fill the train. <br />
When Pentheus thus his wicked rage express&#8217;d: <br />
&#8220;What madness, Thebans, has your souls possess&#8217;d? <br />
Can hollow timbrels, can a drunken shout, <br />
And the lewd clamours of a beastly rout, <br />
Thus quell your courage; can the weak alarm <br />
Of women&#8217;s yells those stubborn souls disarm, <br />
Whom nor the sword nor trumpet e&#8217;er could fright, <br />
Nor the loud din and horror of a fight? <br />
And you, our sires, who left your old abodes, <br />
And fix&#8217;d in foreign earth your country Gods; <br />
Will you without a stroak your city yield, <br />
And poorly quit an undisputed field? <br />
But you, whose youth and vigour should inspire <br />
Heroick warmth, and kindle martial fire, <br />
Whom burnish&#8217;d arms and crested helmets grace, <br />
Not flow&#8217;ry garlands and a painted face; <br />
Remember him to whom you stand ally&#8217;d: <br />
The serpent for his well of waters dy&#8217;d. <br />
He fought the strong; do you his courage show, <br />
And gain a conquest o&#8217;er a feeble foe. <br />
If Thebes must fall, oh might the fates afford <br />
A nobler doom from famine, fire, or sword. <br />
Then might the Thebans perish with renown: <br />
But now a beardless victor sacks the town; <br />
Whom nor the prancing steed, nor pond&#8217;rous shield, <br />
Nor the hack&#8217;d helmet, nor the dusty field, <br />
But the soft joys of luxury and ease, <br />
The purple vests, and flow&#8217;ry garlands please. <br />
Stand then aside, I&#8217;ll make the counterfeit <br />
Renounce his god-head, and confess the cheat. <br />
Acrisius from the Grecian walls repell&#8217;d <br />
This boasted pow&#8217;r; why then should Pentheus yield? <br />
Go quickly drag th&#8217; impostor boy to me; <br />
I&#8217;ll try the force of his divinity.&#8221; <br />
Thus did th&#8217; audacious wretch those rites profane; <br />
His friends dissuade th&#8217; audacious wretch in vain: <br />
In vain his grandsire urg&#8217;d him to give o&#8217;er <br />
His impious threats; the wretch but raves the more.</p>
<p>So have I seen a river gently glide, <br />
In a smooth course, and inoffensive tide; <br />
But if with dams its current we restrain, <br />
It bears down all, and foams along the plain.</p>
<p>But now his servants came besmear&#8217;d with blood, <br />
Sent by their haughty prince to seize the God; <br />
The God they found not in the frantick throng, <br />
But dragg&#8217;d a zealous votary along.</p>
<p>The Mariners transform&#8217;d to Dolphins</p>
<p>Him Pentheus view&#8217;d with fury in his look, <br />
And scarce with-held his hands, whilst thus he spoke: <br />
&#8220;Vile slave! whom speedy vengeance shall pursue, <br />
And terrify thy base seditious crew: <br />
Thy country and thy parentage reveal, <br />
And, why thou joinest in these mad Orgies, tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captive views him with undaunted eyes, <br />
And, arm&#8217;d with inward innocence, replies,</p>
<p>&#8220;From high Meonia&#8217;s rocky shores I came, <br />
Of poor descent, Acoetes is my name: <br />
My sire was meanly born; no oxen plow&#8217;d <br />
His fruitful fields, nor in his pastures low&#8217;d. <br />
His whole estate within the waters lay; <br />
With lines and hooks he caught the finny prey, <br />
His art was all his livelyhood; which he <br />
Thus with his dying lips bequeath&#8217;d to me: <br />
In streams, my boy, and rivers take thy chance; <br />
There swims, said he, thy whole inheritance. <br />
Long did I live on this poor legacy; <br />
&#8216;Till tir&#8217;d with rocks, and my old native sky, <br />
To arts of navigation I inclin&#8217;d; <br />
Observ&#8217;d the turns and changes of the wind, <br />
Learn&#8217;d the fit havens, and began to note <br />
The stormy Hyades, the rainy Goat, <br />
The bright Taygete, and the shining Bears, <br />
With all the sailor&#8217;s catalogue of stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once, as by chance for Delos I design&#8217;d, <br />
My vessel, driv&#8217;n by a strong gust of wind, <br />
Moor&#8217;d in a Chian Creek; a-shore I went, <br />
And all the following night in Chios spent. <br />
When morning rose, I sent my mates to bring <br />
Supplies of water from a neighb&#8217;ring spring, <br />
Whilst I the motion of the winds explor&#8217;d; <br />
Then summon&#8217;d in my crew, and went aboard. <br />
Opheltes heard my summons, and with joy <br />
Brought to the shore a soft and lovely boy, <br />
With more than female sweetness in his look, <br />
Whom straggling in the neighb&#8217;ring fields he took. <br />
With fumes of wine the little captive glows, <br />
And nods with sleep, and staggers as he goes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I view&#8217;d him nicely, and began to trace <br />
Each heav&#8217;nly feature, each immortal grace, <br />
And saw divinity in all his face, <br />
I know not who, said I, this God should be; <br />
But that he is a God I plainly see: <br />
And thou, who-e&#8217;er thou art, excuse the force <br />
These men have us&#8217;d; and oh befriend our course! <br />
Pray not for us, the nimble Dictys cry&#8217;d, <br />
Dictys, that could the main-top mast bestride, <br />
And down the ropes with active vigour slide. <br />
To the same purpose old Epopeus spoke, <br />
Who over-look&#8217;d the oars, and tim&#8217;d the stroke; <br />
The same the pilot, and the same the rest; <br />
Such impious avarice their souls possest. <br />
Nay, Heav&#8217;n forbid that I should bear away <br />
Within my vessel so divine a prey, <br />
Said I; and stood to hinder their intent: <br />
When Lycabas, a wretch for murder sent <br />
From Tuscany, to suffer banishment, <br />
With his clench&#8217;d fist had struck me over-board, <br />
Had not my hands in falling grasp&#8217;d a cord.</p>
<p>&#8220;His base confederates the fact approve; <br />
When Bacchus (for &#8217;twas he) begun to move, <br />
Wak&#8217;d by the noise and clamours which they rais&#8217;d; <br />
And shook his drowsie limbs, and round him gaz&#8217;d: <br />
What means this noise? he cries; am I betray&#8217;d? <br />
Ah, whither, whither must I be convey&#8217;d? <br />
Fear not, said Proreus, child, but tell us where <br />
You wish to land, and trust our friendly care. <br />
To Naxos then direct your course, said he; <br />
Naxos a hospitable port shall be <br />
To each of you, a joyful home to me. <br />
By ev&#8217;ry God, that rules the sea or sky, <br />
The perjur&#8217;d villains promise to comply, <br />
And bid me hasten to unmoor the ship. <br />
With eager joy I launch into the deep; <br />
And, heedless of the fraud, for Naxos stand. <br />
They whisper oft, and beckon with the hand, <br />
And give me signs, all anxious for their prey, <br />
To tack about, and steer another way. <br />
Then let some other to my post succeed, <br />
Said I, I&#8217;m guiltless of so foul a deed. <br />
What, says Ethalion, must the ship&#8217;s whole crew <br />
Follow your humour, and depend on you? <br />
And strait himself he seated at the prore, <br />
And tack&#8217;d about, and sought another shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;The beauteous youth now found himself betray&#8217;d, <br />
And from the deck the rising waves survey&#8217;d, <br />
And seem&#8217;d to weep, and as he wept he said: <br />
And do you thus my easy faith beguile? <br />
Thus do you bear me to my native isle? <br />
Will such a multitude of men employ <br />
Their strength against a weak defenceless boy?</p>
<p>&#8220;In vain did I the God-like youth deplore, <br />
The more I begg&#8217;d, they thwarted me the more. <br />
And now by all the Gods in Heav&#8217;n that hear <br />
This solemn oath, by Bacchus&#8217; self, I swear, <br />
The mighty miracle that did ensue, <br />
Although it seems beyond belief, is true. <br />
The vessel, fix&#8217;d and rooted in the flood, <br />
Unmov&#8217;d by all the beating billows stood. <br />
In vain the mariners would plow the main <br />
With sails unfurl&#8217;d, and strike their oars in vain; <br />
Around their oars a twining ivy cleaves, <br />
And climbs the mast, and hides the cords in leaves: <br />
The sails are cover&#8217;d with a chearful green, <br />
And berries in the fruitful canvass seen. <br />
Amidst the waves a sudden forest rears <br />
Its verdant head, and a new Spring appears.</p>
<p>&#8220;The God we now behold with open&#8217;d eyes; <br />
A herd of spotted panthers round him lyes <br />
In glaring forms; the grapy clusters spread <br />
On his fair brows, and dangle on his head. <br />
And whilst he frowns, and brandishes his spear, <br />
My mates surpriz&#8217;d with madness or with fear, <br />
Leap&#8217;d over board; first perjur&#8217;d Madon found <br />
Rough scales and fins his stiff&#8217;ning sides surround; <br />
Ah what, cries one, has thus transform&#8217;d thy look? <br />
Strait his own mouth grew wider as he spoke; <br />
And now himself he views with like surprize. <br />
Still at his oar th&#8217; industrious Libys plies; <br />
But, as he plies, each busy arm shrinks in, <br />
And by degrees is fashion&#8217;d to a fin. <br />
Another, as he catches at a cord, <br />
Misses his arms, and, tumbling over-board, <br />
With his broad fins and forky tail he laves <br />
The rising surge, and flounces in the waves. <br />
Thus all my crew transform&#8217;d around the ship, <br />
Or dive below, or on the surface leap, <br />
And spout the waves, and wanton in the deep. <br />
Full nineteen sailors did the ship convey, <br />
A shole of nineteen dolphins round her play. <br />
I only in my proper shape appear, <br />
Speechless with wonder, and half dead with fear, <br />
&#8216;Till Bacchus kindly bid me fear no more. <br />
With him I landed on the Chian shore, <br />
And him shall ever gratefully adore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This forging slave,&#8221; says Pentheus, &#8220;would prevail <br />
O&#8217;er our just fury by a far-fetch&#8217;d tale: <br />
Go, let him feel the whips, the swords, the fire, <br />
And in the tortures of the rack expire.&#8221; <br />
Th&#8217; officious servants hurry him away, <br />
And the poor captive in a dungeon lay. <br />
But, whilst the whips and tortures are prepar&#8217;d, <br />
The gates fly open, of themselves unbarr&#8217;d; <br />
At liberty th&#8217; unfetter&#8217;d captive stands, <br />
And flings the loosen&#8217;d shackles from his hands.</p>
<p>The Death of Pentheus</p>
<p>But Pentheus, grown more furious than before, <br />
Resolv&#8217;d to send his messengers no more, <br />
But went himself to the distracted throng, <br />
Where high Cithaeron echo&#8217;d with their song. <br />
And as the fiery war-horse paws the ground, <br />
And snorts and trembles at the trumpet&#8217;s sound; <br />
Transported thus he heard the frantick rout, <br />
And rav&#8217;d and madden&#8217;d at the distant shout.</p>
<p>A spacious circuit on the hill there stood. <br />
Level and wide, and skirted round with wood; <br />
Here the rash Pentheus, with unhallow&#8217;d eyes, <br />
The howling dames and mystick Orgies spies. <br />
His mother sternly view&#8217;d him where he stood, <br />
And kindled into madness as she view&#8217;d: <br />
Her leafy jav&#8217;lin at her son she cast, <br />
And cries, &#8220;The boar that lays our country waste! <br />
The boar, my sisters! Aim the fatal dart, <br />
And strike the brindled monster to the heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pentheus astonish&#8217;d heard the dismal sound, <br />
And sees the yelling matrons gath&#8217;ring round; <br />
He sees, and weeps at his approaching fate, <br />
And begs for mercy, and repents too late. <br />
&#8220;Help, help! my aunt Autonoe,&#8221; he cry&#8217;d; <br />
&#8220;Remember, how your own Actaeon dy&#8217;d.&#8221; <br />
Deaf to his cries, the frantick matron crops <br />
One stretch&#8217;d-out arm, the other Ino lops. <br />
In vain does Pentheus to his mother sue, <br />
And the raw bleeding stumps presents to view: <br />
His mother howl&#8217;d; and, heedless of his pray&#8217;r, <br />
Her trembling hand she twisted in his hair, <br />
&#8220;And this,&#8221; she cry&#8217;d, &#8220;shall be Agave&#8217;s share,&#8221; <br />
When from the neck his struggling head she tore, <br />
And in her hands the ghastly visage bore. <br />
With pleasure all the hideous trunk survey; <br />
Then pull&#8217;d and tore the mangled limbs away, <br />
As starting in the pangs of death it lay, <br />
Soon as the wood its leafy honours casts, <br />
Blown off and scatter&#8217;d by autumnal blasts, <br />
With such a sudden death lay Pentheus slain, <br />
And in a thousand pieces strow&#8217;d the plain.</p>
<p>By so distinguishing a judgment aw&#8217;d, <br />
The Thebans tremble, and confess the God. </p>
