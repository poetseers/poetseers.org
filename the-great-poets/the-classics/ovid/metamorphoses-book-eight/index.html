				<p>The Story of Nisus and Scylla</p>
<p>Now shone the morning star in bright array, <br />
To vanquish night, and usher in the day: <br />
The wind veers southward, and moist clouds arise, <br />
That blot with shades the blue meridian skies. <br />
Cephalus feels with joy the kindly gales, <br />
His new allies unfurl the swelling sails; <br />
Steady their course, they cleave the yielding main, <br />
And, with a wish, th&#8217; intended harbour gain. <br />
Mean-while King Minos, on the Attick strand, <br />
Displays his martial skill, and wastes the land. <br />
His army lies encampt upon the plains, <br />
Before Alcathoe&#8217;s walls, where Nisus reigns; <br />
On whose grey head a lock of purple hue, <br />
The strength, and fortune of his kingdom, grew.</p>
<p>Six moons were gone, and past, when still from far <br />
Victoria hover&#8217;d o&#8217;er the doubtful war. <br />
So long, to both inclin&#8217;d, th&#8217; impartial maid <br />
Between &#8216;em both her equal wings display&#8217;d. <br />
High on the walls, by Phoebus vocal made, <br />
A turret of the palace rais&#8217;d its head; <br />
And where the God his tuneful harp resign&#8217;d. <br />
The sound within the stones still lay enshrin&#8217;d: <br />
Hither the daughter of the purple king <br />
Ascended oft, to hear its musick ring; <br />
And, striking with a pebble, wou&#8217;d release <br />
Th&#8217; enchanted notes, in times of happy peace. <br />
But now, from thence, the curious maid beheld <br />
Rough feats of arms, and combats of the field: <br />
And, since the siege was long, had learnt the name <br />
Of ev&#8217;ry chief, his character, and fame; <br />
Their arms, their horse, and quiver she descry&#8217;d, <br />
Nor cou&#8217;d the dress of war the warriour hide.</p>
<p>Europa&#8217;s son she knew above the rest, <br />
And more, than well became a virgin breast: <br />
In vain the crested morion veils his face, <br />
She thinks it adds a more peculiar grace: <br />
His ample shield, embost with burnish&#8217;d gold, <br />
Still makes the bearer lovelier to behold: <br />
When the tough jav&#8217;lin, with a whirl, he sends, <br />
His strength and skill the sighing maid commends; <br />
Or, when he strains to draw the circling bow, <br />
And his fine limbs a manly posture show, <br />
Compar&#8217;d with Phoebus, he performs so well, <br />
Let her be judge, and Minos shall excell.</p>
<p>But when the helm put off, display&#8217;d to sight, <br />
And set his features in an open light; <br />
When, vaulting to his seat, his steed he prest, <br />
Caparison&#8217;d in gold, and richly drest; <br />
Himself in scarlet sumptuously array&#8217;d, <br />
New passions rise, and fire the frantick maid. <br />
O happy spear! she cries, that feels his touch; <br />
Nay, ev&#8217;n the reins he holds are blest too much. <br />
Oh! were it lawful, she cou&#8217;d wing her way <br />
Thro&#8217; the stern hostile troops without dismay; <br />
Or throw her body to the distant ground, <br />
And in the Cretans happy camp be found. <br />
Wou&#8217;d Minos but desire it! she&#8217;d expose <br />
Her native country to her country&#8217;s foes; <br />
Unbar the gates, the town with flames infest, <br />
Or any thing that Minos shou&#8217;d request.</p>
<p>And as she sate, and pleas&#8217;d her longing sight, <br />
Viewing the king&#8217;s pavilion veil&#8217;d with white, <br />
Shou&#8217;d joy, or grief, she said, possess my breast, <br />
To see my country by a war opprest? <br />
I&#8217;m in suspense! For, tho&#8217; &#8217;tis grief to know <br />
I love a man that is declar&#8217;d my foe; <br />
Yet, in my own despite, I must approve <br />
That lucky war, which brought the man I love. <br />
Yet, were I tender&#8217;d as a pledge of peace, <br />
The cruelties of war might quickly cease. <br />
Oh! with what joy I&#8217;d wear the chains he gave! <br />
A patient hostage, and a willing slave. <br />
Thou lovely object! if the nymph that bare <br />
Thy charming person, were but half so fair; <br />
Well might a God her virgin bloom desire, <br />
And with a rape indulge his amorous fire. <br />
Oh! had I wings to glide along the air, <br />
To his dear tent I&#8217;d fly, and settle there: <br />
There tell my quality, confess my flame, <br />
And grant him any dowry that he&#8217;d name. <br />
All, all I&#8217;d give; only my native land, <br />
My dearest country, shou&#8217;d excepted stand, <br />
For, perish love, and all expected joys, <br />
E&#8217;re, with so base a thought, my soul complies. <br />
Yet, oft the vanquish&#8217;d some advantage find, <br />
When conquer&#8217;d by a noble, gen&#8217;rous mind. <br />
Brave Minos justly has the war begun, <br />
Fir&#8217;d with resentment for his murder&#8217;d son: <br />
The righteous Gods a righteous cause regard, <br />
And will, with victory, his arms reward: <br />
We must be conquer&#8217;d; and the captive&#8217;s fate <br />
Will surely seize us, tho&#8217; it seize us late. <br />
Why then shou&#8217;d love be idle, and neglect <br />
What Mars, by arms and perils, will effect? <br />
Oh! Prince, I dye, with anxious fear opprest, <br />
Lest some rash hand shou&#8217;d wound my charmer&#8217;s breast: <br />
For, if they saw, no barb&#8217;rous mind cou&#8217;d dare <br />
Against that lovely form to raise a spear.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m resolv&#8217;d, and fix&#8217;d in this decree, <br />
My father&#8217;s country shall my dowry be. <br />
Thus I prevent the loss of life and blood, <br />
And, in effect, the action must be good. <br />
Vain resolution! for, at ev&#8217;ry gate <br />
The trusty centinels, successive, wait: <br />
The keys my father keeps; ah! there&#8217;s my grief; <br />
&#8216;Tis he obstructs all hopes of my relief. <br />
Gods! that this hated light I&#8217;d never seen! <br />
Or, all my life, without a father been! <br />
But Gods we all may be; for those that dare, <br />
Are Gods, and Fortune&#8217;s chiefest favours share. <br />
The ruling Pow&#8217;rs a lazy pray&#8217;r detest, <br />
The bold adventurer succeeds the best. <br />
What other maid, inspir&#8217;d with such a flame, <br />
But wou&#8217;d take courage, and abandon shame? <br />
But wou&#8217;d, tho&#8217; ruin shou&#8217;d ensue, remove <br />
Whate&#8217;er oppos&#8217;d, and clear the way to love? <br />
This, shall another&#8217;s feeble passion dare? <br />
While I sit tame, and languish in despair: <br />
No; for tho&#8217; fire and sword before me lay, <br />
Impatient love thro&#8217; both shou&#8217;d force its way. <br />
Yet I have no such enemies to fear, <br />
My sole obstruction is my father&#8217;s hair; <br />
His purple lock my sanguine hope destroys, <br />
And clouds the prospect of my rising joys.</p>
<p>Whilst thus she spoke, amid the thick&#8217;ning air <br />
Night supervenes, the greatest nurse of care: <br />
And, as the Goddess spreads her sable wings, <br />
The virgin&#8217;s fears decay, and courage springs. <br />
The hour was come, when Man&#8217;s o&#8217;er-labour&#8217;d breast <br />
Surceas&#8217;d its care, by downy sleep possest: <br />
All things now hush&#8217;d, Scylla with silent tread <br />
Urg&#8217;d her approach to Nisus&#8217; royal bed: <br />
There, of the fatal lock (accursed theft!) <br />
She her unwitting father&#8217;s head bereft. <br />
In safe possession of her impious prey, <br />
Out at a postern gate she takes her way. <br />
Embolden&#8217;d, by the merit of the deed <br />
She traverses the adverse camp with speed, <br />
&#8216;Till Minos&#8217; tent she reach&#8217;d: the righteous king <br />
She thus bespoke, who shiver&#8217;d at the thing.</p>
<p>Behold th&#8217; effect of love&#8217;s resistless sway! <br />
I, Nisus&#8217; royal seed, to thee betray <br />
My country, and my Gods. For this strange task, <br />
Minos, no other boon but thee I ask. <br />
This purple lock, a pledge of love, receive; <br />
No worthless present, since in it I give <br />
My father&#8217;s head.- Mov&#8217;d at a crime so new, <br />
And with abhorrence fill&#8217;d, back Minos drew, <br />
Nor touch&#8217;d th&#8217; unhallow&#8217;d gift; but thus exclaim&#8217;d <br />
(With mein indignant, and with eyes inflam&#8217;d), <br />
Perdition seize thee, thou, thy kind&#8217;s disgrace! <br />
May thy devoted carcass find no place <br />
In earth, or air, or sea, by all out-cast! <br />
Shall Minos, with so foul a monster, blast <br />
His Cretan world, where cradled Jove was nurst? <br />
Forbid it Heav&#8217;n!- away, thou most accurst!</p>
<p>And now Alcathoe, its lord exchang&#8217;d, <br />
Was under Minos&#8217; domination rang&#8217;d. <br />
While the most equal king his care applies <br />
To curb the conquer&#8217;d, and new laws devise, <br />
The fleet, by his command, with hoisted sails, <br />
And ready oars, invites the murm&#8217;ring gales. <br />
At length the Cretan hero anchor weigh&#8217;d, <br />
Repaying, with neglect, th&#8217; abandon&#8217;d maid. <br />
Deaf to her cries, he furrows up the main: <br />
In vain she prays, sollicits him in vain.</p>
<p>And now she furious grows in wild despair, <br />
She wrings her hands, and throws aloft her hair. <br />
Where run&#8217;st thou? (thus she vents her deep distress) <br />
Why shun&#8217;st thou her that crown&#8217;d thee with success? <br />
Her, whose fond love to thee cou&#8217;d sacrifice <br />
Her country, and her parent, sacred ties! <br />
Can nor my love, nor proffer&#8217;d presents find <br />
A passage to thy heart, and make thee kind? <br />
Can nothing move thy pity? O ingrate, <br />
Can&#8217;st thou behold my lost, forlorn estate, <br />
And not be soften&#8217;d? Can&#8217;st thou throw off one <br />
Who has no refuge left but thee alone? <br />
Where shall I seek for comfort? whither fly? <br />
My native country does in ashes lye: <br />
Or were&#8217;t not so, my treason bars me there, <br />
And bids me wander. Shall I next repair <br />
To a wrong&#8217;d father, by my guilt undone?- <br />
Me all Mankind deservedly will shun. <br />
I, out of all the world, my self have thrown, <br />
To purchase an access to Crete alone; <br />
Which, since refus&#8217;d, ungen&#8217;rous man, give o&#8217;er <br />
To boast thy race; Europa never bore <br />
A thing so savage. Thee some tygress bred, <br />
On the bleak Syrt&#8217;s inhospitable bed; <br />
Or where Charybdis pours its rapid tide <br />
Tempestuous. Thou art not to Jove ally&#8217;d; <br />
Nor did the king of Gods thy mother meet <br />
Beneath a bull&#8217;s forg&#8217;d shape, and bear to Crete. <br />
That fable of thy glorious birth is feign&#8217;d; <br />
Some wild outrageous bull thy dam sustain&#8217;d. <br />
O father Nisus, now my death behold; <br />
Exult, o city, by my baseness sold: <br />
Minos, obdurate, has aveng&#8217;d ye all; <br />
But &#8217;twere more just by those I wrong&#8217;d to fall: <br />
For why shou&#8217;dst thou, who only didst subdue <br />
By my offending, my offence pursue? <br />
Well art thou matcht to one whose am&#8217;rous flame <br />
Too fiercely rag&#8217;d, for human-kind to tame; <br />
One who, within a wooden heifer thrust, <br />
Courted a low&#8217;ring bull&#8217;s mistaken lust; <br />
And, from whose monster-teeming womb, the Earth <br />
Receiv&#8217;d, what much it mourn&#8217;d, a bi-form birth. <br />
But what avails my plaints? the whistling wind, <br />
Which bears him far away, leaves them behind. <br />
Well weigh&#8217;d Pasiphae, when she prefer&#8217;d <br />
A bull to thee, more brutish than the herd. <br />
But ah! Time presses, and the labour&#8217;d oars <br />
To distance drive the fleet, and lose the less&#8217;ning shores. <br />
Think not, ungrateful man, the liquid way <br />
And threat&#8217;ning billows shall inforce my stay. <br />
I&#8217;ll follow thee in spite: My arms I&#8217;ll throw <br />
Around thy oars, or grasp thy crooked prow, <br />
And drag thro&#8217; drenching seas. Her eager tongue <br />
Had hardly clos&#8217;d the speech, when forth she sprung <br />
And prov&#8217;d the deep. Cupid with added force <br />
Recruits each nerve, and aids her wat&#8217;ry course. <br />
Soon she the ship attains, unwelcome guest; <br />
And, as with close embrace its sides she prest, <br />
A hawk from upper air came pouring down <br />
(&#8216;Twas Nisus cleft the sky with wings new grown). <br />
At Scylla&#8217;s head his horny bill he aims; <br />
She, fearful of the blow, the ship disclaims, <br />
Quitting her hold: and yet she fell not far, <br />
But wond&#8217;ring, finds her self sustain&#8217;d in air. <br />
Chang&#8217;d to a lark, she mottled pinions shook, <br />
And, from the ravish&#8217;d lock, the name of Ciris took.</p>
<p>The Labyrinth</p>
<p>Now Minos, landed on the Cretan shore, <br />
Performs his vows to Jove&#8217;s protecting pow&#8217;r; <br />
A hundred bullocks of the largest breed, <br />
With flowrets crown&#8217;d, before his altar bleed: <br />
While trophies of the vanquish&#8217;d, brought from far <br />
Adorn the palace with the spoils of war.</p>
<p>Mean-while the monster of a human-beast, <br />
His family&#8217;s reproach, and stain, increas&#8217;d. <br />
His double kind the rumour swiftly spread, <br />
And evidenc&#8217;d the mother&#8217;s beastly deed. <br />
When Minos, willing to conceal the shame <br />
That sprung from the reports of tatling Fame, <br />
Resolves a dark inclosure to provide, <br />
And, far from sight, the two-form&#8217;d creature hide.</p>
<p>Great Daedalus of Athens was the man <br />
That made the draught, and form&#8217;d the wondrous plan; <br />
Where rooms within themselves encircled lye, <br />
With various windings, to deceive the eye. <br />
As soft Maeander&#8217;s wanton current plays, <br />
When thro&#8217; the Phrygian fields it loosely strays; <br />
Backward and forward rouls the dimpl&#8217;d tide, <br />
Seeming, at once, two different ways to glide: <br />
While circling streams their former banks survey, <br />
And waters past succeeding waters see: <br />
Now floating to the sea with downward course, <br />
Now pointing upward to its ancient source, <br />
Such was the work, so intricate the place, <br />
That scarce the workman all its turns cou&#8217;d trace; <br />
And Daedalus was puzzled how to find <br />
The secret ways of what himself design&#8217;d.</p>
<p>These private walls the Minotaur include, <br />
Who twice was glutted with Athenian blood: <br />
But the third tribute more successful prov&#8217;d, <br />
Slew the foul monster, and the plague remov&#8217;d. <br />
When Theseus, aided by the virgin&#8217;s art, <br />
Had trac&#8217;d the guiding thread thro&#8217; ev&#8217;ry part, <br />
He took the gentle maid, that set him free, <br />
And, bound for Dias, cut the briny sea. <br />
There, quickly cloy&#8217;d, ungrateful, and unkind, <br />
Left his fair consort in the isle behind, <br />
Whom Bacchus saw, and straining in his arms <br />
Her rifled bloom, and violated charms, <br />
Resolves, for this, the dear engaging dame <br />
Shou&#8217;d shine for ever in the rolls of Fame; <br />
And bids her crown among the stars be plac&#8217;d, <br />
With an eternal constellation grac&#8217;d. <br />
The golden circlet mounts; and, as it flies, <br />
Its diamonds twinkle in the distant skies; <br />
There, in their pristin form, the gemmy rays <br />
Between Alcides, and the dragon blaze.</p>
<p>The Story of Daedalus and Icarus</p>
<p>In tedious exile now too long detain&#8217;d, <br />
Daedalus languish&#8217;d for his native land: <br />
The sea foreclos&#8217;d his flight; yet thus he said: <br />
Tho&#8217; Earth and water in subjection laid, <br />
O cruel Minos, thy dominion be, <br />
We&#8217;ll go thro&#8217; air; for sure the air is free. <br />
Then to new arts his cunning thought applies, <br />
And to improve the work of Nature tries. <br />
A row of quils in gradual order plac&#8217;d, <br />
Rise by degrees in length from first to last; <br />
As on a cliff th&#8217; ascending thicket grows, <br />
Or, different reeds the rural pipe compose. <br />
Along the middle runs a twine of flax, <br />
The bottom stems are joyn&#8217;d by pliant wax. <br />
Thus, well compact, a hollow bending brings <br />
The fine composure into real wings.</p>
<p>His boy, young Icarus, that near him stood, <br />
Unthinking of his fate, with smiles pursu&#8217;d <br />
The floating feathers, which the moving air <br />
Bore loosely from the ground, and wasted here and there. <br />
Or with the wax impertinently play&#8217;d, <br />
And with his childish tricks the great design delay&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The final master-stroke at last impos&#8217;d, <br />
And now, the neat machine compleatly clos&#8217;d; <br />
Fitting his pinions on, a flight he tries, <br />
And hung self-ballanc&#8217;d in the beaten skies. <br />
Then thus instructs his child: My boy, take care <br />
To wing your course along the middle air; <br />
If low, the surges wet your flagging plumes; <br />
If high, the sun the melting wax consumes: <br />
Steer between both: nor to the northern skies, <br />
Nor south Orion turn your giddy eyes; <br />
But follow me: let me before you lay <br />
Rules for the flight, and mark the pathless way. <br />
Then teaching, with a fond concern, his son, <br />
He took the untry&#8217;d wings, and fix&#8217;d &#8216;em on; <br />
But fix&#8217;d with trembling hands; and as he speaks, <br />
The tears roul gently down his aged cheeks. <br />
Then kiss&#8217;d, and in his arms embrac&#8217;d him fast, <br />
But knew not this embrace must be the last. <br />
And mounting upward, as he wings his flight, <br />
Back on his charge he turns his aking sight; <br />
As parent birds, when first their callow care <br />
Leave the high nest to tempt the liquid air. <br />
Then chears him on, and oft, with fatal art, <br />
Reminds the stripling to perform his part.</p>
<p>These, as the angler at the silent brook, <br />
Or mountain-shepherd leaning on his crook, <br />
Or gaping plowman, from the vale descries, <br />
They stare, and view &#8216;em with religious eyes, <br />
And strait conclude &#8216;em Gods; since none, but they, <br />
Thro&#8217; their own azure skies cou&#8217;d find a way.</p>
<p>Now Delos, Paros on the left are seen, <br />
And Samos, favour&#8217;d by Jove&#8217;s haughty queen; <br />
Upon the right, the isle Lebynthos nam&#8217;d, <br />
And fair Calymne for its honey fam&#8217;d. <br />
When now the boy, whose childish thoughts aspire <br />
To loftier aims, and make him ramble high&#8217;r, <br />
Grown wild, and wanton, more embolden&#8217;d flies <br />
Far from his guide, and soars among the skies. <br />
The soft&#8217;ning wax, that felt a nearer sun, <br />
Dissolv&#8217;d apace, and soon began to run. <br />
The youth in vain his melting pinions shakes, <br />
His feathers gone, no longer air he takes: <br />
Oh! Father, father, as he strove to cry, <br />
Down to the sea he tumbled from on high, <br />
And found his Fate; yet still subsists by fame, <br />
Among those waters that retain his name.</p>
<p>The father, now no more a father, cries, <br />
Ho Icarus! where are you? as he flies; <br />
Where shall I seek my boy? he cries again, <br />
And saw his feathers scatter&#8217;d on the main. <br />
Then curs&#8217;d his art; and fun&#8217;ral rites confer&#8217;d, <br />
Naming the country from the youth interr&#8217;d.</p>
<p>A partridge, from a neighb&#8217;ring stump, beheld <br />
The sire his monumental marble build; <br />
Who, with peculiar call, and flutt&#8217;ring wing, <br />
Chirpt joyful, and malicious seem&#8217;d to sing: <br />
The only bird of all its kind, and late <br />
Transform&#8217;d in pity to a feather&#8217;d state: <br />
From whence, O Daedalus, thy guilt we date.</p>
<p>His sister&#8217;s son, when now twelve years were past, <br />
Was, with his uncle, as a scholar plac&#8217;d; <br />
The unsuspecting mother saw his parts, <br />
And genius fitted for the finest arts. <br />
This soon appear&#8217;d; for when the spiny bone <br />
In fishes&#8217; backs was by the stripling known, <br />
A rare invention thence he learnt to draw, <br />
Fil&#8217;d teeth in ir&#8217;n, and made the grating saw. <br />
He was the first, that from a knob of brass <br />
Made two strait arms with widening stretch to pass; <br />
That, while one stood upon the center&#8217;s place, <br />
The other round it drew a circling space. <br />
Daedalus envy&#8217;d this, and from the top <br />
Of fair Minerva&#8217;s temple let him drop; <br />
Feigning, that, as he lean&#8217;d upon the tow&#8217;r, <br />
Careless he stoop&#8217;d too much, and tumbled o&#8217;er.</p>
<p>The Goddess, who th&#8217; ingenious still befriends, <br />
On this occasion her asssistance lends; <br />
His arms with feathers, as he fell, she veils, <br />
And in the air a new made bird he sails. <br />
The quickness of his genius, once so fleet, <br />
Still in his wings remains, and in his feet: <br />
Still, tho&#8217; transform&#8217;d, his ancient name he keeps, <br />
And with low flight the new-shorn stubble sweeps, <br />
Declines the lofty trees, and thinks it best <br />
To brood in hedge-rows o&#8217;er its humble nest; <br />
And, in remembrance of the former ill, <br />
Avoids the heights, and precipices still.</p>
<p>At length, fatigu&#8217;d with long laborious flights, <br />
On fair Sicilia&#8217;s plains the artist lights; <br />
Where Cocalus the king, that gave him aid, <br />
Was, for his kindness, with esteem repaid. <br />
Athens no more her doleful tribute sent, <br />
That hardship gallant Theseus did prevent; <br />
Their temples hung with garlands, they adore <br />
Each friendly God, but most Minerva&#8217;s pow&#8217;r: <br />
To her, to Jove, to all, their altars smoak, <br />
They each with victims, and perfumes invoke.</p>
<p>Now talking Fame, thro&#8217; every Grecian town, <br />
Had spread, immortal Theseus, thy renown. <br />
From him the neighb&#8217;ring nations in distress, <br />
In suppliant terms implore a kind redress.</p>
<p>The Story of Meleager and Atalanta</p>
<p>From him the Caledonians sought relief; <br />
Though valiant Meleagros was their chief. <br />
The cause, a boar, who ravag&#8217;d far and near: <br />
Of Cynthia&#8217;s wrath, th&#8217; avenging minister. <br />
For Oeneus with autumnal plenty bless&#8217;d, <br />
By gifts to Heav&#8217;n his gratitude express&#8217;d: <br />
Cull&#8217;d sheafs, to Ceres; to Lyaeus, wine; <br />
To Pan, and Pales, offer&#8217;d sheep and kine; <br />
And fat of olives, to Minerva&#8217;s shrine. <br />
Beginning from the rural Gods, his hand <br />
Was lib&#8217;ral to the Pow&#8217;rs of high command: <br />
Each deity in ev&#8217;ry kind was bless&#8217;d, <br />
&#8216;Till at Diana&#8217;s fane th&#8217; invidious honour ceas&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Wrath touches ev&#8217;n the Gods; the Queen of Night, <br />
Fir&#8217;d with disdain, and jealous of her right, <br />
Unhonour&#8217;d though I am, at least, said she, <br />
Not unreveng&#8217;d that impious act shall be. <br />
Swift as the word, she sped the boar away, <br />
With charge on those devoted fields to prey. <br />
No larger bulls th&#8217; Aegyptian pastures feed, <br />
And none so large Sicilian meadows breed: <br />
His eye-balls glare with fire suffus&#8217;d with blood; <br />
His neck shoots up a thick-set thorny wood; <br />
His bristled back a trench impal&#8217;d appears, <br />
And stands erected, like a field of spears; <br />
Froth fills his chaps, he sends a grunting sound, <br />
And part he churns, and part befoams the ground, <br />
For tusks with Indian elephants he strove, <br />
And Jove&#8217;s own thunder from his mouth he drove. <br />
He burns the leaves; the scorching blast invades <br />
The tender corn, and shrivels up the blades: <br />
Or suff&#8217;ring not their yellow beards to rear, <br />
He tramples down the spikes, and intercepts the year: <br />
In vain the barns expect their promis&#8217;d load, <br />
Nor barns at home, nor recks are heap&#8217;d abroad: <br />
In vain the hinds the threshing-floor prepare, <br />
And exercise their flail in empty air. <br />
With olives ever-green the ground is strow&#8217;d, <br />
And grapes ungather&#8217;d shed their gen&#8217;rous blood. <br />
Amid the fold he rages, nor the sheep <br />
Their shepherds, nor the grooms their bulls can keep.</p>
<p>From fields to walls the frighted rabble run, <br />
Nor think themselves secure within the town: <br />
&#8216;Till Meleagros, and his chosen crew, <br />
Contemn the danger, and the praise pursue. <br />
Fair Leda&#8217;s twins (in time to stars decreed) <br />
One fought on foot, one curb&#8217;d the fiery steed; <br />
Then issu&#8217;d forth fam&#8217;d Jason after these, <br />
Who mann&#8217;d the foremost ship that sail&#8217;d the seas; <br />
Then Theseus join&#8217;d with bold Perithous came; <br />
A single concord in a double name: <br />
The Thestian sons, Idas who swiftly ran, <br />
And Ceneus, once a woman, now a man. <br />
Lynceus, with eagle&#8217;s eyes, and lion&#8217;s heart; <br />
Leucippus, with his never-erring dart; <br />
Acastus, Phileus, Phoenix, Telamon, <br />
Echion, Lelix, and Eurytion, <br />
Achilles&#8217; father, and great Phocus&#8217; son; <br />
Dryas the fierce, and Hippasus the strong; <br />
With twice old Iolas, and Nestor then but young. <br />
Laertes active, and Ancaeus bold; <br />
Mopsus the sage, who future things foretold; <br />
And t&#8217; other seer, yet by his wife unsold. <br />
A thousand others of immortal fame; <br />
Among the rest, fair Atalanta came, <br />
Grace of the woods: a diamond buckle bound <br />
Her vest behind, that else had flow&#8217;d upon the ground, <br />
And shew&#8217;d her buskin&#8217;d legs; her head was bare, <br />
But for her native ornament of hair; <br />
Which in a simple knot was ty&#8217;d above, <br />
Sweet negligence! unheeded bait of love! <br />
Her sounding quiver, on her shoulder ty&#8217;d, <br />
One hand a dart, and one a bow supply&#8217;d. <br />
Such was her face, as in a nymph display&#8217;d <br />
A fair fierce boy, or in a boy betray&#8217;d <br />
The blushing beauties of a modest maid. <br />
The Caledonian chief at once the dame <br />
Beheld, at once his heart receiv&#8217;d the flame, <br />
With Heav&#8217;ns averse. O happy youth, he cry&#8217;d; <br />
For whom thy fates reserve so fair a bride! <br />
He sigh&#8217;d, and had no leisure more to say; <br />
His honour call&#8217;d his eyes another way, <br />
And forc&#8217;d him to pursue the now-neglected prey.</p>
<p>There stood a forest on a mountain&#8217;s brow, <br />
Which over-look&#8217;d the shaded plains below. <br />
No sounding ax presum&#8217;d those trees to bite; <br />
Coeval with the world, a venerable sight. <br />
The heroes there arriv&#8217;d, some spread around <br />
The toils; some search the footsteps on the ground: <br />
Some from the chains the faithful dogs unbound. <br />
Of action eager, and intent in thought, <br />
The chiefs their honourable danger sought: <br />
A valley stood below; the common drain <br />
Of waters from above, and falling rain: <br />
The bottom was a moist, and marshy ground, <br />
Whose edges were with bending oziers crown&#8217;d: <br />
The knotty bulrush next in order stood, <br />
And all within of reeds a trembling wood.</p>
<p>From hence the boar was rous&#8217;d, and sprung amain, <br />
Like lightning sudden, on the warrior train; <br />
Beats down the trees before him, shakes the ground. <br />
The forest echoes to the crackling sound; <br />
Shout the fierce youth, and clamours ring around. <br />
All stood with their protended spears prepar&#8217;d, <br />
With broad steel heads the brandish&#8217;d weapons glar&#8217;d. <br />
The beast impetuous with his tusks aside <br />
Deals glancing wounds; the fearful dogs divide: <br />
All spend their mouths aloof, but none abide. <br />
Echion threw the first, but miss&#8217;d his mark, <br />
And stuck his boar-spear on a maple&#8217;s bark. <br />
Then Jason; and his javelin seem&#8217;d to take, <br />
But fail&#8217;d with over-force, and whiz&#8217;d above his back. <br />
Mopsus was next; but e&#8217;er he threw, address&#8217;d <br />
To Phoebus, thus: O patron, help thy priest: <br />
If I adore, and ever have ador&#8217;d <br />
Thy pow&#8217;r divine, thy present aid afford; <br />
That I may reach the beast. The God allow&#8217;d <br />
His pray&#8217;r, and smiling, gave him what he cou&#8217;d: <br />
He reach&#8217;d the savage, but no blood he drew: <br />
Dian unarm&#8217;d the javelin, as it flew.</p>
<p>This chaf&#8217;d the boar, his nostrils flames expire, <br />
And his red eye-balls roul with living fire. <br />
Whirl&#8217;d from a sling, or from an engine thrown, <br />
Amid the foes, so flies a mighty stone, <br />
As flew the beast: the left wing put to flight, <br />
The chiefs o&#8217;er-born, he rushes on the right. <br />
Eupalamos and Pelagon he laid <br />
In dust, and next to death, but for their fellows&#8217; aid. <br />
Onesimus far&#8217;d worse, prepar&#8217;d to fly, <br />
The fatal fang drove deep within his thigh, <br />
And cut the nerves: the nerves no more sustain <br />
The bulk; the bulk unprop&#8217;d, falls headlong on the plain.</p>
<p>Nestor had fail&#8217;d the fall of Troy to see, <br />
But leaning on his lance, he vaulted on a tree; <br />
Then gath&#8217;ring up his feet, look&#8217;d down with fear, <br />
And thought his monstrous foe was still too near. <br />
Against a stump his tusk the monster grinds, <br />
And in the sharpen&#8217;d edge new vigour finds; <br />
Then, trusting to his arms, young Othrys found, <br />
And ranch&#8217;d his hips with one continu&#8217;d wound.</p>
<p>Now Leda&#8217;s twins, the future stars, appear; <br />
White were their habits, white their horses were: <br />
Conspicuous both, and both in act to throw, <br />
Their trembling lances brandish&#8217;d at the foe: <br />
Nor had they miss&#8217;d; but he to thickets fled, <br />
Conceal&#8217;d from aiming spears, not pervious to the steed. <br />
But Telamon rush&#8217;d in, and happ&#8217;d to meet <br />
A rising root, that held his fastned feet; <br />
So down he fell, whom, sprawling on the ground, <br />
His brother from the wooden gyves unbound.</p>
<p>Mean-time the virgin-huntress was not slow <br />
T&#8217; expel the shaft from her contracted bow: <br />
Beneath his ear the fastned arrow stood, <br />
And from the wound appear&#8217;d the trickling blood. <br />
She blush&#8217;d for joy: but Meleagros rais&#8217;d <br />
His voice with loud applause, and the fair archer prais&#8217;d. <br />
He was the first to see, and first to show <br />
His friends the marks of the successful blow. <br />
Nor shall thy valour want the praises due, <br />
He said; a virtuous envy seiz&#8217;d the crew. <br />
They shout; the shouting animates their hearts, <br />
And all at once employ their thronging darts: <br />
But out of order thrown, in air they joyn, <br />
And multitude makes frustrate the design. <br />
With both his hands the proud Ancaeus takes, <br />
And flourishes his double-biting ax: <br />
Then, forward to his fate, he took a stride <br />
Before the rest, and to his fellows cry&#8217;d, <br />
Give place, and mark the diff&#8217;rence, if you can, <br />
Between a woman warrior, and a man, <br />
The boar is doom&#8217;d; nor though Diana lend <br />
Her aid, Diana can her beast defend. <br />
Thus boasted he; then stretch&#8217;d, on tiptoe stood, <br />
Secure to make his empty promise good. <br />
But the more wary beast prevents the blow, <br />
And upward rips the groin of his audacious foe. <br />
Ancaeus falls; his bowels from the wound <br />
Rush out, and clotted blood distains the ground.</p>
<p>Perithous, no small portion of the war, <br />
Press&#8217;d on, and shook his lance: to whom from far <br />
Thus Theseus cry&#8217;d; O stay, my better part, <br />
My more than mistress; of my heart, the heart. <br />
The strong may fight aloof; Ancaeus try&#8217;d <br />
His force too near, and by presuming dy&#8217;d: <br />
He said, and while he spake his javelin threw, <br />
Hissing in air th&#8217; unerring weapon flew; <br />
But on an arm of oak, that stood betwixt <br />
The marks-man and the mark, his lance he fixt.</p>
<p>Once more bold Jason threw, but fail&#8217;d to wound <br />
The boar, and slew an undeserving hound, <br />
And thro&#8217; the dog the dart was nail&#8217;d to ground.</p>
<p>Two spears from Meleager&#8217;s hand were sent, <br />
With equal force, but various in th&#8217; event: <br />
The first was fix&#8217;d in earth, the second stood <br />
On the boar&#8217;s bristled back, and deeply drank his blood. <br />
Now while the tortur&#8217;d savage turns around, <br />
And flings about his foam, impatient of the wound, <br />
The wound&#8217;s great author close at hand provokes <br />
His rage, and plies him with redoubled strokes; <br />
Wheels, as he wheels; and with his pointed dart <br />
Explores the nearest passage to his heart. <br />
Quick, and more quick he spins in giddy gires, <br />
Then falls, and in much foam his soul expires. <br />
This act with shouts heav&#8217;n-high the friendly band <br />
Applaud, and strain in theirs the victor&#8217;s hand. <br />
Then all approach the slain with vast surprize, <br />
Admire on what a breadth of earth he lies, <br />
And scarce secure, reach out their spears afar, <br />
And blood their points, to prove their partnership of war.</p>
<p>But he, the conqu&#8217;ring chief, his foot impress&#8217;d <br />
On the strong neck of that destructive beast; <br />
And gazing on the nymph with ardent eyes, <br />
Accept, said he, fair Nonacrine, my prize, <br />
And, though inferior, suffer me to join <br />
My labours, and my part of praise, with thine: <br />
At this presents her with the tusky head <br />
And chine, with rising bristles roughly spread. <br />
Glad she receiv&#8217;d the gift; and seem&#8217;d to take <br />
With double pleasure, for the giver&#8217;s sake. <br />
The rest were seiz&#8217;d with sullen discontent, <br />
And a deaf murmur through the squadron went: <br />
All envy&#8217;d; but the Thestyan brethren show&#8217;d <br />
The least respect, and thus they vent their spleen aloud: <br />
Lay down those honour&#8217;d spoils, nor think to share, <br />
Weak woman as thou art, the prize of war: <br />
Ours is the title, thine a foreign claim, <br />
Since Meleagrus from our lineage came. <br />
Trust not thy beauty; but restore the prize, <br />
Which he, besotted on that face, and eyes, <br />
Would rend from us: at this, enflam&#8217;d with spite, <br />
From her they snatch the gift, from him the giver&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>But soon th&#8217; impatient prince his fauchion drew, <br />
And cry&#8217;d, Ye robbers of another&#8217;s due, <br />
Now learn the diff&#8217;rence, at your proper cost, <br />
Betwixt true valour, and an empty boast. <br />
At this advanc&#8217;d, and sudden as the word, <br />
In proud Plexippus&#8217; bosom plung&#8217;d the sword: <br />
Toxeus amaz&#8217;d, and with amazement slow, <br />
Or to revenge, or ward the coming blow, <br />
Stood doubting; and while doubting thus he stood, <br />
Receiv&#8217;d the steel bath&#8217;d in his brother&#8217;s blood.</p>
<p>Pleas&#8217;d with the first, unknown the second news; <br />
Althaea to the temples pays their dues <br />
For her son&#8217;s conquest; when at length appear <br />
Her grisly brethren stretch&#8217;d upon the bier: <br />
Pale at the sudden sight, she chang&#8217;d her cheer, <br />
And with her cheer her robes; but hearing tell <br />
The cause, the manner, and by whom they fell, <br />
&#8216;Twas grief no more, or grief and rage were one <br />
Within her soul; at last &#8217;twas rage alone; <br />
Which burning upwards in succession, dries <br />
The tears, that stood consid&#8217;ring in her eyes.</p>
<p>There lay a log unlighted on the hearth, <br />
When she was lab&#8217;ring in the throws of birth <br />
For th&#8217; unborn chief; the fatal sisters came, <br />
And rais&#8217;d it up, and toss&#8217;d it on the flame: <br />
Then on the rock a scanty measure place <br />
Of vital flax, and turn&#8217;d the wheel apace; <br />
And turning sung, To this red brand and thee, <br />
O new born babe, we give an equal destiny; <br />
So vanish&#8217;d out of view. The frighted dame <br />
Sprung hasty from her bed, and quench&#8217;d the flame: <br />
The log, in secret lock&#8217;d, she kept with care, <br />
And that, while thus preserv&#8217;d, preserv&#8217;d her heir. <br />
This brand she now produc&#8217;d; and first she strows <br />
The hearth with heaps of chips, and after blows; <br />
Thrice heav&#8217;d her hand, and heav&#8217;d, she thrice repress&#8217;d: <br />
The sister and the mother long contest, <br />
Two doubtful titles, in one tender breast: <br />
And now her eyes, and cheeks with fury glow, <br />
Now pale her cheeks, her eyes with pity flow: <br />
Now low&#8217;ring looks presage approaching storms, <br />
And now prevailing love her face reforms: <br />
Resolv&#8217;d, she doubts again; the tears she dry&#8217;d <br />
With burning rage, are by new tears supply&#8217;d; <br />
And as a ship, which winds and waves assail <br />
Now with the current drives, now with the gale, <br />
Both opposite, and neither long prevail: <br />
She feels a double force, by turns obeys <br />
Th&#8217; imperious tempest, and th&#8217; impetuous seas: <br />
So fares Althaea&#8217;s mind, she first relents <br />
With pity, of that pity then repents: <br />
Sister, and mother long the scales divide, <br />
But the beam nodded on the sister&#8217;s side. <br />
Sometimes she softly sigh&#8217;d, then roar&#8217;d aloud; <br />
But sighs were stifled in the cries of blood.</p>
<p>The pious, impious wretch at length decreed, <br />
To please her brothers&#8217; ghost, her son should bleed: <br />
And when the fun&#8217;ral flames began to rise, <br />
Receive, she said, a sister&#8217;s sacrifice; <br />
A mother&#8217;s bowels burn: high in her hand, <br />
Thus while she spoke, she held the fatal brand; <br />
Then thrice before the kindled pile she bow&#8217;d, <br />
And the three Furies thrice invok&#8217;d aloud: <br />
Come, come, revenging sisters, come, and view <br />
A sister paying her dead brothers due: <br />
A crime I punish, and a crime commit; <br />
But blood for blood, and death for death is fit: <br />
Great crimes must be with greater crimes repaid, <br />
And second fun&#8217;rals on the former laid. <br />
Let the whole houshold in one ruin fall, <br />
And may Diana&#8217;s curse o&#8217;ertake us all. <br />
Shall Fate to happy Oenus still allow <br />
One son, while Thestius stands depriv&#8217;d of two? <br />
Better three lost, than one unpunish&#8217;d go. <br />
Take then, dear ghosts (while yet admitted new <br />
In Hell you wait my duty), take your due: <br />
A costly off&#8217;ring on your tomb is laid, <br />
When with my blood the price of yours is paid.</p>
<p>Ah! whither am I hurry&#8217;d? Ah! forgive, <br />
Ye shades, and let your sister&#8217;s issue live; <br />
A mother cannot give him death; tho&#8217; he <br />
Deserves it, he deserves it not from me.</p>
<p>Then shall th&#8217; unpunish&#8217;d wretch insult the slain, <br />
Triumphant live, nor only live, but reign? <br />
While you, thin shades, the sport of winds, are tost <br />
O&#8217;er dreary plains, or tread the burning coast. <br />
I cannot, cannot bear; &#8217;tis past, &#8217;tis done; <br />
Perish this impious, this detested son: <br />
Perish his sire, and perish I withal; <br />
And let the house&#8217;s heir, and the hop&#8217;d kingdom fall.</p>
<p>Where is the mother fled, her pious love, <br />
And where the pains with which ten months I strove! <br />
Ah! had&#8217;st thou dy&#8217;d, my son, in infant years, <br />
Thy little herse had been bedew&#8217;d with tears.</p>
<p>Thou liv&#8217;st by me; to me thy breath resign; <br />
Mine is the merit, the demerit thine. <br />
Thy life by double title I require; <br />
Once giv&#8217;n at birth, and once preserv&#8217;d from fire: <br />
One murder pay, or add one murder more, <br />
And me to them who fell by thee restore.</p>
<p>I would, but cannot: my son&#8217;s image stands <br />
Before my sight; and now their angry hands <br />
My brothers hold, and vengeance these exact; <br />
This pleads compassion, and repents the fact.</p>
<p>He pleads in vain, and I pronounce his doom: <br />
My brothers, though unjustly, shall o&#8217;ercome. <br />
But having paid their injur&#8217;d ghosts their due, <br />
My son requires my death, and mine shall his pursue.</p>
<p>At this, for the last time, she lifts her hand, <br />
Averts her eyes, and, half unwilling, drops the brand. <br />
The brand, amid the flaming fewel thrown, <br />
Or drew, or seem&#8217;d to draw, a dying groan; <br />
The fires themselves but faintly lick&#8217;d their prey, <br />
Then loath&#8217;d their impious food, and would have shrunk away.</p>
<p>Just then the heroe cast a doleful cry, <br />
And in those absent flames began to fry: <br />
The blind contagion rag&#8217;d within his veins; <br />
But he with manly patience bore his pains: <br />
He fear&#8217;d not Fate, but only griev&#8217;d to die <br />
Without an honest wound, and by a death so dry. <br />
Happy Ancaeus, thrice aloud he cry&#8217;d, <br />
With what becoming fate in arms he dy&#8217;d! <br />
Then call&#8217;d his brothers, sisters, sire around, <br />
And, her to whom his nuptial vows were bound, <br />
Perhaps his mother; a long sigh she drew, <br />
And his voice failing, took his last adieu. <br />
For as the flames augment, and as they stay <br />
At their full height, then languish to decay, <br />
They rise and sink by fits; at last they soar <br />
In one bright blaze, and then descend no more: <br />
Just so his inward heats, at height, impair, <br />
&#8216;Till the last burning breath shoots out the soul in air.</p>
<p>Now lofty Calidon in ruins lies; <br />
All ages, all degrees unsluice their eyes, <br />
And Heav&#8217;n, and Earth resound with murmurs, groans, and cries. <br />
Matrons and maidens beat their breasts, and tear <br />
Their habits, and root up their scatter&#8217;d hair: <br />
The wretched father, father now no more, <br />
With sorrow sunk, lies prostrate on the floor, <br />
Deforms his hoary locks with dust obscene, <br />
And curses age, and loaths a life prolong&#8217;d with pain. <br />
By steel her stubborn soul his mother freed, <br />
And punish&#8217;d on her self her impious deed.</p>
<p>Had I a hundred tongues, a wit so large <br />
As could their hundred offices discharge; <br />
Had Phoebus all his Helicon bestow&#8217;d <br />
In all the streams, inspiring all the God; <br />
Those tongues, that wit, those streams, that God in vain <br />
Would offer to describe his sisters&#8217; pain: <br />
They beat their breasts with many a bruizing blow, <br />
&#8216;Till they turn livid, and corrupt the snow. <br />
The corps they cherish, while the corps remains, <br />
And exercise, and rub with fruitless pains; <br />
And when to fun&#8217;ral flames &#8217;tis born away, <br />
They kiss the bed on which the body lay: <br />
And when those fun&#8217;ral flames no longer burn <br />
(The dust compos&#8217;d within a pious urn), <br />
Ev&#8217;n in that urn their brother they confess, <br />
And hug it in their arms, and to their bosoms press.</p>
<p>His tomb is rais&#8217;d; then, stretch&#8217;d along the ground, <br />
Those living monuments his tomb surround: <br />
Ev&#8217;n to his name, inscrib&#8217;d, their tears they pay, <br />
&#8216;Till tears, and kisses wear his name away.</p>
<p>But Cynthia now had all her fury spent, <br />
Not with less ruin than a race content: <br />
Excepting Gorge, perish&#8217;d all the seed, <br />
And her whom Heav&#8217;n for Hercules decreed. <br />
Satiate at last, no longer she pursu&#8217;d <br />
The weeping sisters; but With Wings endu&#8217;d, <br />
And horny beaks, and sent to flit in air; <br />
Who yearly round the tomb in feather&#8217;d flocks repair.</p>
<p>The Transformation of the Naiads</p>
<p>Theseus mean-while acquitting well his share <br />
In the bold chace confed&#8217;rate like a war, <br />
To Athens&#8217; lofty tow&#8217;rs his march ordain&#8217;d, <br />
By Pallas lov&#8217;d, and where Erectheus reign&#8217;d. <br />
But Achelous stop&#8217;d him on the way, <br />
By rains a deluge, and constrain&#8217;d his stay.</p>
<p>O fam&#8217;d for glorious deeds, and great by blood, <br />
Rest here, says he, nor trust the rapid flood; <br />
It solid oaks has from its margin tore, <br />
And rocky fragments down its current bore, <br />
The murmur hoarse, and terrible the roar. <br />
Oft have I seen herds with their shelt&#8217;ring fold <br />
Forc&#8217;d from the banks, and in the torrent roul&#8217;d; <br />
Nor strength the bulky steer from ruin freed, <br />
Nor matchless swiftness sav&#8217;d the racing steed. <br />
In cataracts when the dissolving snow <br />
Falls from the hills, and floods the plains below; <br />
Toss&#8217;d by the eddies with a giddy round, <br />
Strong youths are in the sucking whirlpools drown&#8217;d. <br />
&#8216;Tis best with me in safety to abide, <br />
&#8216;Till usual bounds restrain the ebbing tide, <br />
And the low waters in their channel glide.</p>
<p>Theseus perswaded, in compliance bow&#8217;d: <br />
So kind an offer, and advice so good, <br />
O Achelous, cannot be refus&#8217;d; <br />
I&#8217;ll use them both, said he; and both he us&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The grot he enter&#8217;d, pumice built the hall, <br />
And tophi made the rustick of the wall; <br />
The floor, soft moss, an humid carpet spread, <br />
And various shells the chequer&#8217;d roof inlaid. <br />
&#8216;Twas now the hour when the declining sun <br />
Two thirds had of his daily journey run; <br />
At the spread table Theseus took his place, <br />
Next his companions in the daring chace; <br />
Perithous here, there elder Lelex lay, <br />
His locks betraying age with sprinkled grey. <br />
Acharnia&#8217;s river-God dispos&#8217;d the rest, <br />
Grac&#8217;d with the equal honour of the feast, <br />
Elate with joy, and proud of such a guest. <br />
The nymphs were waiters, and with naked feet <br />
In order serv&#8217;d the courses of the meat. <br />
The banquet done, delicious wine they brought, <br />
Of one transparent gem the cup was wrought.</p>
<p>Then the great heroe of this gallant train, <br />
Surveying far the prospect of the main: <br />
What is that land, says he, the waves embrace? <br />
(And with his finger pointed at the place); <br />
Is it one parted isle which stands alone? <br />
How nam&#8217;d? and yet methinks it seems not one. <br />
To whom the watry God made this reply; <br />
&#8216;Tis not one isle, but five; distinct they lye; <br />
&#8216;Tis distance which deceives the cheated eye. <br />
But that Diana&#8217;s act may seem less strange, <br />
These once proud Naiads were, before their change. <br />
&#8216;Twas on a day more solemn than the rest, <br />
Ten bullocks slain, a sacrificial feast: <br />
The rural Gods of all the region near <br />
They bid to dance, and taste the hallow&#8217;d cheer. <br />
Me they forgot: affronted with the slight, <br />
My rage, and stream swell&#8217;d to the greatest height; <br />
And with the torrent of my flooding store, <br />
Large woods from woods, and fields from fields I tore. <br />
The guilty nymphs, oh! then, remembring me, <br />
I, with their country, wash&#8217;d into the sea; <br />
And joining waters with the social main, <br />
Rent the gross land, and split the firm champagne. <br />
Since, the Echinades, remote from shore <br />
Are view&#8217;d as many isles, as nymphs before.</p>
<p>Perimele turn&#8217;d into an Island</p>
<p>But yonder far, lo, yonder does appear <br />
An isle, a part to me for ever dear. <br />
From that (it sailors Perimele name) <br />
I doating, forc&#8217;d by rape a virgin&#8217;s fame. <br />
Hippodamas&#8217;s passion grew so strong, <br />
Gall&#8217;d with th&#8217; abuse, and fretted at the wrong, <br />
He cast his pregnant daughter from a rock; <br />
I spread my waves beneath, and broke the shock; <br />
And as her swimming weight my stream convey&#8217;d, <br />
I su&#8217;d for help divine, and thus I pray&#8217;d: <br />
O pow&#8217;rful thou, whose trident does command <br />
The realm of waters, which surround the land; <br />
We sacred rivers, wheresoe&#8217;er begun, <br />
End in thy lot, and to thy empire run. <br />
With favour hear, and help with present aid; <br />
Her whom I bear &#8217;twas guilty I betray&#8217;d. <br />
Yet if her father had been just, or mild, <br />
He would have been less impious to his child; <br />
In her, have pity&#8217;d force in the abuse; <br />
In me, admitted love for my excuse. <br />
O let relief for her hard case be found, <br />
Her, whom paternal rage expell&#8217;d from ground, <br />
Her, whom paternal rage relentless drown&#8217;d. <br />
Grant her some place, or change her to a place, <br />
Which I may ever clasp with my embrace.</p>
<p>His nodding head the sea&#8217;s great ruler bent, <br />
And all his waters shook with his assent. <br />
The nymph still swam, tho&#8217; with the fright distrest, <br />
I felt her heart leap trembling in her breast; <br />
But hardning soon, whilst I her pulse explore, <br />
A crusting Earth cas&#8217;d her stiff body o&#8217;er; <br />
And as accretions of new-cleaving soil <br />
Inlarg&#8217;d the mass, the nymph became an isle.</p>
<p>The Story of Baucis and Philemon</p>
<p>Thus Achelous ends: his audience hear <br />
With admiration, and admiring, fear <br />
The Pow&#8217;rs of Heav&#8217;n; except Ixion&#8217;s Son, <br />
Who laugh&#8217;d at all the Gods, believ&#8217;d in none: <br />
He shook his impious head, and thus replies. <br />
These legends are no more than pious lies: <br />
You attribute too much to heav&#8217;nly sway, <br />
To think they give us forms, and take away.</p>
<p>The rest of better minds, their sense declar&#8217;d <br />
Against this doctrine, and with horror heard. <br />
Then Lelex rose, an old experienc&#8217;d man, <br />
And thus with sober gravity began; <br />
Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s pow&#8217;r is infinite: Earth, Air, and Sea, <br />
The manufacture mass, the making Pow&#8217;r obey: <br />
By proof to clear your doubt; in Phrygian ground <br />
Two neighb&#8217;ring trees, with walls encompass&#8217;d round, <br />
Stand on a mod&#8217;rate rise, with wonder shown, <br />
One a hard oak, a softer linden one: <br />
I saw the place, and them, by Pittheus sent <br />
To Phrygian realms, my grandsire&#8217;s government. <br />
Not far from thence is seen a lake, the haunt <br />
Of coots, and of the fishing cormorant: <br />
Here Jove with Hermes came; but in disguise <br />
Of mortal men conceal&#8217;d their deities; <br />
One laid aside his thunder, one his rod; <br />
And many toilsome steps together trod: <br />
For harbour at a thousand doors they knock&#8217;d, <br />
Not one of all the thousand but was lock&#8217;d. <br />
At last an hospitable house they found, <br />
A homely shed; the roof, not far from ground, <br />
Was thatch&#8217;d with reeds, and straw, together bound. <br />
There Baucis and Philemon liv&#8217;d, and there <br />
Had liv&#8217;d long marry&#8217;d, and a happy pair: <br />
Now old in love, though little was their store, <br />
Inur&#8217;d to want, their poverty they bore, <br />
Nor aim&#8217;d at wealth, professing to be poor. <br />
For master, or for servant here to call, <br />
Was all alike, where only two were all. <br />
Command was none, where equal love was paid, <br />
Or rather both commanded, both obey&#8217;d.</p>
<p>From lofty roofs the Gods repuls&#8217;d before, <br />
Now stooping, enter&#8217;d through the little door: <br />
The man (their hearty welcome first express&#8217;d) <br />
A common settle drew for either guest, <br />
Inviting each his weary limbs to rest. <br />
But ere they sate, officious Baucis lays <br />
Two cushions stuff&#8217;d with straw, the seat to raise; <br />
Coarse, but the best she had; then rakes the load <br />
Of ashes from the hearth, and spreads abroad <br />
The living coals; and, lest they should expire, <br />
With leaves, and bark she feeds her infant fire: <br />
It smoaks; and then with trembling breath she blows, <br />
&#8216;Till in a chearful blaze the flames arose. <br />
With brush-wood, and with chips she strengthens these, <br />
And adds at last the boughs of rotten trees. <br />
The fire thus form&#8217;d, she sets the kettle on <br />
(Like burnish&#8217;d gold the little seether shone), <br />
Next took the coleworts which her husband got <br />
From his own ground (a small well-water&#8217;d spot); <br />
She stripp&#8217;d the stalks of all their leaves; the best <br />
She cull&#8217;d, and them with handy care she drest. <br />
High o&#8217;er the hearth a chine of bacon hung; <br />
Good old Philemon seiz&#8217;d it with a prong, <br />
And from the sooty rafter drew it down, <br />
Then cut a slice, but scarce enough for one; <br />
Yet a large portion of a little store, <br />
Which for their sakes alone he wish&#8217;d were more. <br />
This in the pot he plung&#8217;d without delay, <br />
To tame the flesh, and drain the salt away. <br />
The time beween, before the fire they sat, <br />
And shorten&#8217;d the delay by pleasing chat.</p>
<p>A beam there was, on which a beechen pail <br />
Hung by the handle, on a driven nail: <br />
This fill&#8217;d with water, gently warm&#8217;d, they set <br />
Before their guests; in this they bath&#8217;d their feet, <br />
And after with clean towels dry&#8217;d their sweat. <br />
This done, the host produc&#8217;d the genial bed, <br />
Sallow the feet, the borders, and the sted, <br />
Which with no costly coverlet they spread, <br />
But coarse old garments; yet such robes as these <br />
They laid alone, at feasts, on holidays. <br />
The good old housewife, tucking up her gown, <br />
The table sets; th&#8217; invited Gods lie down. <br />
The trivet-table of a foot was lame, <br />
A blot which prudent Baucis overcame, <br />
Who thrusts beneath the limping leg a sherd, <br />
So was the mended board exactly rear&#8217;d: <br />
Then rubb&#8217;d it o&#8217;er with newly gather&#8217;d mint, <br />
A wholsom herb, that breath&#8217;d a grateful scent. <br />
Pallas began the feast, where first was seen <br />
The party-colour&#8217;d olive, black, and green: <br />
Autumnal cornels next in order serv&#8217;d, <br />
In lees of wine well pickled, and preserv&#8217;d. <br />
A garden-sallad was the third supply, <br />
Of endive, radishes, and succory: <br />
Then curds, and cream, the flow&#8217;r of country fare, <br />
And new-laid eggs, which Baucis&#8217; busie care <br />
Turn&#8217;d by a gentle fire, and roasted rare. <br />
All these in earthen ware were serv&#8217;d to board; <br />
And next in place, an earthen pitcher stor&#8217;d, <br />
With liquor of the best the cottage could afford. <br />
This was the table&#8217;s ornament and pride, <br />
With figures wrought: like pages at his side <br />
Stood beechen bowls; and these were shining clean, <br />
Varnish&#8217;d with wax without, and lin&#8217;d within. <br />
By this the boiling kettle had prepar&#8217;d, <br />
And to the table sent the smoaking lard; <br />
On which with eager appetite they dine, <br />
A sav&#8217;ry bit, that serv&#8217;d to relish wine: <br />
The wine itself was suiting to the rest, <br />
Still working in the must, and lately press&#8217;d. <br />
The second course succeeds like that before, <br />
Plums, apples, nuts, and of their wintry store <br />
Dry figs, and grapes, and wrinkled dates were set <br />
In canisters, t&#8217; enlarge the little treat: <br />
All these a milk-white honey-comb surround, <br />
Which in the midst the country-banquet crown&#8217;d: <br />
But the kind hosts their entertainment grace <br />
With hearty welcome, and an open face: <br />
In all they did, you might discern with ease, <br />
A willing mind, and a desire to please.</p>
<p>Mean-time the beechen bowls went round, and still, <br />
Though often empty&#8217;d, were observ&#8217;d to fill; <br />
Fill&#8217;d without hands, and of their own accord <br />
Ran without feet, and danc&#8217;d about the board. <br />
Devotion seiz&#8217;d the pair, to see the feast <br />
With wine, and of no common grape, increas&#8217;d; <br />
And up they held their hands, and fell to pray&#8217;r, <br />
Excusing, as they could, their country fare.</p>
<p>One goose they had (&#8217;twas all they could allow), <br />
A wakeful centry, and on duty now, <br />
Whom to the Gods for sacrifice they vow: <br />
Her with malicious zeal the couple view&#8217;d; <br />
She ran for life, and limping they pursu&#8217;d: <br />
Full well the fowl perceiv&#8217;d their bad intent, <br />
And would not make her master&#8217;s compliment; <br />
But persecuted, to the Pow&#8217;rs she flies, <br />
And close between the legs of Jove she lies: <br />
He with a gracious ear the suppliant heard, <br />
And sav&#8217;d her life; then what he has declar&#8217;d, <br />
And own&#8217;d the God. The neighbourhood, said he, <br />
Shall justly perish for impiety: <br />
You stand alone exempted; but obey <br />
With speed, and follow where we lead the way: <br />
Leave these accurs&#8217;d; and to the mountain&#8217;s height <br />
Ascend; nor once look backward in your flight.</p>
<p>They haste, and what their tardy feet deny&#8217;d, <br />
The trusty staff (their better leg) supply&#8217;d. <br />
An arrow&#8217;s flight they wanted to the top, <br />
And there secure, but spent with travel, stop; <br />
Then turn their now no more forbidden eyes; <br />
Lost in a lake the floated level lies: <br />
A watry desart covers all the plains, <br />
Their cot alone, as in an isle, remains. <br />
Wondring, with weeping eyes, while they deplore <br />
Their neighbours&#8217; fate, and country now no more, <br />
Their little shed, scarce large enough for two, <br />
Seems, from the ground increas&#8217;d, in height and bulk to grow. <br />
A stately temple shoots within the skies, <br />
The crotches of their cot in columns rise: <br />
The pavement polish&#8217;d marble they behold, <br />
The gates with sculpture grac&#8217;d, the spires and tiles of gold.</p>
<p>Then thus the sire of Gods, with looks serene, <br />
Speak thy desire, thou only just of men; <br />
And thou, o woman, only worthy found <br />
To be with such a man in marriage bound.</p>
<p>A-while they whisper; then, to Jove address&#8217;d, <br />
Philemon thus prefers their joint request: <br />
We crave to serve before your sacred shrine, <br />
And offer at your altars rites divine: <br />
And since not any action of our life <br />
Has been polluted with domestick strife; <br />
We beg one hour of death, that neither she <br />
With widow&#8217;s tears may live to bury me, <br />
Nor weeping I, with wither&#8217;d arms may bear <br />
My breathless Baucis to the sepulcher.</p>
<p>The Godheads sign their suit. They run their race <br />
In the same tenour all th&#8217; appointed space: <br />
Then, when their hour was come, while they relate <br />
These past adventures at the temple gate, <br />
Old Baucis is by old Philemon seen <br />
Sprouting with sudden leaves of spritely green: <br />
Old Baucis look&#8217;d where old Philemon stood, <br />
And saw his lengthen&#8217;d arms a sprouting wood: <br />
New roots their fasten&#8217;d feet begin to bind, <br />
Their bodies stiffen in a rising rind: <br />
Then, ere the bark above their shoulders grew, <br />
They give, and take at once their last adieu. <br />
At once, Farewell, o faithful spouse, they said; <br />
At once th&#8217; incroaching rinds their closing lips invade. <br />
Ev&#8217;n yet, an ancient Tyanaean shows <br />
A spreading oak, that near a linden grows; <br />
The neighbourhood confirm the prodigy, <br />
Grave men, not vain of tongue, or like to lie. <br />
I saw my self the garlands on their boughs, <br />
And tablets hung for gifts of granted vows; <br />
And off&#8217;ring fresher up, with pious pray&#8217;r, <br />
The good, said I, are God&#8217;s peculiar care, <br />
And such as honour Heav&#8217;n, shall heav&#8217;nly honour share.</p>
<p>The Changes of Proteus</p>
<p>He ceas&#8217;d in his relation to proceed, <br />
Whilst all admir&#8217;d the author, and the deed; <br />
But Theseus most, inquisitive to know <br />
From Gods what wondrous alterations grow. <br />
Whom thus the Calydonian stream address&#8217;d, <br />
Rais&#8217;d high to speak, the couch his elbow press&#8217;d. <br />
Some, when transform&#8217;d, fix in the lasting change; <br />
Some with more right, thro&#8217; various figures range. <br />
Proteus, thus large thy privilege was found, <br />
Thou inmate of the seas, which Earth surround. <br />
Sometimes a bloming youth you grac&#8217;d the shore; <br />
Oft a fierce lion, or a furious boar: <br />
With glist&#8217;ning spires now seem&#8217;d an hissing snake, <br />
The bold would tremble in his hands to take: <br />
With horns assum&#8217;d a bull; sometimes you prov&#8217;d <br />
A tree by roots, a stone by weight unmov&#8217;d: <br />
Sometimes two wav&#8217;ring contraries became, <br />
Flow&#8217;d down in water, or aspir&#8217;d in flame.</p>
<p>The Story of Erisichthon</p>
<p>In various shapes thus to deceive the eyes, <br />
Without a settled stint of her disguise, <br />
Rash Erisichthon&#8217;s daughter had the pow&#8217;r, <br />
And brought it to Autolicus in dow&#8217;r. <br />
Her atheist sire the slighted Gods defy&#8217;d, <br />
And ritual honours to their shrines deny&#8217;d. <br />
As fame reports, his hand an ax sustain&#8217;d, <br />
Which Ceres&#8217; consecrated grove prophan&#8217;d; <br />
Which durst the venerable gloom invade, <br />
And violate with light the awful shade. <br />
An ancient oak in the dark center stood, <br />
The covert&#8217;s glory, and itself a wood: <br />
Garlands embrac&#8217;d its shaft, and from the boughs <br />
Hung tablets, monuments of prosp&#8217;rous vows. <br />
In the cool dusk its unpierc&#8217;d verdure spread, <br />
The Dryads oft their hallow&#8217;d dances led; <br />
And oft, when round their gaging arms they cast, <br />
Full fifteen ells it measu&#8217;rd in the waste: <br />
Its height all under standards did surpass, <br />
As they aspir&#8217;d above the humbler grass.</p>
<p>These motives, which would gentler minds restrain, <br />
Could not make Triope&#8217;s bold son abstain; <br />
He sternly charg&#8217;d his slaves with strict decree, <br />
To fell with gashing steel the sacred tree. <br />
But whilst they, lingring, his commands delay&#8217;d, <br />
He snatch&#8217;d an Ax, and thus blaspheming said: <br />
Was this no oak, nor Ceres&#8217; favourite care, <br />
But Ceres&#8217; self, this arm, unaw&#8217;d, shou&#8217;d dare <br />
Its leafy honours in the dust to spread, <br />
And level with the earth its airy head. <br />
He spoke, and as he poiz&#8217;d a slanting stroak, <br />
Sighs heav&#8217;d, and tremblings shook the frighted oak; <br />
Its leaves look&#8217;d sickly, pale its acorns grew, <br />
And its long branches sweat a chilly dew. <br />
But when his impious hand a wound bestow&#8217;d, <br />
Blood from the mangled bark in currents flow&#8217;d. <br />
When a devoted bull of mighty size, <br />
A sinning nation&#8217;s grand atonement, dies; <br />
With such a plenty from the spouting veins, <br />
A crimson stream the turfy altars stains.</p>
<p>The wonder all amaz&#8217;d; yet one more bold, <br />
The fact dissuading, strove his ax to hold. <br />
But the Thessalian, obstinately bent, <br />
Too proud to change, too harden&#8217;d to repent, <br />
On his kind monitor, his eyes, which burn&#8217;d <br />
With rage, and with his eyes his weapon turn&#8217;d; <br />
Take the reward, says he, of pious dread: <br />
Then with a blow lopp&#8217;d off his parted head. <br />
No longer check&#8217;d, the wretch his crime pursu&#8217;d, <br />
Doubled his strokes, and sacrilege renew&#8217;d; <br />
When from the groaning trunk a voice was heard, <br />
A Dryad I, by Ceres&#8217; love preferr&#8217;d, <br />
Within the circle of this clasping rind <br />
Coeval grew, and now in ruin join&#8217;d; <br />
But instant vengeance shall thy sin pursue, <br />
And death is chear&#8217;d with this prophetick view.</p>
<p>At last the oak with cords enforc&#8217;d to bow, <br />
Strain&#8217;d from the top, and sap&#8217;d with wounds below, <br />
The humbler wood, partaker of its fate, <br />
Crush&#8217;d with its fall, and shiver&#8217;d with its weight.</p>
<p>The grove destroy&#8217;d, the sister Dryads moan, <br />
Griev&#8217;d at its loss, and frighted at their own. <br />
Strait, suppliants for revenge to Ceres go, <br />
In sable weeds, expressive of their woe.</p>
<p>The beauteous Goddess with a graceful air <br />
Bow&#8217;d in consent, and nodded to their pray&#8217;r. <br />
The awful motion shook the fruitful ground, <br />
And wav&#8217;d the fields with golden harvests crown&#8217;d. <br />
Soon she contriv&#8217;d in her projecting mind <br />
A plague severe, and piteous in its kind <br />
(If plagues for crimes of such presumptuous height <br />
Could pity in the softest breast create). <br />
With pinching want, and hunger&#8217;s keenest smart, <br />
To tear his vitals, and corrode his heart. <br />
But since her near approach by Fate&#8217;s deny&#8217;d <br />
To famine, and broad climes their pow&#8217;rs divide, <br />
A nymph, the mountain&#8217;s ranger, she address&#8217;d, <br />
And thus resolv&#8217;d, her high commands express&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The Description of Famine</p>
<p>Where frozen Scythia&#8217;s utmost bound is plac&#8217;d, <br />
A desart lies, a melancholy waste: <br />
In yellow crops there Nature never smil&#8217;d, <br />
No fruitful tree to shade the barren wild. <br />
There sluggish cold its icy station makes, <br />
There paleness, frights, and aguish trembling shakes, <br />
Of pining famine this the fated seat, <br />
To whom my orders in these words repeat: <br />
Bid her this miscreant with her sharpest pains <br />
Chastise, and sheath herself into his veins; <br />
Be unsubdu&#8217;d by plenty&#8217;s baffled store, <br />
Reject my empire, and defeat my pow&#8217;r. <br />
And lest the distance, and the tedious way, <br />
Should with the toil, and long fatigue dismay, <br />
Ascend my chariot, and convey&#8217;d on high, <br />
Guide the rein&#8217;d dragons thro&#8217; the parting sky.</p>
<p>The nymph, accepting of the granted carr, <br />
Sprung to the seat, and posted thro&#8217; the air; <br />
Nor stop&#8217;d &#8217;till she to a bleak mountain came <br />
Of wondrous height, and Caucasus its name. <br />
There in a stony field the fiend she found, <br />
Herbs gnawing, and roots scratching from the ground. <br />
Her elfelock hair in matted tresses grew, <br />
Sunk were her eyes, and pale her ghastly hue, <br />
Wan were her lips, and foul with clammy glew. <br />
Her throat was furr&#8217;d, her guts appear&#8217;d within <br />
With snaky crawlings thro&#8217; her parchment skin. <br />
Her jutting hips seem&#8217;d starting from their place, <br />
And for a belly was a belly&#8217;s space, <br />
Her dugs hung dangling from her craggy spine, <br />
Loose to her breast, and fasten&#8217;d to her chine. <br />
Her joints protuberant by leanness grown, <br />
Consumption sunk the flesh, and rais&#8217;d the bone. <br />
Her knees large orbits bunch&#8217;d to monstrous size, <br />
And ancles to undue proportion rise.</p>
<p>This plague the nymph, not daring to draw near, <br />
At distance hail&#8217;d, and greeted from afar. <br />
And tho&#8217; she told her charge without delay, <br />
Tho&#8217; her arrival late, and short her stay, <br />
She felt keen famine, or she seem&#8217;d to feel, <br />
Invade her blood, and on her vitals steal. <br />
She turn&#8217;d, from the infection to remove, <br />
And back to Thessaly the serpents drove.</p>
<p>The fiend obey&#8217;d the Goddess&#8217; command <br />
(Tho&#8217; their effects in opposition stand), <br />
She cut her way, supported by the wind, <br />
And reach&#8217;d the mansion by the nymph assign&#8217;d.</p>
<p>&#8216;Twas night, when entring Erisichthon&#8217;s room, <br />
Dissolv&#8217;d in sleep, and thoughtless of his doom, <br />
She clasp&#8217;d his limbs, by impious labour tir&#8217;d, <br />
With battish wings, but her whole self inspir&#8217;d; <br />
Breath&#8217;d on his throat and chest a tainting blast, <br />
And in his veins infus&#8217;d an endless fast.</p>
<p>The task dispatch&#8217;d, away the Fury flies <br />
From plenteous regions, and from rip&#8217;ning skies; <br />
To her old barren north she wings her speed, <br />
And cottages distress&#8217;d with pinching need.</p>
<p>Still slumbers Erisichthon&#8217;s senses drown, <br />
And sooth his fancy with their softest down. <br />
He dreams of viands delicate to eat, <br />
And revels on imaginary meat, <br />
Chaws with his working mouth, but chaws in vain, <br />
And tires his grinding teeth with fruitless pain; <br />
Deludes his throat with visionary fare, <br />
Feasts on the wind, and banquets on the air.</p>
<p>The morning came, the night, and slumbers past, <br />
But still the furious pangs of hunger last; <br />
The cank&#8217;rous rage still gnaws with griping pains, <br />
Stings in his throat, and in his bowels reigns.</p>
<p>Strait he requires, impatient in demand, <br />
Provisions from the air, the seas, the land. <br />
But tho&#8217; the land, air, seas, provisions grant, <br />
Starves at full tables, and complains of want. <br />
What to a people might in dole be paid, <br />
Or victual cities for a long blockade, <br />
Could not one wolfish appetite asswage; <br />
For glutting nourishment increas&#8217;d its rage. <br />
As rivers pour&#8217;d from ev&#8217;ry distant shore, <br />
The sea insatiate drinks, and thirsts for more; <br />
Or as the fire, which all materials burns, <br />
And wasted forests into ashes turns, <br />
Grows more voracious, as the more it preys, <br />
Recruits dilate the flame, and spread the blaze: <br />
So impious Erisichthon&#8217;s hunger raves, <br />
Receives refreshments, and refreshments craves. <br />
Food raises a desire for food, and meat <br />
Is but a new provocative to eat. <br />
He grows more empty, as the more supply&#8217;d, <br />
And endless cramming but extends the void.</p>
<p>The Transformations of Erisichthon&#8217;s Daughter</p>
<p>Now riches hoarded by paternal care <br />
Were sunk, the glutton swallowing up the heir. <br />
Yet the devouring flame no stores abate, <br />
Nor less his hunger grew with his estate. <br />
One daughter left, as left his keen desire, <br />
A daughter worthy of a better sire: <br />
Her too he sold, spent Nature to sustain; <br />
She scorn&#8217;d a lord with generous disdain, <br />
And flying, spread her hand upon the main. <br />
Then pray&#8217;d: Grant, thou, I bondage may escape, <br />
And with my liberty reward thy rape; <br />
Repay my virgin treasure with thy aid <br />
(&#8216;Twas Neptune who deflower&#8217;d the beauteous maid).</p>
<p>The God was mov&#8217;d, at what the fair had su&#8217;d, <br />
When she so lately by her master view&#8217;d <br />
In her known figure, on a sudden took <br />
A fisher&#8217;s habit, and a manly look. <br />
To whom her owner hasted to enquire; <br />
O thou, said he, whose baits hide treach&#8217;rous wire; <br />
Whose art can manage, and experienc&#8217;d skill <br />
The taper angle, and the bobbing quill, <br />
So may the sea be ruffled with no storm, <br />
But smooth with calms, as you the truth inform; <br />
So your deceit may no shy fishes feel, <br />
&#8216;Till struck, and fasten&#8217;d on the bearded steel. <br />
Did not you standing view upon the strand, <br />
A wand&#8217;ring maid? I&#8217;m sure I saw her stand; <br />
Her hair disorder&#8217;d, and her homely dress <br />
Betray&#8217;d her want, and witness&#8217;d her distress.</p>
<p>Me heedless, she reply&#8217;d, whoe&#8217;er you are, <br />
Excuse, attentive to another care. <br />
I settled on the deep my steady eye; <br />
Fix&#8217;d on my float, and bent on my employ. <br />
And that you may not doubt what I impart, <br />
So may the ocean&#8217;s God assist my art, <br />
If on the beach since I my sport pursu&#8217;d, <br />
Or man, or woman but my self I view&#8217;d. <br />
Back o&#8217;er the sands, deluded, he withdrew, <br />
Whilst she for her old form put off her new.</p>
<p>Her sire her shifting pow&#8217;r to change perceiv&#8217;d; <br />
And various chapmen by her sale deceiv&#8217;d. <br />
A fowl with spangled plumes, a brinded steer, <br />
Sometimes a crested mare, or antler&#8217;d deer: <br />
Sold for a price, she parted, to maintain <br />
Her starving parent with dishonest gain.</p>
<p>At last all means, as all provisions, fail&#8217;d; <br />
For the disease by remedies prevail&#8217;d; <br />
His muscles with a furious bite he tore, <br />
Gorg&#8217;d his own tatter&#8217;d flesh, and gulph&#8217;d his gore. <br />
Wounds were his feast, his life to life a prey, <br />
Supporting Nature by its own decay.</p>
<p>But foreign stories why shou&#8217;d I relate? <br />
I too my self can to new forms translate, <br />
Tho&#8217; the variety&#8217;s not unconfin&#8217;d, <br />
But fix&#8217;d, in number, and restrain&#8217;d in kind: <br />
For often I this present shape retain, <br />
Oft curl a snake the volumes of my train. <br />
Sometimes my strength into my horns transfer&#8217;d, <br />
A bull I march, the captain of the herd. <br />
But whilst I once those goring weapons wore, <br />
Vast wresting force one from my forehead tore. <br />
Lo, my maim&#8217;d brows the injury still own; <br />
He ceas&#8217;d; his words concluding with a groan. </p>
