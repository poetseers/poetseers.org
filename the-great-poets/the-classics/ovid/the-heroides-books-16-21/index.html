				<p>XVI: Paris to Helen</p>
<p>Daughter of Leda, I, the son of Priam, send you health,</p>
<p>which I allow that only you can grant me.</p>
<p>Shall I speak out, or is there no need to signal known passion,</p>
<p>and is my desire now visible, perhaps more than I wish?</p>
<p>In fact I&#8217;d prefer it hidden, until the time is granted</p>
<p>when fear might not be mixed with joy.</p>
<p>But I dissimulate badly: who in truth could have hidden a fire</p>
<p>that always betrays itself by its own light?</p>
<p>Still if you expect it, I&#8217;ll add my voice also to the fact:</p>
<p>I burn &#8211; now you own the word that declares my heart.</p>
<p>Spare me for confessing it, I beg you, and don&#8217;t read the rest of this</p>
<p>with a harsh expression, but rather one suited to your beauty.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve long been grateful: since the fact that you accepted my letter</p>
<p>gave me hope that, by that token, you might also accept me.</p>
<p>Let it be so: I hope Venus, Love&#8217;s mother, hasn&#8217;t promised you</p>
<p>to me in vain, she who&#8217;s urged me to take this course.</p>
<p>And now I sail, by her divine command &#8211; you shouldn&#8217;t sin</p>
<p>not knowing this &#8211; and her great power is with me from the start.</p>
<p>I ask a great reward it&#8217;s true, and not one that is due me:</p>
<p>Cytherea&#8217;s promised you for my bed.</p>
<p>Guided by this, I&#8217;ve made my uncertain way over the wide sea,</p>
<p>from Sigeum&#8217;s shore, in the ship Phereclus built.</p>
<p>She brought me a helpful breeze, and a following wind -</p>
<p>born from the sea, she no doubt has power at sea.</p>
<p>May she continue, the passion in my heart exhorts me,</p>
<p>so that I might reach your harbour, and my wish.</p>
<p>I brought these desires with me: I didn&#8217;t find them here.</p>
<p>They were the reason for so long a journey.</p>
<p>For neither a wretched storm, nor some error brought me here:</p>
<p>Sparta&#8217;s land was what my fleet sought out.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think I divided the waves with my ship carrying goods -</p>
<p>the wealth I have the gods can keep.</p>
<p>Nor have I come just to visit the towns of Greece:</p>
<p>my kingdom&#8217;s cities are far richer.</p>
<p>I seek you, whom lovely Venus drives towards my bed:</p>
<p>I wished for you before you were known to me.</p>
<p>Your face was in my mind before I saw you with my eyes:</p>
<p>news of your fame first brought me the wound.</p>
<p>Still it&#8217;s no wonder I love, just as if I&#8217;d been struck a blow</p>
<p>by the arrows from a bow, fired from a distance.</p>
<p>So the Fates are pleased: lest you try to shy away from them,</p>
<p>accept the words I tell you, in true honour.</p>
<p>My birth delayed, I was yet held in my mother&#8217;s womb:</p>
<p>by now her belly was swollen with my full weight.</p>
<p>In the form of a dream, she saw herself delivered</p>
<p>of a flaming torch from her pregnant belly.</p>
<p>She woke terrified, and told the fearful vision of deep night</p>
<p>to old Priam, and he in turn to his seers.</p>
<p>One prophesied that Troy would be burnt by Paris&#8217;s fire -</p>
<p>the torch in my heart, such as there is now.</p>
<p>The beauty and vigour of my spirit, though I might have seemed</p>
<p>to have been low-born, were signs of my secret nobility.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a place in the midst of the valleys of wooded Ida,</p>
<p>solitary, crowded with pines and holm-oaks,</p>
<p>where placid sheep, and she-goats that love the rocks,</p>
<p>and slow oxen, with open mouths, won&#8217;t graze:</p>
<p>There I was, leaning against a tree, gazing down</p>
<p>on the walls, and high roofs of Troy, and the sea -</p>
<p>behold, the earth seemed to me to shake, at the tread of many feet -</p>
<p>I speak the truth, scarcely having had faith it was true -</p>
<p>Mercury, the grandchild of mighty Atlas and Pleione,</p>
<p>appeared before my eyes, driven on his swift wings -</p>
<p>it was lawful to see it, let it be lawful to say what I saw -</p>
<p>and there was a rod of gold in the god&#8217;s fingers.</p>
<p>And at that same moment three goddesses, Venus, Athene,</p>
<p>and Hera, set down their tender feet on the grass.</p>
<p>I was stunned, and icy terror raised my hair on end,</p>
<p>when the winged messenger said to me: &#8216;Have no fear!:</p>
<p>you&#8217;re a judge of beauty: end the goddesses&#8217; quarrel,</p>
<p>one beauty is worthy of conquering the other two.&#8217;</p>
<p>Lest I refuse, he commanded it in Jupiter&#8217;s name,</p>
<p>and took himself off right away, on the sky-path to the stars.</p>
<p>My spirits recovered, a sudden courage came to me,</p>
<p>and I wasn&#8217;t afraid to observe each one with a look.</p>
<p>They were all worthy of winning, and as judge I lamented</p>
<p>that all of their cases couldn&#8217;t succeed.</p>
<p>But even then one of them pleased me more,</p>
<p>she, as you might guess, is the one by whom love&#8217;s stirred.</p>
<p>They so much wanted to win: they were fired up</p>
<p>to tempt my judgement with powerful gifts.</p>
<p>Jupiter&#8217;s consort mentioned kingdoms: his daughter valour:</p>
<p>I might wish to think about power or being brave.</p>
<p>Sweet Venus laughed: &#8216;Don&#8217;t let either of their gifts fool you,</p>
<p>they&#8217;re filled with anxious fear,&#8217; she said:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give you, what you should love, the lovelier daughter</p>
<p>of lovely Leda will indeed enter your embrace.&#8217;</p>
<p>She spoke, and, with her gift and her beauty both approved,</p>
<p>victorious, she retraced her steps to the sky.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I believe, the Fates turned to my prosperity,</p>
<p>I was acknowledged a son of the king, by proven signs.</p>
<p>The joyful house increased, accepting a long lost child,</p>
<p>and also, because of it, Troy had a day of festival.</p>
<p>Just as I desire you, women desire me:</p>
<p>you alone can have what many pray for.</p>
<p>Not just the daughters of kings and lords seek me,</p>
<p>but I am cared for and loved by nymphs.</p>
<p>What beauty greater than Oeneone, in the world, is worthy,</p>
<p>after you, to become a daughter-in-law of Priam?</p>
<p>But, Helen, the whole crowd have become loathsome to me,</p>
<p>since I&#8217;ve had hopes of making you my bride.</p>
<p>Waking, my eyes see you: by night, my mind,</p>
<p>when my eyelids lie conquered by tranquil sleep.</p>
<p>How can your beauty, which I&#8217;ve not had pleasure in seeing,</p>
<p>be present to me? I was alight, though the fire was far from me.</p>
<p>I could no longer deny myself that hope of mine,</p>
<p>rather I sought out my wish, by the dark-blue roads.</p>
<p>Phrygian pine fell to the axes of Troy</p>
<p>and wood fit for the ocean waves:</p>
<p>The tall groves were stripped from high Gargara,</p>
<p>and Ida yielded me timbers without number.</p>
<p>Oak is curved for the foundations of my swift ships,</p>
<p>and their ribs are pinned to the curving keel.</p>
<p>Yards are added to masts, and receive the hanging shrouds,</p>
<p>and the raked sterns receive pictures of the gods:</p>
<p>so that the captain sails, an ornate goddess standing there</p>
<p>as sponsor of his union, accompanied by a little Cupid.</p>
<p>After the last hand had finished work on the fleet,</p>
<p>I was happy to leave ,right away, for Aegean waters.</p>
<p>but father and mother stopped me, asking for my prayers</p>
<p>and delaying my going by their pious intent:</p>
<p>and my sister Cassandra, just as she was, with hair unbound,</p>
<p>cried out, as our ships were ready to sail:</p>
<p>&#8216;Where are you rushing to? You&#8217;ll bring fire back with you!</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t know how great the flames are you seek in those waters!&#8217;</p>
<p>The prophetess was right: I found the fires she spoke of,</p>
<p>and savage love blazes in my tender heart.</p>
<p>I left the harbour and carried by helpful winds</p>
<p>I landed on your shores, bride, scion of Oebalus.</p>
<p>Your husband welcomes me as a guest: this too</p>
<p>didn&#8217;t happen without the counsel and will of the gods.</p>
<p>In fact he showed me whatever in all of Sparta</p>
<p>is worthy and distinguished enough to be shown:</p>
<p>But I desired to see your much-praised beauty,</p>
<p>there was nothing else that could captivate my eyes.</p>
<p>When I saw you, I was stunned, and, astonished,</p>
<p>I felt new love swell in my deepest heart.</p>
<p>As far as I could remember, you had such looks</p>
<p>as when Cytherea came to me for judgement.</p>
<p>Equally, if you&#8217;d been in that competition,</p>
<p>Venus winning the palm would have been in doubt.</p>
<p>Fame in fact has greatly commended you,</p>
<p>and no land is ignorant of your beauty.</p>
<p>No other beauty has a name like yours,</p>
<p>anywhere from Phrygia to the place the sun rises!</p>
<p>Do you trust me in this? &#8211; Your fame is less than the truth</p>
<p>and fame&#8217;s almost unkind to your beauty.</p>
<p>I find more here than She promised me,</p>
<p>and your reality exceeds your fame.</p>
<p>So Theseus, who knew all this, deserved to be on fire,</p>
<p>and you were seen to be a prize worthy of such a hero,</p>
<p>when, according to your people&#8217;s custom, you exercised, naked,</p>
<p>in the gleaming gymnasium, a woman among the naked men.</p>
<p>I praise the fact he took you: I&#8217;m amazed he ever returned you.</p>
<p>a prize so great should have been held forever.</p>
<p>My head would have been severed from my blood-stained neck</p>
<p>before I&#8217;d have seen you taken from my bed.</p>
<p>Do you think my hands could ever wish to let you go?</p>
<p>Do you think that while I lived I&#8217;d let you leave my side?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d had to be given up, still, before I produced you,</p>
<p>Venus would not have been entirely idle,</p>
<p>Either I&#8217;d have taken your virginity, or I&#8217;d have snatched</p>
<p>what I could, leaving you still intact.</p>
<p>Only give yourself: so you&#8217;ll know Paris is faithful:</p>
<p>the flame of my funeral pyre alone can end these flames.</p>
<p>I preferred you to kingdoms, that the great wife,</p>
<p>and sister, of Jupiter once offered me,</p>
<p>and, while I can encircle your neck with my arms,</p>
<p>the power of Pallas&#8217;s gift&#8217;s contemptible to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve no regret, nor does anything I chose seem foolish:</p>
<p>my heart remains firm in its desire for you.</p>
<p>I only pray my hope is not allowed to die, oh you,</p>
<p>so worthy, I seek with so much labour!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a low-born man choosing a noble wife,</p>
<p>it would not, trust me, be shameful to be mine.</p>
<p>If you ask you&#8217;ll find Electra the Pleiad, and Jove in my line,</p>
<p>to say nothing of my later ancestors.</p>
<p>My father rules Asia, there&#8217;s no richer region,</p>
<p>with immense borders that can scarcely be surveyed.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see endless cities, and golden palaces,</p>
<p>and temples you&#8217;d say were fit for the gods.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see Troy, and its strong walls with high turrets,</p>
<p>built by the music of Apollo&#8217;s lyre.</p>
<p>What can I tell you of the crowds, and the host of warriors?</p>
<p>The earth can scarcely sustain so many people.</p>
<p>The Trojan women will come to meet you in a dense throng,</p>
<p>and our halls will not hold all the daughters of Phyrgia.</p>
<p>O how often you&#8217;ll say: &#8216;How poor our Achaia is!&#8217;</p>
<p>One house will display the wealth of a city.</p>
<p>But it wouldn&#8217;t be right for me to condemn your Sparta:</p>
<p>the land where you were born is rich for me.</p>
<p>But Sparta&#8217;s tiny, you&#8217;re worthy of a wealthy culture:</p>
<p>that place is not beneficial to your beauty.</p>
<p>That beauty should enjoy copious adornments, without end,</p>
<p>and it&#8217;s fitting that new delights overflow for you.</p>
<p>When you see the refinement of our race of men,</p>
<p>what will you consider the daughters of Greece possess?</p>
<p>Grant only that you won&#8217;t reject a Phrygian husband too easily,</p>
<p>girl born in Therapnaean country.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Phrygian, Ganymede, one born of our race,</p>
<p>who mixes nectar now for the gods.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Phrygian, Tithonus, who&#8217;s Aurora&#8217;s husband: the goddess</p>
<p>carried him off, she who prescribes the final border of night.</p>
<p>Anchises, is Phrygian too, whom the mother of the winged Cupids</p>
<p>loves to lie with on the ridges of Mount Ida.</p>
<p>Nor do I think Menelaus will be preferred to me, in your mind,</p>
<p>when we&#8217;re compared in age and beauty.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll certainly not give you Atreus as a father-in-law, who banishes</p>
<p>the light, who makes the Sun&#8217;s terrified horses shy from the feast:</p>
<p>nor is Priam&#8217;s father red, with his wife&#8217;s father&#8217;s murder:</p>
<p>a Pelops, who stained the Myrtoan waters with his crime:</p>
<p>Nor is Tantalus my ancestor, snatching fruit in Styx&#8217;s waters,</p>
<p>and seeking moisture in the midst of the stream.</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t it concern me that one born of those has you?</p>
<p>To think that Jove&#8217;s the father-in-law of this house!</p>
<p>Ah, the crime of it! All the night that man who&#8217;s unworthy of you</p>
<p>holds you in his embrace, and enjoys you to the full:</p>
<p>but I, in short, scarcely see you when the tables are set,</p>
<p>and that time too is full of things that wound me.</p>
<p>May my enemies experience such feasts as ours,</p>
<p>that I often suffer when the wine goes round.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;m a guest, when I see that boor</p>
<p>put his arms round your neck, as I watch.</p>
<p>I swell with anger and envy &#8211; why shouldn&#8217;t I tell all -</p>
<p>when he fondles your limbs beneath your clothes.</p>
<p>Truly, when you grant him gentle kisses in my presence,</p>
<p>I place the cup I&#8217;ve lifted in front of my eyes:</p>
<p>I drop my gaze when you take his arm,</p>
<p>and the food sticks in my unwilling throat.</p>
<p>Often I give a groan: and you, impudent girl, I noticed,</p>
<p>you can&#8217;t hold back your laughter at my groans.</p>
<p>Often I&#8217;d have drowned my passion in wine, but it grew,</p>
<p>and drunkenness was a fire added to a fire.</p>
<p>Many times, not to see you, I reclined with my face averted:</p>
<p>but my eyes were immediately called back to you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;ll do: it&#8217;s a grief to see you,</p>
<p>but a worse grief to be absent from your face.</p>
<p>As I can and might, I struggle to hide my passion,</p>
<p>but though I pretend, my love still shows.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not lying to you: you feel my wounds, you feel:</p>
<p>and I hope they are only known to you.</p>
<p>Ah, how often I&#8217;ve turned my face away when tears came,</p>
<p>so he might not see the reason for my tears.</p>
<p>Ah, how often in drink I&#8217;ve told of some love affair,</p>
<p>repeating every word that troubles you,</p>
<p>and expressing my judgment under cover of my tale:</p>
<p>truly I was that lover, if you didn&#8217;t realise.</p>
<p>Indeed, so that I might use lascivious words,</p>
<p>more than once my drunkenness was feigned.</p>
<p>I remember your breasts were exposed, betrayed by your dress,</p>
<p>and gave my eyes an opening to your nakedness,</p>
<p>breasts whiter than pure snow, or milk</p>
<p>or Jove, that swan, who embraced your mother.</p>
<p>While I was stunned, gazing &#8211; as I held a cup tightly -</p>
<p>the handle slipped from my curving fingers.</p>
<p>If you gave your daughter, Hermione, kisses, I delighted</p>
<p>right away in taking them from her tender lips.</p>
<p>And now, reclining there, I sang of ancient loves,</p>
<p>and now, by nods, I gave you secret messages.</p>
<p>And I dared to address your close friends recently,</p>
<p>Clymene and Aethra, in flattering tones:</p>
<p>who said no more to me than that they were frightened,</p>
<p>and left me, in the middle of stating my requests.</p>
<p>The gods should make you the prize in some great contest,</p>
<p>and the victor might have you, for his bed,</p>
<p>as Hippomenes took Atalanta, Schoeney&#8217;s daughter, in the race,</p>
<p>as Hippodamia came to Phrygian Pelops&#8217;s breast,</p>
<p>as Hercules broke Achelous&#8217;s horn,</p>
<p>while he sought your embrace, Deianira.</p>
<p>My courage might have passed boldly through these trials,</p>
<p>and you would have been needful of my efforts.</p>
<p>Now there&#8217;s nothing left for me but to beg, my lovely one,</p>
<p>and clasp your ankles, if you allow it.</p>
<p>O beauty, O present glory of the Twins,</p>
<p>O woman worthy of Jove for a husband, if you were not his scion,</p>
<p>either I&#8217;ll return to Sigeum&#8217;s harbour with you my bride</p>
<p>or, exiled, I&#8217;ll be covered by the earth here, in Taenaria!</p>
<p>My heart&#8217;s not been lightly grazed by the arrow&#8217;s point:</p>
<p>the wound has penetrated to my bones!</p>
<p>Now I recall, that to be pierced by a heavenly arrow</p>
<p>was the truth that my sister prophesied.</p>
<p>Helen, forebear to deny the love we&#8217;re given -</p>
<p>so that the gods will be ready to hear your prayers.</p>
<p>Many things come to mind: but, to say more in person,</p>
<p>take me to your bed in the silence of the night.</p>
<p>Perhaps you&#8217;re ashamed, and fear to desecrate the marriage bond</p>
<p>and betray the chaste rights of your lawful bed?</p>
<p>Ah, I won&#8217;t speak crudely, or too frankly Helen,</p>
<p>but do you think beauty can ever be free from sin?</p>
<p>You must either alter your beauty or be less harsh:</p>
<p>Chastity conflicts with great loveliness.</p>
<p>Jupiter delights in these intrigues, and lovely Venus:</p>
<p>such an intrigue surely gave you Jove for a father.</p>
<p>If the forces of love are in the seed it could hardly be</p>
<p>that the daughter of Jove and Leda could be chaste.</p>
<p>Still you&#8217;d be chaste while you kept to my Troy,</p>
<p>and I ask that I might be your only crime.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;ll offend in what our hour of marriage will set right,</p>
<p>if only Venus made me no idle promises.</p>
<p>But indeed your husband persuades you to this, voicelessly:</p>
<p>he&#8217;s away, that his guest&#8217;s intrigue might not be hindered.</p>
<p>he found no time more fitting, to see his Cretan kingdom -</p>
<p>oh, what a wonderfully cunning man!</p>
<p>&#8216;Wife, run my affairs, and as I&#8217;ve asked you,&#8217; he said on leaving,</p>
<p>&#8216;take care of my guest, in my place.&#8217;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a witness, you&#8217;ll slight your absent husband,</p>
<p>if your every care&#8217;s not for your guest.</p>
<p>Do you hope this thoughtless man, my Tyndaris,</p>
<p>might sufficiently understand your gift of beauty?</p>
<p>You&#8217;re wrong: he&#8217;s ignorant: if he thought that what he held</p>
<p>was some great good, he wouldn&#8217;t trust it to a stranger.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re not stirred by my voice or my ardour,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m compelled to seize the advantage:</p>
<p>if not I&#8217;d be as foolish as indeed he is himself,</p>
<p>in letting such a carefree time be idly lost.</p>
<p>Your lover&#8217;s almost been led to you, by his hand:</p>
<p>use your husband&#8217;s mandate in all innocence!</p>
<p>You lie alone in your empty bed, through such long nights:</p>
<p>on my empty couch indeed I too lie alone.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s join in shared delights, you with me, and I with you:</p>
<p>midnight will be brighter than the day.</p>
<p>Then I&#8217;ll swear to you by whatever gods</p>
<p>and I&#8217;ll be bound by my words according to your rites:</p>
<p>then, unless our pledge is false,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll make ready for you to travel to my kingdom.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re ashamed, and fear lest you&#8217;re seen to go with me,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be the sole culprit in our crime.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll imitate the deed of Theseus, and your twin brothers:</p>
<p>I can touch on no more appropriate example.</p>
<p>Theseus snatched you, the Twins took the daughters of Leucippus:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be numbered there too, as a fourth example.</p>
<p>The Trojan fleet is here, equipped with arms and men:</p>
<p>soon wind and oar could send them on their way.</p>
<p>A mighty queen you&#8217;ll go, through the Dardanian cities,</p>
<p>and people will think you&#8217;re a new goddess there,</p>
<p>as you take your course the flames will burn with cinnamon,</p>
<p>and a victim falling will strike the blood-stained earth.</p>
<p>My father will bring you gifts, and my brothers, mother, sisters,</p>
<p>all the daughters of Ilium, the whole of Troy.</p>
<p>Ah me! I can scarcely speak a tiny part of what will be,</p>
<p>more will be given to you than my letter mentions.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t fear if you&#8217;re snatched away fierce war will pursue us,</p>
<p>and mighty Greece rouse its armed men.</p>
<p>Of all the abducted have any been brought back by armies?</p>
<p>Trust me, that thought&#8217;s full of idle fear.</p>
<p>The Thracians seized Orythia, Erectheus&#8217;s daughter,</p>
<p>in Boreas&#8217;s name, and Bistonia was safe from war.</p>
<p>Jason of Pagasa took Phasian Medea, in the first ship, the Argo,</p>
<p>and the land of Thessaly wasn&#8217;t harmed at Colchian hands.</p>
<p>Theseus who also took you, snatched the Minoan, Ariadne:</p>
<p>yet Minos did not call on the Cretans to take up arms.</p>
<p>The fear&#8217;s often greater than the risk in these things:</p>
<p>who&#8217;s afraid ends up ashamed, for what they might have lost.</p>
<p>Still, imagine, if you wish, a mighty war&#8217;s begun:</p>
<p>I have warriors, and my weapons can do harm.</p>
<p>Asia is no less wealthy than your country:</p>
<p>she has a wealth of men and horses.</p>
<p>Nor does Menelaus, son of Atreus, have more courage</p>
<p>than Paris, nor is he superior in arms.</p>
<p>When only a boy, I recovered our stolen herds, slaying the enemy, and for that reason bear the name, Alexander, &#8216;defender&#8217;.</p>
<p>When only a boy, I conquered youths in varied competition,</p>
<p>among whom were Ilioneus and Deiphobus.</p>
<p>Lest you think I&#8217;m only to be feared in hand-to-hand combat,</p>
<p>I can pierce with my arrow whatever place you choose.</p>
<p>Can you show me deeds like these, in his early youth:</p>
<p>can you train the son of Atreus in my arts?</p>
<p>If you grant all that, can you grant him Hector for a brother?</p>
<p>He alone would be like having innumerable soldiers.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t know my worth, and my strength&#8217;s deceptive:</p>
<p>you, who&#8217;ll be his future bride, don&#8217;t know the man.</p>
<p>So they&#8217;ll either demand you back, without the tumult of war,</p>
<p>or the Greek force will fall to my army.</p>
<p>Yet I&#8217;d not be displeased to take up arms for such a wife:</p>
<p>great prizes arouse competition.</p>
<p>You too, if all the world contends because of you,</p>
<p>you&#8217;ll bear a famous name, to all posterity.</p>
<p>Only trust me: fearlessly departing, with the gods we favour,</p>
<p>claim my service, as we swore, in complete faith.</p>
<p>XVII: Helen to Paris
</p>
<p>Paris, if only I might have not read what I&#8217;ve read,</p>
<p>I might indeed retain your good regard as before.</p>
<p>Now that my eyes have been troubled by your letter,</p>
<p>I take pride in not replying lightly.</p>
<p>A chance stranger to our sacred hospitality you&#8217;ve dared</p>
<p>to tamper with the rightful loyalty of a wife!</p>
<p>When Taenarus&#8217;s shore welcomed you, driven by stormy seas,</p>
<p>to its harbour, and, our kingdom held no doors shut against you, though you come of a foreign people,</p>
<p>is insult then to be the reward for such great services?</p>
<p>You who so enter, are you friend or enemy?</p>
<p>No doubt, in your judgement, my reproach,</p>
<p>though just, might indeed be called naive.</p>
<p>Let me be naive, then, as long as I&#8217;m not smeared with shame,</p>
<p>and the course of my life is free of blemish.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s no sad expression on my face,</p>
<p>and I don&#8217;t sit grimly with a frown on my brow,</p>
<p>still my reputation&#8217;s spotless, and as yet, without sin,</p>
<p>I entertain myself, and no adulterer has my approval.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the more surprised you&#8217;ve confidence in your attempt,</p>
<p>and that it&#8217;s given you reason to hope to share my bed.</p>
<p>Perhaps because Neptune&#8217;s hero, Theseus, took me by force,</p>
<p>once taken I&#8217;m thought worthy of being taken twice?</p>
<p>If I&#8217;d been seduced, the crime would have been mine:</p>
<p>since I was forced, what was I but unwilling?</p>
<p>He still didn&#8217;t get from his deed the fruits he sought:</p>
<p>I returned untouched except by fear.</p>
<p>The insolent man only stole a few kisses:</p>
<p>he had nothing further from me.</p>
<p>Your wickedness mightn&#8217;t have been content with that.</p>
<p>The gods help me! He wasn&#8217;t like you.</p>
<p>He returned me intact, and his restraint lessened the crime,</p>
<p>and it&#8217;s obvious the young man repented of his actions.</p>
<p>Did Theseus repent, so that Paris might succeed him,</p>
<p>so that my name would always be on men&#8217;s lips?</p>
<p>Yet I&#8217;m not angry &#8211; who&#8217;s angered by a lover? -</p>
<p>If only the love you show for me isn&#8217;t false.</p>
<p>Indeed I doubt that too, not because assurance is lacking,</p>
<p>or that my beauty&#8217;s not well-known to me,</p>
<p>but because credulity&#8217;s usually harmful to girls</p>
<p>and they say your words lack truth.</p>
<p>It may be said others sin, and a chaste woman&#8217;s rare.</p>
<p>Why is my name forbidden to be among the rare ones?</p>
<p>Or that my mother seems suited to you, by whose example</p>
<p>you may think you can sway me too: it&#8217;s an error: my mother</p>
<p>accepted love-making while under a false illusion:</p>
<p>the adulterer was hidden by a swan&#8217;s plumage.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t pretend ignorance, if I sin: nor would there be any error</p>
<p>that could screen the fact of my crime.</p>
<p>She erred in good faith, and the wrong was redeemed by its author.</p>
<p>For what Jove could I be said to be happily at fault?</p>
<p>And you mention your race, forebears, your royal name:</p>
<p>this house is distinguished enough in its nobility.</p>
<p>Not to speak of Jupiter, my husband&#8217;s ancestor, and all the glory</p>
<p>of Pelops, Tantalus&#8217;s son, and of Tyndareus:</p>
<p>Leda, deceived by the swan, gave me Jupiter for a father,</p>
<p>she who trustingly fondled the illusory bird in her lap.</p>
<p>Now go on telling me of the distant origin of the Phrygian race</p>
<p>and of Priam and his father Laomedon!</p>
<p>I admire them: but he who&#8217;s your greatest glory is fifth in line</p>
<p>from you: Jupiter, who would be first in line from my name.</p>
<p>Though I suppose your sceptre to be a power in your land,</p>
<p>yet I don&#8217;t think ours is less mighty.</p>
<p>If indeed the place outdoes this one in wealth and numbers of men,</p>
<p>certainly yours is a barbarous country.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true your letter offers such rich gifts</p>
<p>that they might move the gods themselves.</p>
<p>But if I wished now to cross the bounds of modesty,</p>
<p>you yourself would be a better reason for my sin.</p>
<p>Either I&#8217;ll keep my name forever without stain</p>
<p>or I&#8217;ll follow you rather than your gifts.</p>
<p>While I don&#8217;t reject them, gifts are always the most acceptable</p>
<p>when the author of them has made them precious.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s more that you love me, that I&#8217;m the reason for your labours,</p>
<p>that you come in hope, over such wastes of water.</p>
<p>Also, persistent man, I notice what you do now</p>
<p>when the tables are laid, though I try to pretend -</p>
<p>when you only look at me with your eyes, impudent, bold,</p>
<p>the gaze which my eyes can scarcely bear,</p>
<p>and now you sigh, and now you take the cup nearest me,</p>
<p>and where I drank from, you drink from that place too.</p>
<p>Ah, how many times I&#8217;ve seen your fingers, how many times,</p>
<p>giving secret signals, and your eyebrows almost speaking!</p>
<p>And often I&#8217;ve been fearful lest my husband might see it,</p>
<p>and I blushed at the signs you didn&#8217;t sufficiently hide.</p>
<p>Often I&#8217;ve whispered or, not even aloud, I&#8217;ve said:</p>
<p>&#8216;This man has no shame!&#8217; nor did that voice deceive me.</p>
<p>Also I&#8217;ve read, on our corner of the table beneath my name,</p>
<p>what the letters, composed with wine, spelt: &#8216;I love.&#8217;</p>
<p>I still refused to believe it, giving a look of denial.</p>
<p>Ah me, now I&#8217;ve learnt how to speak in that manner!</p>
<p>These are the blandishments, if I&#8217;d been sinful, that might</p>
<p>have deflected me: these might have captured my heart.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also I confess your rare beauty: and a girl</p>
<p>could want to fall into your embrace.</p>
<p>But some other might be made happier, without sinning,</p>
<p>rather than that my honour fall to a foreign lover.</p>
<p>Only, learn by example to be able to do without beauty:</p>
<p>virtue is to refrain from self-indulgent pleasures.</p>
<p>How many young men, do you think, wish for what you wish for?</p>
<p>Are they wise, or is Paris the only one with eyes?</p>
<p>You see no more than them, but you dare more rashly:</p>
<p>you&#8217;ve no more judgement, but less composure.</p>
<p>I wish that your swift ship had come then,</p>
<p>when a thousand suitors sought my virginity.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;d seen you, you&#8217;d have been first among the thousand:</p>
<p>my husband himself will pardon my opinion.</p>
<p>You come late, to delights already taken and possessed:</p>
<p>you hope was tardy: what you seek another has.</p>
<p>Though I chose to become your bride in Troy,</p>
<p>Menelaus does not hold me here unwillingly.</p>
<p>I beg you, stop tearing my heart apart sweetly with your words,</p>
<p>don&#8217;t hurt me, whom you say you love:</p>
<p>but allow me to keep the situation fate has granted,</p>
<p>and don&#8217;t shamefully make a prize of my honour.</p>
<p>But Venus agreed this, and in the deep valleys of Ida</p>
<p>three naked goddesses showed themselves to you:</p>
<p>and while one offered a kingdom, and another fame in battle,</p>
<p>the third said: &#8216;Helen will be your bride!&#8217;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe, for my part, that those heavenly bodies</p>
<p>were presented to you for judgement on their beauty:</p>
<p>if it were true, certainly the rest is fiction,</p>
<p>that I was said to be the prize for your judgement.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have enough confidence in my body to think that I</p>
<p>might have been the finest gift the goddess could call on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m content that men&#8217;s eyes approve my beauty:</p>
<p>Venus praising me would be a cause of envy.</p>
<p>But I won&#8217;t refute a thing: I favour your praise too:</p>
<p>For, heart, why reject the voice that is desired?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be angry if my belief in you comes only with great difficulty:</p>
<p>trust in important things usually builds slowly.</p>
<p>My prime pleasure is to have so pleased Venus:</p>
<p>the next, that you saw me as the greatest prize,</p>
<p>and preferred neither Hera&#8217;s nor Athene&#8217;s offerings</p>
<p>to the charms of Helen you had heard of.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m excellence to you, I&#8217;m a noble kingdom?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be made of iron, if I didn&#8217;t love your heart.</p>
<p>Believe me, I&#8217;m not of iron: but I resist loving</p>
<p>he whom I think could scarcely be mine.</p>
<p>Why plough the wet sands with curving blade,</p>
<p>or try to chase hopes that this situation denies?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m innocent of the affairs of Venus, and I never -</p>
<p>may the gods be my witness! &#8211; play tricks on my husband!</p>
<p>Now too, as I entrust my words to the silent page,</p>
<p>this letter performs a new service.</p>
<p>Happy, those who are used to these things! I know nothing of them,</p>
<p>I suspect the path of sin is difficult.</p>
<p>Fear is itself wrong: I&#8217;m confused now,</p>
<p>and I think all eyes are on my face.</p>
<p>Nor do I think it false: I sense the hostile murmurs of the people,</p>
<p>and Aethra brings me news of what they say.</p>
<p>But hide your love, unless you prefer to end it?</p>
<p>Why end it? You can dissimulate.</p>
<p>Indulge, but secretly! I&#8217;m given more freedom</p>
<p>though not total, because Menelaus is away.</p>
<p>In fact business required him to travel abroad,</p>
<p>there was a great, and valid, cause for his sudden journey:</p>
<p>or so it seemed to me. When he hesitated about going,</p>
<p>I said: &#8216;Go, and return quickly!&#8217; Pleased by this</p>
<p>he kissed me, saying: &#8216;Care for the house,</p>
<p>and business, and for the Trojan guest.&#8217;</p>
<p>I could scarcely hold my laughter, which, with a struggle,</p>
<p>I suppressed, and could say nothing except; &#8216;It shall be.&#8217;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true he sailed for Crete with a following wind:</p>
<p>but don&#8217;t think everything is as you&#8217;d wish!</p>
<p>When my husband&#8217;s away like this, absent he still guards me,</p>
<p>or don&#8217;t you realise a king&#8217;s hands have a long reach?</p>
<p>Also beauty is a burden: now I&#8217;m constantly praised</p>
<p>by your people&#8217;s mouths, he&#8217;s rightly more anxious.</p>
<p>That same glory I delight in, as it now is, harms me,</p>
<p>and it would have been better to have foregone fame.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be amazed that he&#8217;s gone, leaving me with you:</p>
<p>he trusts my virtue and my way of life.</p>
<p>He fears my looks, relies on my habits:</p>
<p>my goodness makes him feel secure, my beauty scares him.</p>
<p>You anticipate a later time beforehand, lest it&#8217;s lost,</p>
<p>so as to take advantage of my foolish husband.</p>
<p>And I both desire and fear, and my inclination&#8217;s not yet clear</p>
<p>enough: my mind hesitates, with doubt.</p>
<p>And my husband&#8217;s away, and you sleep without a partner,</p>
<p>your beauty captivates me, mine in turn captivates you:</p>
<p>and the nights are long, and now we meet to talk,</p>
<p>and you, ah me! flatter, and we share one house.</p>
<p>And let me perish if everything does not invite my sin:</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why I delay, but for the fear itself.</p>
<p>I wish you could rightly compel, what you wrongly persuade!</p>
<p>My awkwardness should have been overcome by force.</p>
<p>Sometimes a wrong benefits those who suffer it.</p>
<p>so I might have been compelled to be happy.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s new, we should fight love&#8217;s inception the more!</p>
<p>A fresh flame dies sprinkled with a little water.</p>
<p>Love&#8217;s not certain in a guest: it wanders, like himself,</p>
<p>and, when you think nothing&#8217;s more certain, vanishes.</p>
<p>Hypsipyle&#8217;s a witness, and Ariadne, the Minoan virgin:</p>
<p>both of them dallied in illicit beds.</p>
<p>You also, unfaithful man, have abandoned Oenone,</p>
<p>they say, your delight for many years.</p>
<p>You have still not denied it: and if you don&#8217;t know</p>
<p>it was my first care to search out everything about you.</p>
<p>Added to which, if you wished to stay true in love,</p>
<p>you couldn&#8217;t. Your Phrygians are readying your sails:</p>
<p>while you speak to me, while you arrange the hoped-for night,</p>
<p>a breeze will come, to carry you soon to your homeland.</p>
<p>you&#8217;ll abandon complete delight in the midst of its newness:</p>
<p>our love will be gone with the wind.</p>
<p>Or should I follow, as you argue, and see the Troy you praise,</p>
<p>and be the granddaughter-in-law of great Laomedon?</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t take the noise of rumour&#8217;s wings so lightly,</p>
<p>if the countries were full of my unchastity.</p>
<p>What would Sparta say of me, all Achaia,</p>
<p>the peoples of Asia, and your Troy?</p>
<p>What would Priam and Hecuba feel about me,</p>
<p>and all your brothers, and Trojan daughters-in-law?</p>
<p>You too, how could you hope for me to be faithful</p>
<p>and not be anxious at your own example?</p>
<p>Every stranger entering a Trojan port,</p>
<p>would be a source of troublesome fear to you.</p>
<p>How often, angry with me, you&#8217;d cry: &#8216;Adulteress!&#8217;</p>
<p>forgetting my guilt also belongs to you!</p>
<p>You&#8217;d become at once the author and critic of the offence.</p>
<p>Before that may the earth cover my face!</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ll enjoy Troy&#8217;s wealth and rich culture</p>
<p>and I&#8217;ll bear gifts more copious than you promised:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be offered purple-dyed and precious fabrics,</p>
<p>and I&#8217;ll be rich in heaped weights of gold!</p>
<p>Forgive this confession! Your gifts aren&#8217;t worth that much to me:</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know this land that would hold me at all.</p>
<p>Who will rush to help me, if I&#8217;m hurt, on Phrygian shores?</p>
<p>Where will I find a brother or father&#8217;s aid?</p>
<p>Jason, the deceiver, promised Medea everything:</p>
<p>wasn&#8217;t she driven out, no less, from Aeson&#8217;s house?</p>
<p>There was no Aeetes, to whom, scorned, she might return,</p>
<p>no mother, Idyia, no sister, Chalciope.</p>
<p>I fear nothing like that, but nor did Medea fear:</p>
<p>often hope&#8217;s deceived by its own presentiments of good.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find the sea in harbour was calm for every ship</p>
<p>that&#8217;s now tossed about in the deep.</p>
<p>That torch of blood terrifies me too, that your mother saw</p>
<p>born to her, before your day of birth:</p>
<p>and I fear the seer&#8217;s warning, who prophesied, it&#8217;s said,</p>
<p>that Troy would be burnt by a Pelasgian fire.</p>
<p>And as Venus favours you, because she triumphed, and holds</p>
<p>the double trophy through your choice (the apple and her beauty),</p>
<p>so I am afraid of those other two, if your boast is true,</p>
<p>who, through your decision, lost their cause:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve no doubt, if I followed you, war would be prepared.</p>
<p>Our love would travel among weapons, alas!</p>
<p>Perhaps Hippodamia of Atrax was the cause that forced</p>
<p>the Thessalian warriors into savage war with the Centaurs:</p>
<p>do you think Menelaus would be slow to righteous anger</p>
<p>or the Twins, his brothers-in-law, or Tyndareus?</p>
<p>For all your talk and tales of brave deeds</p>
<p>your beauty conflicts with your words.</p>
<p>Your body&#8217;s fitter for Venus than Mars.</p>
<p>Let the brave wage war, you, Paris, always love!</p>
<p>Command Hector, whom you praise, to fight for you:</p>
<p>your skills are in another kind of battle.</p>
<p>If I were to taste of them, and were a little braver,</p>
<p>I might enjoy them: if any girl tastes them, she might.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, abandoning shame, I might taste them</p>
<p>and, hesitation conquered by time, give you my hand.</p>
<p>I know what you seek: to tell me this, privately, in person:</p>
<p>what you might attempt to win, and invite in conversation:</p>
<p>But you&#8217;re too hasty, and as yet green shoots are your harvest.</p>
<p>Perhaps a fond delay would be to your liking.</p>
<p>Enough: now let these words, which share the mysteries</p>
<p>of my secret heart, cease with my weary fingers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll speak the rest through my friends Clymene and Aethra,</p>
<p>who are my two companions, and my counsel.</p>
<p>XVIII: Leander to Hero
</p>
<p>Hero, accept, from Leander&#8217;s hand, while he himself comes,</p>
<p>what he&#8217;d have wished to bear through the customary waves.</p>
<p>From one of Abydos, greetings, girl of Sestos, which he&#8217;d prefer</p>
<p>to bring to you, if only the waves would abate.</p>
<p>If the fates are good to me, if the gods accompany me with love,</p>
<p>you&#8217;ll read these words with indifferent eyes.</p>
<p>But the fates aren&#8217;t kind: why now would they delay my pledge,</p>
<p>not allowing me to hurry to you through familiar waters?</p>
<p>You yourself can see the sky blacker than pitch, and the strait</p>
<p>troubled by winds, and ships hardly venturing the deeps.</p>
<p>One boatman, and he&#8217;s daring, by whom my letter</p>
<p>is delivered to you, makes his way from harbour.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d have embarked with him, except that when he cast off</p>
<p>the lines from the stern, he was in view from all Abydos.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have been masked from my parents, as before,</p>
<p>and the love we wish to conceal wouldn&#8217;t have been hidden.</p>
<p>As soon as I wrote this, I said: &#8216;Go, happy letter!</p>
<p>now she&#8217;ll reach out her lovely hand for you.</p>
<p>Perhaps she&#8217;ll even touch you, with her snow-white teeth,</p>
<p>bringing you to her lips, when she wishes to break your seal.&#8217;</p>
<p>I spoke these words to myself in a low murmur,</p>
<p>while the rest of the sheet was indicated by my right hand.</p>
<p>But how I&#8217;d prefer that this hand, that writes, might swim</p>
<p>and carry me faithfully through familiar waters!</p>
<p>However apt it is as a servant of my feelings,</p>
<p>it&#8217;s better in fact at making strokes in the placid sea:</p>
<p>For seven nights, a space of time longer to me than a year,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been disturbed, as the troubled ocean raged with cruel waves.</p>
<p>If my mind has seen gentle sleep through those nights,</p>
<p>may this delay caused by the raging straits be a long one.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sitting on a rock, sadly gazing at your other shore</p>
<p>and I&#8217;m carried in mind to where my body cannot go.</p>
<p>Indeed my keen watchful eye either sees</p>
<p>or thinks it sees the summit to your tower.</p>
<p>Three times I&#8217;ve left my clothes on the dry sands:</p>
<p>three times, naked, painfully, I&#8217;ve tried to swim the roads:</p>
<p>the swollen sea opposed my youthful undertaking,</p>
<p>and, swimming against the waves, my head was submerged.</p>
<p>But you, wildest of the swift winds, why do you,</p>
<p>with fixed purpose, wage war against me?</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t see it, Boreas, you rage against me not the waves.</p>
<p>What might you do if love was not known to you?</p>
<p>Icy though you may be, cruel one, still, can you deny</p>
<p>that you once glowed with Greek fire?</p>
<p>What joy in plundering would you have known</p>
<p>if the airy approaches had wished to shut you out?</p>
<p>Spare me, I beg you, and release a more gentle breeze!</p>
<p>And let Aeolus not command anything offensive to you!</p>
<p>I beg in vain: he roars in answer to my prayers</p>
<p>and holds in check no part of the waters he&#8217;s stirred.</p>
<p>Now I wish Daedalus might give me bold wings!</p>
<p>Though the shores of the Icarian Sea are not far from here.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d suffer whatever might be, if only my body, that often hangs</p>
<p>above the uncertain water, might be lifted into the air.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while winds and waves deny all,</p>
<p>I agitate my mind with the first moments of my secret affair.</p>
<p>Night was falling &#8211; indeed I remember the pleasure of it -</p>
<p>when, a lover, I slipped from my father&#8217;s door.</p>
<p>Without delay, shedding my clothes, and with them my fear,</p>
<p>I calmly slid my arms into the flowing water.</p>
<p>The moon offered only a trembling light, to my going,</p>
<p>like an obliging companion on the road.</p>
<p>I looked up to her, and said: &#8216;Favour me, bright goddess,</p>
<p>and let the cliffs of Latmia suggest themselves to your mind.</p>
<p>Endymion would not allow you to be hard-hearted:</p>
<p>I beg you, turn your face to my secret enterprise!</p>
<p>Goddess, you came down from the sky to seek a mortal:</p>
<p>may I speak truth! &#8211; She whom I follow is herself a goddess.</p>
<p>Without calling to mind her virtues, worthy of the gods,</p>
<p>her beauty doesn&#8217;t appear except among true goddesses.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no greater loveliness than hers, after yours and Venus&#8217;s:</p>
<p>if you don&#8217;t believe my words, look for yourself!</p>
<p>By as much as all the stars yield to your fires</p>
<p>when you shine out, silver, with clear rays,</p>
<p>so much more beautiful than all the beauties is she:</p>
<p>if you doubt it, Cynthia, your eye is blind.&#8217;</p>
<p>I spoke these words or ones not unlike them,</p>
<p>the waters I shouldered parting before me, of themselves.</p>
<p>The waves shone with the image of the reflected moon</p>
<p>and it was bright as day in the silent night.</p>
<p>There was no voice anywhere: nothing came to my ears,</p>
<p>except the murmur of the waters, parted by my body.</p>
<p>Halycons alone appeared, lamenting to me,</p>
<p>sweetly, remembering dear Ceyx.</p>
<p>Then, both my arms growing weary, at the shoulder,</p>
<p>I raised myself strongly, high above the waves.</p>
<p>Seeing a distant light, I said: &#8216;My fire is in that fire:</p>
<p>that is the shore that holds my light.&#8217;</p>
<p>And sudden strength returned to my weary arms,</p>
<p>and the waves seemed calmer to me.</p>
<p>Love aids me, warming my eager heart,</p>
<p>so I will not be chilled by the deep cold.</p>
<p>I am more vigorous and the shore comes nearer,</p>
<p>as the distance grows less, my joy increases.</p>
<p>When I can see you clearly, your watching</p>
<p>gives me strength, and adds to my courage.</p>
<p>Now, to please my lady, I labour to swim,</p>
<p>and lift up my arms to catch your sight.</p>
<p>Your nurse can hardly stop you plunging into the deep.</p>
<p>This I saw too, it was not something I was told of.</p>
<p>Though she held you from going, she could not stop you,</p>
<p>nor prevent your feet being wet by the wave&#8217;s edge.</p>
<p>You embrace me, and join in happy kisses -</p>
<p>kisses, great gods, worth seeking over the sea!</p>
<p>Then you surrender to me the shawl from your shoulders,</p>
<p>and dry my hair drenched by the showers of brine.</p>
<p>The rest night knows, and we, and the tower that sees,</p>
<p>and the light that showed me a path through the sea.</p>
<p>The joys of that night can no more be counted</p>
<p>than the seaweeds in the waters of Hellespont:</p>
<p>how brief the time granted us for that secret passion,</p>
<p>how great the care that it was not wasted.</p>
<p>Soon Aurora, Tithonus&#8217;s bride, would chase away the night:</p>
<p>Lucifer paving the way, was in the sky:</p>
<p>we shower hasty kisses, quickly, without thought,</p>
<p>and complain how little the night lingers.</p>
<p>And so, delaying until the nurse&#8217;s cross warning,</p>
<p>leaving the tower, I seek the cold shore.</p>
<p>We part weeping, and I re-enter virgin Helle&#8217;s waters,</p>
<p>looking back at my lady, when I can, all the way.</p>
<p>If truth be known, coming to you from here I was a swimmer,</p>
<p>when I returned, I seemed to myself like a drowning man.</p>
<p>This too, if you would believe it: to you the way seemed smooth:</p>
<p>from you returning, a hill of inert water.</p>
<p>I return, unwillingly, to my country: who would believe it?</p>
<p>Now truly I linger in my city unwillingly.</p>
<p>Ah me! Why are our hearts that joined severed by the waves,</p>
<p>two of one mind but not of one country?</p>
<p>Your Sestos should take me, or my Abydos you:</p>
<p>your land pleases me, as much as mine pleases you.</p>
<p>Why am I troubled, when the sea is troubled?</p>
<p>How can a slight cause, the wind, oppose me?</p>
<p>Now the curved dolphins know of our affairs,</p>
<p>nor do I think I&#8217;m unknown to all the fish.</p>
<p>Now my worn path through the solitary waves is familiar,</p>
<p>no different to a road traversed by many wheels.</p>
<p>Before, I complained that this was the only way for me:</p>
<p>but now I also complain that I fail because of the wind.</p>
<p>Helle&#8217;s waters whiten with unruly waves,</p>
<p>and scarcely a boat remains safe at its moorings.</p>
<p>I think this sea was found like this, when first</p>
<p>it took its name from the drowned virgin.</p>
<p>This place is infamous enough from Helle&#8217;s loss,</p>
<p>and though it spares me, it has an evil name.</p>
<p>I envy Phrixus, carried safely over stormy seas,</p>
<p>on the golden ram, with its woolly fleece:</p>
<p>nevertheless I don&#8217;t need the services of a ram, or a boat,</p>
<p>provided these waters are given me, that my body parts.</p>
<p>Nothing&#8217;s done by artifice: only by the means to swim,</p>
<p>riding the waves, I&#8217;m both sailor and ship,</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t follow, Helice, the Great Bear, or Arctos, the Little Bear</p>
<p>that men of Tyre use: my love needs no visible stars.</p>
<p>Some other can gaze at Andromeda, or bright Corona Borealis,</p>
<p>or Callisto&#8217;s Bear shining at the frozen pole:</p>
<p>But it does not please me for the loves of Perseus,</p>
<p>Bacchus, or Jove, to be the judges of my dangerous path.</p>
<p>Another light&#8217;s more certain for me: my love,</p>
<p>that guides me, doesn&#8217;t wander in the darkness.</p>
<p>While I gaze on it, I might swim to Colchis, furthest Pontus,</p>
<p>and where the Thessalian ship, the Argo made its way,</p>
<p>and I might outdo young Palaemon, and Glaucus</p>
<p>whom a bite of grass made suddenly a god.</p>
<p>Exhausted, I can scarcely drag myself through the vast waters,</p>
<p>and often my arms are wearied by the endless motion.</p>
<p>When I tell them: &#8216;The reward for your labours will not be small,</p>
<p>soon it will be granted you to embrace your lady&#8217;s neck,&#8217;</p>
<p>they gain strength right away, and strain for the prize,</p>
<p>like swift horses of Elis, released from the starting gate.</p>
<p>So I serve my passions, with which I&#8217;m burnt,</p>
<p>and follow you the more, girl worthy of the heavens.</p>
<p>True you are worthy of the heavens, but linger still on earth,</p>
<p>or tell me which is indeed the way to the gods!</p>
<p>You are here, and have only a wretchedly small part of your lover,</p>
<p>and when the sea is stirred, my mind is stirred.</p>
<p>What good is it to me that no great width of sea divides us?</p>
<p>Does so narrow a stretch of water obstruct me less?</p>
<p>I wonder if I&#8217;d prefer to be a whole world distant,</p>
<p>when the hope I have of my lady is also far away.</p>
<p>Now, because we are nearer, I burn with a nearer flame,</p>
<p>and the hope, but not the thing itself, is always near me.</p>
<p>I almost touch what I love with my hand: it is so near:</p>
<p>but often, alas, that &#8216;almost&#8217; moves me to tears!</p>
<p>How is it different, I say, to snatching at intangible fruit,</p>
<p>or chasing the hope of vanishing water with one&#8217;s mouth?</p>
<p>In that way, am I never to hold you, unless the waves wish it,</p>
<p>and is the storm never to see me happy,</p>
<p>and, when nothing&#8217;s less permanent than wind or wave,</p>
<p>are my hopes always to be with wind and water?</p>
<p>It is still summer. What when the Pleiades, and Boot&euml;s,</p>
<p>and Capella&#8217;s Kids wound me and the waters?</p>
<p>Either I haven&#8217;t learnt how rash I might be,</p>
<p>or, then too, incautious Love will send me into the sea:</p>
<p>If you think I vow it only because the time is not yet ripe,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give you an assurance of my promise without delay.</p>
<p>Let the tides be still as high as now for a few nights more,</p>
<p>and I&#8217;ll try to cross the uninviting waters.</p>
<p>Either I&#8217;ll reach happiness, through courage, in safety,</p>
<p>or death will make an end of anxious love.</p>
<p>I wish nevertheless to be thrown on that shore</p>
<p>and my drowned body reach your harbour.</p>
<p>For you&#8217;ll weep, and think my body worthy to be touched</p>
<p>and you&#8217;ll say: &#8216;I was the cause of this man&#8217;s death!&#8217;</p>
<p>No doubt you might be grieved by an omen of my death,</p>
<p>and this part of my letter might be hateful to you.</p>
<p>Enough: refrain from complaint. But let your prayer</p>
<p>agree with mine, I beg, that the sea indeed ends its wrath.</p>
<p>A brief lull is needed for me to cross to you:</p>
<p>when I touch your shore let the storm rage on!</p>
<p>There is the right harbour for my keel,</p>
<p>and no better waters exist for my vessel.</p>
<p>There let the North Wind shut me in, where delay is sweet:</p>
<p>There I&#8217;ll be reluctant to swim, there I&#8217;ll be cautious,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll not cry out against the unheeding waves,</p>
<p>nor complain the sea is harsh for swimming.</p>
<p>Let both the winds and your tender arms hold me equally,</p>
<p>and I&#8217;ll be hindered by both causes.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;ve suffered the storm, I&#8217;ll use my arms as oars:</p>
<p>only always keep your light in sight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile let this stay with you, all night, instead of me,</p>
<p>this letter, that I pray, myself, to follow, with the least delay.</p>
<p>XIX: Hero to Leander
</p>
<p>Come! That I might have, in fact, the greetings</p>
<p>that you sent to me in words.</p>
<p>All waiting is long to us, that delays our joy.</p>
<p>Forgive my confession: I&#8217;m not patient in my love.</p>
<p>We blaze with equal fire, but I&#8217;m unequal to you in strength:</p>
<p>I suspect that a man is stronger by nature.</p>
<p>Like their bodies, the wills of tender girls are weaker:</p>
<p>add a little more time for delay, and I&#8217;ll fail.</p>
<p>You men, now hunting, now farming pleasant country,</p>
<p>spend many hours in various pastimes.</p>
<p>Either the market occupies you or, oiled, you&#8217;re bent at the skills</p>
<p>of wrestling, or you guide your horse&#8217;s neck with a bridle:</p>
<p>now you trap a bird, now draw a fish to your hook,</p>
<p>now dilute the wine that circles in the twilight hours.</p>
<p>These are denied me: even if I were less fiercely on fire,</p>
<p>nothing remains for me but to do what I do, to love.</p>
<p>What I do remains, and you, o my sole delight, I love,</p>
<p>more too than you may be able to give back to me.</p>
<p>I whisper about you with my white-haired nurse,</p>
<p>and ponder the reason for your delayed passage:</p>
<p>or I watch the sea stirred by hostile winds</p>
<p>reproving the waves almost with the words you use:</p>
<p>or when the waves slacken their weight of savagery a little,</p>
<p>I complain, it&#8217;s true, that you can come, but don&#8217;t want to:</p>
<p>while I complain tears trickle from my loving eyes,</p>
<p>and the old nurse, who knows, dries them with trembling hand.</p>
<p>Often I look to see if your footprints might mark the shore,</p>
<p>as if the sand might retain the marks traced there:</p>
<p>and to ask about you and write to you, I search out, if anyone</p>
<p>might be coming from Abydos, or going to Abydos.</p>
<p>Why recall how many times I kiss the garments</p>
<p>that you left when you plunged into the Hellespont&#8217;s waters?</p>
<p>So when day&#8217;s done, and night&#8217;s more friendly hour</p>
<p>shows its bright stars, driving away the daylight,</p>
<p>straight away I set out the unsleeping lights in the tower&#8217;s top,</p>
<p>signs and tokens of your familiar path,</p>
<p>and we beguile the long wait with feminine art,</p>
<p>twisting the threads drawn from the turning spindle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I search for what to talk of in those long hours:</p>
<p>nothing but Leander&#8217;s name is on my lips.</p>
<p>&#8216;Nurse, do you think my joy has left his house now,</p>
<p>or perhaps they are all awake, and he&#8217;s afraid of them?</p>
<p>Now do you think perhaps he slips the clothes from his shoulders,</p>
<p>and rubs olive oil now over all his limbs?&#8217;</p>
<p>She gives a nod: she doesn&#8217;t care about my kisses,</p>
<p>but moves her head, sleep stealing upon the old woman.</p>
<p>After the slightest pause, I say: &#8216;Now he&#8217;s swimming, for sure,</p>
<p>and his slow arms are cleaving the water.&#8217;</p>
<p>And, while the few threads I&#8217;ve finished fall to the floor,</p>
<p>I ask if you can have reached mid-strait perhaps.</p>
<p>And now I look out, and now I pray in a fearful voice,</p>
<p>that favourable winds grant you an easy passage:</p>
<p>I hear uncertain cries and I think that every noise</p>
<p>might be the sound of your arrival.</p>
<p>So as the larger part of the night passes for me in illusion,</p>
<p>sleep stealthily overcomes my weary eyes.</p>
<p>Perhaps, cruel one, you&#8217;ll still sleep with me, unwillingly,</p>
<p>and though not wishing, yourself, to come, you&#8217;ll come.</p>
<p>Now you seem to be nearer, now I see you swimming,</p>
<p>now my shoulders bear your briny arms,</p>
<p>now, as I do, I give the clothes from my breast to your wet limbs,</p>
<p>now, joined to you, I warm you with my heart,</p>
<p>and much besides is concealed, by the modest tongue,</p>
<p>that&#8217;s ashamed to speak of things it delights in doing.</p>
<p>Alas! It&#8217;s brief and pleasure is untrue:</p>
<p>for you always leave me, as sleep does.</p>
<p>Oh, let&#8217;s bind our eager passions more firmly,</p>
<p>so that our joys lack nothing of faith and truth.</p>
<p>Why do I spend so many cold, empty nights?</p>
<p>Why are you so often, lingering slowly, absent from me?</p>
<p>I grant the sea&#8217;s not fit for swimming:</p>
<p>but last night the wind became more gentle.</p>
<p>Why did you neglect it? Why didn&#8217;t you dare to come?</p>
<p>Why did such a moment die, and you not seize the time?</p>
<p>May you soon be given many similar chances,</p>
<p>though this one was surely better than those before.</p>
<p>But the shape of the peaceful deep changes quickly.</p>
<p>When you hurried, you often came in less time than that.</p>
<p>I think if you were to be caught here you wouldn&#8217;t complain</p>
<p>and, with me holding you, the storm would do you no harm.</p>
<p>Then I&#8217;d joyfully listen to the sounding winds</p>
<p>and I&#8217;d pray for the waters never to be calm.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s happened then, why are you more fearful of the waves,</p>
<p>and are afraid now of the straits you despised before?</p>
<p>Now I remember, when the sea was no less, or a little less,</p>
<p>savage and threatening, you came:</p>
<p>when I cried to you: &#8216;You are so reckless,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be mourning your courage in misery.&#8217;</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s this new fear from, and that courage fleeing to?</p>
<p>Where is that great swimmer scorning the tides?</p>
<p>Still, be rather as you would be, than as you used to be before,</p>
<p>and make your way here safely in a calm sea -</p>
<p>Provided that you&#8217;re the same: let us love, so, as you write,</p>
<p>and may its flame never become cold ashes.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t greatly fear that the winds will delay my prayers,</p>
<p>but I fear lest your love strays like the wind,</p>
<p>or that I be not worthy, and the risk will outweigh my cause,</p>
<p>and the reward appear less to you than your labour.</p>
<p>At times I&#8217;m afraid lest my race harms me, and a Thracian girl</p>
<p>be considered unfit for marriage to Abydos.</p>
<p>Still, I could bear all things patiently, so long as I knew</p>
<p>you didn&#8217;t spend your time with a rival, captive, in idleness,</p>
<p>and no other&#8217;s arms came about your neck,</p>
<p>and no new love was ending our love.</p>
<p>Ah, let me rather die, than be wounded by that crime,</p>
<p>and my fate be charged with guilt before yours!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t say this because you&#8217;ve shown signs of it happening,</p>
<p>or because I&#8217;m distressed by some new rumour.</p>
<p>I fear everything! Who has ever been secure in love?</p>
<p>And distance creates more fear, for the absent.</p>
<p>Happy are they, whose presence commands knowledge</p>
<p>of true guilt, and prevents fear of falsehood.</p>
<p>So many vain things move me, wrong that&#8217;s done deceives,</p>
<p>and the sting of both errors equally rouses me.</p>
<p>Oh I wish you would come! Or let the cause of your delay</p>
<p>be the winds, for sure, or your father, and not some woman!</p>
<p>If I were to know that grief, I&#8217;d die, believe me:</p>
<p>sin at once if you seek my death.</p>
<p>But you will not sin, and I fear it foolishly,</p>
<p>also you don&#8217;t come because you fight a hostile storm.</p>
<p>Ah me! What a tide pounds this shore,</p>
<p>and the day is hidden, buried by a dark cloud!</p>
<p>Perhaps Nephele, Helle&#8217;s devoted mother, may have come</p>
<p>to the straits, and weeps for her drowned child, with the water&#8217;s flow:</p>
<p>or Ino, the stepmother, now a sea-goddess, stirs the sea,</p>
<p>that&#8217;s called by the name of her hated step-daughter?</p>
<p>As it is, this place is not kind to tender girls:</p>
<p>here Helle perished, here I&#8217;m wounded by the waters.</p>
<p>But remember your love-flames, Neptune,</p>
<p>and love won&#8217;t be hindered by the winds:</p>
<p>if the tale of your crimes against Amymone, and Tyro,</p>
<p>most praised for her beauty, are not vain,</p>
<p>and bright Alcyone, and Calyce, and Hecate&#8217;s daughter,</p>
<p>and Medusa before her hair was knotted with snakes,</p>
<p>and golden-haired Laodice, and Celaeno, received in heaven,</p>
<p>and other names I remember that I&#8217;ve read of.</p>
<p>Surely, the poets sing of these and more, Neptune,</p>
<p>who have joined their sweet flanks to yours.</p>
<p>So why have you, who so often felt the power of love,</p>
<p>closed the familiar path to us, with storms?</p>
<p>Spare us, proud one, and embroil yourself in battle out at sea:</p>
<p>this short passage separates our two lands.</p>
<p>You are suited to hurling about great ships with your might,</p>
<p>or even being fierce towards a whole fleet:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s shameful for the god of the sea to terrify a young swimmer,</p>
<p>and the glory&#8217;s less than that of the god of a pond somewhere.</p>
<p>In fact he&#8217;s noble and of a distinguished family,</p>
<p>but he draws nothing from Ulysses&#8217;s race, that you mistrust.</p>
<p>Take pity, and guard us both. He swims: but the same wave</p>
<p>carries the body of Leander and my hopes.</p>
<p>The light splutters in fact &#8211; for I write where it&#8217;s placed -</p>
<p>it splutters, and thereby gives me a favourable sign.</p>
<p>See, onto the auspicious flame my nurse drops wine:</p>
<p>&#8216;Tomorrow,&#8217; she says, &#8216; there&#8217;ll be more of us&#8217;, and drinks the rest.</p>
<p>Make us more, gliding through the defeated waves,</p>
<p>oh you, received deep within me, by my whole heart!</p>
<p>Return to this camp, deserter from mutual love:</p>
<p>why should my body be left in the centre of the bed?</p>
<p>What I might fear: is not! Venus herself blesses you with courage,</p>
<p>and, born from the waves, she smoothes the sea-lanes.</p>
<p>Often I want to travel the midst of the waves myself,</p>
<p>but these straits are usually safer for men.</p>
<p>Why, if Phrixus and his sister Helle were carried over them,</p>
<p>did only the girl give her name to the desolate waters?</p>
<p>Perhaps you fear there&#8217;ll not be time for you to return,</p>
<p>or you won&#8217;t be able to endure the effort of a double journey.</p>
<p>But let us meet, from opposite directions, in mid-strait,</p>
<p>and exchange kisses, as we touch, on the crest of a wave,</p>
<p>and each return, once more, to the cities we came from:</p>
<p>that would be little, but better than nothing at all.</p>
<p>I wish this shame, that forces us to love in secret,</p>
<p>would end, or our love, fearful of reputation!</p>
<p>Now, the thing&#8217;s badly joined: passion and propriety conflict.</p>
<p>Which to follow&#8217;s in doubt: one is proper: the other gives joy.</p>
<p>When Jason, of Pagasa, once entered Colchis</p>
<p>he swiftly carried Medea away from Phasis, in his ship:</p>
<p>When Paris, of Ida, once came as an adulterer to Sparta,</p>
<p>he soon returned with Helen, his prize.</p>
<p>You, who so often seek whom you love, as often leave her,</p>
<p>and whenever it&#8217;s difficult for ships to sail, you swim.</p>
<p>In this way, o youth, conqueror of the swollen waters,</p>
<p>you scorn what the straits may do, though you fear them.</p>
<p>Ships built with skill can be sunk by the waters:</p>
<p>do you think your arms are more capable than oars?</p>
<p>What you desire: to swim, Leander: is what the sailor fears:</p>
<p>it&#8217;s usually the result for him of his ship being wrecked.</p>
<p>Ah me! I want to persuade you not to do as I urge,</p>
<p>and pray you&#8217;re stronger than my admonishments:</p>
<p>provided you&#8217;d come and throw those weary arms,</p>
<p>battered often by the waves, around my shoulders.</p>
<p>But whenever I turn towards the dark-blue waves</p>
<p>my fearful heart&#8217;s possessed by some unknown chill.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m troubled no less by last night&#8217;s dream,</p>
<p>though I&#8217;ve propitiated the gods with holy rites.</p>
<p>Just before dawn, when the lamp was sinking,</p>
<p>a time when true dreams are often experienced,</p>
<p>the slackened thread fell from my hands in sleep,</p>
<p>and I laid my head on the supporting pillow.</p>
<p>In it, without doubt, in true vision, I saw a dolphin</p>
<p>swimming along through the stormy waves:</p>
<p>then, when the flood had dashed it against the thirsty sands,</p>
<p>life, and the tide, together, abandoned the wretched creature,</p>
<p>Whatever it means, I&#8217;m frightened: don&#8217;t mock my dream</p>
<p>and don&#8217;t trust yourself to the sea unless it&#8217;s tranquil.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t spare yourself, spare your beloved girl,</p>
<p>who can never be safe unless you&#8217;re safe too.</p>
<p>Yet there&#8217;s hope of peace near in the weakening waves:</p>
<p>then you must divide the calm waters with your breast.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, since the straits are not passable by swimming,</p>
<p>let the letter I send ease the hateful hours of waiting.</p>
<p>XX: Acontius to Cydippe
</p>
<p>Cydippe, come now, receive despised Acontius -</p>
<p>he who deceived you with the apple.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t fear! You won&#8217;t swear another oath of love because of this: it&#8217;s enough that you once promised to be mine.</p>
<p>Read on! So may the illness vanish from your body:</p>
<p>that any part of it is grieved, is grief to me!</p>
<p>Why blush before you start? Since I suspect your noble cheeks</p>
<p>have reddened, as they did in Dian&#8217;s temple.</p>
<p>I ask not sin of you, but marriage and a true contract:</p>
<p>I love as one bound in marriage, not an adulterer.</p>
<p>You might recall the message, that the fruit from the tree</p>
<p>brought to your chaste hands, when I threw it to you:</p>
<p>there you&#8217;ll find you promised that which I&#8217;d wish for you,</p>
<p>virgin, rather than that which the goddess remembers.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s just the same (I fear), but yet the same in being stronger:</p>
<p>it grows in power, and the flame increases with delay,</p>
<p>and what was never small, is now vast with time,</p>
<p>and love is nurtured by the hope you&#8217;ve given me.</p>
<p>You gave me hope: my passion trusted you in this.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t deny the fact, as the goddess is my witness.</p>
<p>There, and in person, as she was, she noted your words,</p>
<p>and the movement of her hair seemed to allow them.</p>
<p>You can say you were deceived, by my trick,</p>
<p>as long as love&#8217;s shown to be the reason for it.</p>
<p>What did my offence seek except to be made one with you?</p>
<p>What you complain of is capable of uniting us.</p>
<p>Neither by nature or custom am I so cunning:</p>
<p>I believe that you make me clever, girl.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;ve achieved anything, ingenious Love,</p>
<p>joined you to me, binding you with my words.</p>
<p>I made the betrothal with words he dictated,</p>
<p>and was a lawyer, advised by devious Love.</p>
<p>Let the name of the action be fraud, and let it be called crafty,</p>
<p>if to desire what you love is held to be craft.</p>
<p>Look, I again write, and send you, words of pleading!</p>
<p>This letter&#8217;s another offence, and what you complain of, you hold.</p>
<p>I confess, if my love for you hurts you, I&#8217;ll hurt you endlessly,</p>
<p>and I&#8217;ll seek you continually, though you beware my seeking.</p>
<p>Other men have snatched lovely girls at sword-point:</p>
<p>is this letter I&#8217;ve written, thoughtfully, to be called a crime?</p>
<p>May the gods allow me to impose more ties on you,</p>
<p>so that your honour is in no way free.</p>
<p>A thousand wiles remain: I toil at the base of the hill:</p>
<p>my passion won&#8217;t let anything go untried.</p>
<p>Let it be unsure whether you can be caught: you&#8217;ll be caught for sure.</p>
<p>the outcome&#8217;s with the gods, but it&#8217;s still captivity.</p>
<p>Though you flee some you can&#8217;t escape all the nets,</p>
<p>many more than you think, that Love spreads for you.</p>
<p>If art is not enough, I&#8217;ll turn to arms,</p>
<p>and snatch you away, borne on my loving breast.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not one who&#8217;s accustomed to criticise Paris&#8217;s actions,</p>
<p>nor any man who played the husband to become one.</p>
<p>I too &#8211; but I say no more. Though death might be the punishment</p>
<p>for taking you, it would be better than not having you at all.</p>
<p>If you were less beautiful, then you&#8217;d be sought with restraint:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m driven to daring by your charms.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve done this, and your eyes, whose fires the stars</p>
<p>yield to, you who are the cause of my passion:</p>
<p>your golden hair has done this, and your ivory throat,</p>
<p>and your hands, that I pray will come about my neck,</p>
<p>and your comeliness, and your modest, and refined appearance,</p>
<p>and your ankles, such as I suppose Thetis&#8217;s scarcely to be.</p>
<p>I would be happier still, if I might praise the rest,</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t doubt, indeed, the whole is itself of equal art.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder, with this compelling beauty,</p>
<p>that I wished to hear you speak that pledge.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re finally forced to confess you&#8217;re caught,</p>
<p>then, be a girl captured by my trickery.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll suffer, if the suffering&#8217;s granted its prize.</p>
<p>Why should such a crime fail of its reward?</p>
<p>Telamon took Hesione: Achilles took Briseis:</p>
<p>certainly each of them followed her victorious lord.</p>
<p>As much as you may accuse me and be angered,</p>
<p>your anger would be allowed, as long as you enjoyed my company.</p>
<p>In the same way as I cause your anger, I&#8217;ll ease it,</p>
<p>a little of you might bring much reconciliation.</p>
<p>Let me weep before your eyes,</p>
<p>and add words to those tears,</p>
<p>so that, like a slave who fears a savage lashing,</p>
<p>I may stretch my submissive hands out at your feet!</p>
<p>Forgo your anger: summon me! Why condemn me in my absence?</p>
<p>Order me now to come at my lady&#8217;s whim.</p>
<p>Be pleased to tear my hair imperiously,</p>
<p>and let my face be bruised by your fingers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll endure anything: I only fear that your hand</p>
<p>might be wounded by striking my body so furiously.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t restrain me with fetters and chains:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m enslaved to you by true love.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve satisfied your anger as much as you wish,</p>
<p>you&#8217;ll say to yourself: &#8216;How patiently he loves!&#8217;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll say to yourself, when you see I endure it all:</p>
<p>&#8216;He who serves so well, he may serve me!&#8217;</p>
<p>Now unhappily I play the accused in my absence,</p>
<p>and my cause, though good, is lost, with no defence.</p>
<p>Also, let my letter have injured you as much as you wish,</p>
<p>you shouldn&#8217;t only complain of what you receive from me.</p>
<p>Diana doesn&#8217;t merit being disappointed as well: if you</p>
<p>don&#8217;t wish to repay your promise to me, repay the goddess.</p>
<p>She was there and she saw, how you blushed, deceived,</p>
<p>and the memory of your words remains in her ears.</p>
<p>Let the omens lack reality! None is more violent than her</p>
<p>when she sees, what I do not wish, her divinity offended.</p>
<p>The fierce Calydonian Boar is witness, though Althaea, that mother,</p>
<p>will be found to have been fiercer against Meleager, her son.</p>
<p>And Actaeon is witness, once taken to be a wild creature,</p>
<p>when granted the death himself, that he&#8217;d granted creatures before.</p>
<p>and also that proud mother, Niobe, her body rising as rock,</p>
<p>stands weeping, now, on the soil of Lydia.</p>
<p>Ah me! Cydippe, I fear to tell you the truth,</p>
<p>lest my cause appear a false one to you:</p>
<p>Still it should be said. I believe, you&#8217;re often ill,</p>
<p>thinking about the moment of marriage.</p>
<p>She protects your interests, she&#8217;s anxious lest you perjure yourself, and the goddess wishes you intact, your promise intact.</p>
<p>So that whenever you try to be unfaithful,</p>
<p>she then rectifies your error.</p>
<p>Beware of provoking the proud virgin&#8217;s cruel bow:</p>
<p>she can still be gentle, if you&#8217;ll allow it.</p>
<p>Beware, I pray, of wasting your tender body with fevers:</p>
<p>guard your beauty for my enjoyment.</p>
<p>Let the face, born to inflame me, be preserved,</p>
<p>and the slow blush of modesty entering snowy cheeks.</p>
<p>And if any of my enemies opposes your becoming mine,</p>
<p>let him be as you, in your weakness, are to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tormented equally whether it&#8217;s your marriage or sickness:</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say now which of them I least desire:</p>
<p>meanwhile I&#8217;m distressed, that I might be a cause of your pain,</p>
<p>and consider you to have been hurt by my cunning.</p>
<p>I pray that my lady&#8217;s perjury falls on my head:</p>
<p>let her be safe from my punishment!</p>
<p>Lest I&#8217;m ignorant what&#8217;s happening, I often, secretly,</p>
<p>in my anxiety, pass here and there, before your door:</p>
<p>I follow your maid and serving-boy, stealthily, asking</p>
<p>if sleep or food has benefited your health.</p>
<p>Alas for me that I can&#8217;t implement the doctor&#8217;s orders</p>
<p>or take your hand, or sit by your bed!</p>
<p>And more misery, that when I&#8217;m far away from there,</p>
<p>perhaps some other, whom I&#8217;d least wish, is present.</p>
<p>He takes your hand and, hated by the gods, and by me</p>
<p>as well as the gods, he sits by you in your illness,</p>
<p>and while he checks the pulse in your vein with his finger,</p>
<p>under this pretext, he holds your white arm,</p>
<p>and perhaps he touches your breast, and kisses you:</p>
<p>that reward is too much for his services.</p>
<p>Who allowed you to gather in my crops before time?</p>
<p>Who made a path for you to another&#8217;s hedge?</p>
<p>That breast is mine! You shamefully steal my kisses!</p>
<p>Take your hand from the body that was meant for me!</p>
<p>Wretch, take you hand away! What you touch is to be mine:</p>
<p>If you do that, shortly, you&#8217;ll be an adulterer.</p>
<p>Choose another from the single girls, one not yet claimed:</p>
<p>if you don&#8217;t know: this object has an owner.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to believe me: have the terms of our contract read:</p>
<p>let her read them, lest you should say they&#8217;re false.</p>
<p>Stranger to our bed I say, I say to you, leave!</p>
<p>What do you want here? Leave! This bed&#8217;s not free.</p>
<p>Though you have another contract now with identical words,</p>
<p>your cause is not for that reason equal to mine.</p>
<p>She first settled this with me, herself, her father settled with you:</p>
<p>but she&#8217;s surely closer to herself than her father.</p>
<p>Her father promised it, she swore herself to be in love:</p>
<p>in once case a man, in the other the goddess is witness.</p>
<p>He fears to be called a liar, she a perjurer:</p>
<p>do you doubt that the latter&#8217;s a greater fear than the first?</p>
<p>And if you should compare the risk to each,</p>
<p>look at their state: she lies sick, and he&#8217;s well.</p>
<p>You and I too come to this struggle with different feelings:</p>
<p>our hopes are not equal, are fears are not the same.</p>
<p>You venture in safety: to me rejection&#8217;s worse than death,</p>
<p>and I love her, now, whom you perhaps might.</p>
<p>If justice, or what is right, was your care,</p>
<p>you&#8217;d have conceded to my greater love.</p>
<p>Now that this cruel man, Cydippe, fights for his unjust cause,</p>
<p>to what theme should my letter return?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s he who made you ill, and mistrusted by Diana: given that,</p>
<p>if you&#8217;re wise, you won&#8217;t let him approach your threshold.</p>
<p>that you plunge into so many cruel risks to your life is his doing,</p>
<p>and I wish he who caused them might die instead of you!</p>
<p>If you immediately shun one whom the goddess condemns,</p>
<p>and don&#8217;t love him, I will be surely be fine.</p>
<p>Virgin, cease to fear! Only respect your firm promise, make sure</p>
<p>you worship in the temple that shares our knowledge:</p>
<p>the gods don&#8217;t delight in sacrificial oxen,</p>
<p>but loyalty that&#8217;s shown, and needs no witness.</p>
<p>Others to be well suffer steel and flame,</p>
<p>others endure the dismal aid of bitter juices.</p>
<p>You need none of these: shun such perjury and you&#8217;ll save</p>
<p>yourself, and me, and the pledge you gave!</p>
<p>Your ignorance of it will forgive your past sin:</p>
<p>the agreement you recited slipped from your mind.</p>
<p>Now you&#8217;re warned by my voice, now by this sickness,</p>
<p>that you&#8217;re accustomed to suffer whenever you try to deceive.</p>
<p>Do you think you might avoid calling on her in childbirth,</p>
<p>pleading that she might bring you her shining hands?</p>
<p>She&#8217;ll hear, and recalling what she&#8217;s heard, she&#8217;ll ask</p>
<p>what husband&#8217;s given you this child.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll promise gifts: she knows your promises are false.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll swear: she knows that you betray the gods.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not anxious for myself: I labour at a greater task.</p>
<p>My anxieties are caused by your love.</p>
<p>Why do your parents, doubtful for you, just weep in fear,</p>
<p>ignorant of what constitutes your sin?</p>
<p>And why are they ignorant? You might tell your mother all.</p>
<p>Your actions, Cydippe, should cause no blushes.</p>
<p>Make sure you tell her, in order, how you were first known to me</p>
<p>while she performed the rites of the quiver-bearing goddess:</p>
<p>how suddenly seeing you, if you clearly noticed,</p>
<p>I halted, my eyes gazing at your limbs:</p>
<p>and while I marvelled at you greatly, a sure sign of passion,</p>
<p>my cloak slipped from my shoulder and fell to the ground:</p>
<p>Presently an apple came rolling from I know not where,</p>
<p>bearing artful words in cunning letters:</p>
<p>which, being read out loud, in sacred Diana&#8217;s presence,</p>
<p>made your pledge binding, with her as divine witness.</p>
<p>Lest your mother&#8217;s still unsure how vital the words might be,</p>
<p>now also repeat what was once written to you.</p>
<p>She&#8217;ll say: &#8216;I beg you marry whoever the good gods joined you to:</p>
<p>whom you were sworn to, he&#8217;ll be my son-in-law.</p>
<p>Whoever he is, he&#8217;ll please us, since he pleased Diana before.&#8217;</p>
<p>So your mother will say if she&#8217;s truly your mother.</p>
<p>But see to it she enquires who I might be and what:</p>
<p>let her discover the goddess is looking out for you.</p>
<p>An island encircled by the Aegean Sea, is named Cea,</p>
<p>once celebrated for the Corcyrian nymphs.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my native land: nor can you condemn my ancestors</p>
<p>as ones to be despised, if you approve a noble name.</p>
<p>And they are rich, and their morals without stain:</p>
<p>and if there were nothing more, Love joined me to you.</p>
<p>You might have desired such a husband, even without your oath:</p>
<p>having sworn it, even if he were not such, he must be accepted.</p>
<p>Diana the huntress, in dream, ordered me to write these words:</p>
<p>Love, awake, ordered me to write them to you:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m already wounded, by the second one&#8217;s arrows,</p>
<p>you, beware lest the first one&#8217;s shafts harm you!</p>
<p>Our well-being is linked &#8211; take pity on yourself, and on me:</p>
<p>Why hesitate to bring one relief to both?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ll do this, when the signal&#8217;s sounded,</p>
<p>and Delos is drenched with sacrificial blood,</p>
<p>a golden image of the fortunate apple will be offered,</p>
<p>and the reason for the offering will be written in two short lines:</p>
<p>&#8216;With this likeness of an apple, Acontius bears witness</p>
<p>that what may have been written on it, has been done.&#8217;</p>
<p>Let your fragile body be wearied no longer by this letter,</p>
<p>and let it be closed with the usual ending: &#8216;Farewell!&#8217;</p>
<p>XXI: Cydippe to Acontius
</p>
<p>Your writing reached me Acontius, as it is wont to do,</p>
<p>and indeed it almost set a trap for my eyes.</p>
<p>I was fearful, and read your letter without a murmur,</p>
<p>lest my tongue unknowingly swore by some god.</p>
<p>And I think you might have set out to trap me again, except that,</p>
<p>as you confess yourself, you know one promise is enough for me.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have read it: but if I&#8217;d been harsh to you,</p>
<p>perhaps it might have increased the fierce goddess&#8217;s anger.</p>
<p>Though I do everything, though I burn sacred incense to Diana,</p>
<p>she still takes your part more than is right, and as you want it</p>
<p>to be thought, mindful of you, protects you with her anger:</p>
<p>She scarcely did more for Hippolytus himself.</p>
<p>But she might do better to favour my virgin years</p>
<p>which I fear she intends will be all too few.</p>
<p>Yes, weariness clings to me for no apparent reason,</p>
<p>and my fatigue&#8217;s not helped by any doctor&#8217;s cure.</p>
<p>Would you believe with what difficulty I write this meagre letter</p>
<p>to you now, or ease my pale limbs from lying in my bed?</p>
<p>Now an added fear, lest someone other than my knowing nurse</p>
<p>thinks that there&#8217;s a conversation between us.</p>
<p>She sits outside my door, and on being asked how I am, within,</p>
<p>says: &#8216;She&#8217;s sleeping,&#8217; so that I can write in safety.</p>
<p>Soon, when sleep, the best reason for extended privacy,</p>
<p>lacks credibility as an excuse, through the lengthy delay,</p>
<p>and she sees those arriving whom it would be hard not to admit,</p>
<p>she coughs and gives me the sign we agreed on.</p>
<p>So it goes: I hurriedly leave off my unfinished words,</p>
<p>and hide the letter I&#8217;ve started, against my anxious breast.</p>
<p>Then I weary my fingers again with repetition:</p>
<p>how much effort these words of mine are that you read.</p>
<p>May I die if you were worthy of my speaking truthfully:</p>
<p>but I&#8217;m more just to you than you deserve.</p>
<p>So, is it because of you my health is so uncertain</p>
<p>and I&#8217;m punished, and have been punished, for your deceit?</p>
<p>Is this the reward that comes, by your praise of marvellous beauty,</p>
<p>and harms me for having pleased you?</p>
<p>How I&#8217;d prefer it if I&#8217;d seemed deformed to you,</p>
<p>my blameworthy body would not have needed help:</p>
<p>now I grieve that I was praised, now you destroy me</p>
<p>with your rivalry, and I&#8217;m wounded by my own charm itself.</p>
<p>And you won&#8217;t concede, nor does he think himself inferior,</p>
<p>you obstruct his wishes, he obstructs yours.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tossed about like a boat, that the unerring North Wind</p>
<p>drives out into the deep, carried back by tide and surge.</p>
<p>And when the day&#8217;s here, that was chosen by my dear parents,</p>
<p>at the same time unruly passion&#8217;s in my body.</p>
<p>Now cruel Persephone beats harshly on my door,</p>
<p>at the very moment of my marriage.</p>
<p>Now I fear, and am ashamed, though not conscious of any guilt,</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t seem to have merited the gods being offended.</p>
<p>Some say this happened by chance, and others</p>
<p>deny that my husband&#8217;s acceptable to the heavens:</p>
<p>and lest you think there&#8217;s nothing of you too in the talk,</p>
<p>some of them think it was caused by your poisons.</p>
<p>The cause is hidden, my illness is obvious: you two</p>
<p>drive away peace, stir bitter conflict, I&#8217;m punished.</p>
<p>Tell me now, and don&#8217;t deceive me, as is your usual custom,</p>
<p>what might you do in hate, when you hurt me so with love?</p>
<p>If you wound one you love, you&#8217;d be wise to love your enemy:</p>
<p>I pray that, to save me, you might want to destroy your wish!</p>
<p>Either you&#8217;ve, now, no care for the girl you hoped for,</p>
<p>whom you cruelly allow to die from a shameful illness,</p>
<p>or, if you&#8217;ve asked the fierce goddess for me in vain,</p>
<p>why throw yourself at me? You&#8217;ll have no thanks.</p>
<p>Choose, as you&#8217;ve wrought: don&#8217;t try to appease Diana.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t care about me: you can&#8217;t &#8211; she&#8217;s on your side.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather Delos, in Aegean waters, had never been known -</p>
<p>or at least had not been known then, to me.</p>
<p>Then my ship was launched in troubled waters,</p>
<p>and an unlucky hour saw my journey start.</p>
<p>Why did I take a step? Why did I cross the threshold?</p>
<p>Why did my feet touch the painted fabric of that swift vessel?</p>
<p>Yet twice the sails were backed, in an opposing wind:</p>
<p>I tell a lie, ah foolish! It was a favourable one.</p>
<p>It was favourable in reversing my departure</p>
<p>and hindering that scarcely fortunate journey.</p>
<p>And I wish the sails had been always set against me!</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s stupid to complain about the fickleness of the breeze.</p>
<p>I hurried to see Delos, stirred by the fame of the place,</p>
<p>and the journey seemed to be made in an idle boat.</p>
<p>How often I protested at the slowness of the oars,</p>
<p>and complained that too little sail was set for the wind.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;d already passed Andros, Tenos and Myconos,</p>
<p>and bright Delos was there before my eyes:</p>
<p>when I saw it in the distance, I said: &#8216;Island, why do you flee me,</p>
<p>do you wander, as long ago, on the mighty waters?&#8217;</p>
<p>I stood on the island, as day was nearly done,</p>
<p>and the sun desires to unyoke his bright horses.</p>
<p>When as usual that same sun returned to the east,</p>
<p>my mother arranged my hair as prescribed.</p>
<p>She put rings on my fingers, gold in my hair,</p>
<p>and herself placed the robes on my shoulders.</p>
<p>We went straight to the gods to whom the isle is sacred,</p>
<p>making offerings of golden incense and wine:</p>
<p>and, while my mother drenched the altar in sacrificial blood,</p>
<p>and threw the divided entrails on the smoking fires,</p>
<p>my diligent nurse led me to the high temple also,</p>
<p>and we wandered with errant feet through the holy place:</p>
<p>and now I walk in the colonnades, and now wonder</p>
<p>at the regal gifts and statues set up everywhere.</p>
<p>I marvel at the altar made of countless horns,</p>
<p>and the tree near to which the goddess in labour gave birth,</p>
<p>and whatever else Delos displays &#8211; and I can&#8217;t remember,</p>
<p>and I&#8217;m unable to speak of, all I saw there.</p>
<p>Perhaps as I gazed at this, I was gazed at by you, Acontius,</p>
<p>and my innocence was seen to be capable of capture.</p>
<p>I turn back into the temple by its high flight of steps -</p>
<p>can any place be safer than this?</p>
<p>An apple was thrown at my feet with this verse on it -</p>
<p>ah me! Now too I almost swore that oath to you!</p>
<p>My nurse bent down and, marvelling, said: &#8216;Read this&#8217;.</p>
<p>I read your deceitful lines, mighty poet.</p>
<p>Reading the word &#8216;marriage&#8217; I blushed with shame,</p>
<p>I felt the whole of both cheeks had reddened,</p>
<p>and I held my gaze on my lap as it if were fixed there.</p>
<p>Cruel man, why do you rejoice: what glory is there for you?</p>
<p>And why should you have praise, a man cheating a virgin girl?</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t stand there armed with shield and axe,</p>
<p>as Penthesilea was armed on Trojan soil:</p>
<p>nor were you given the prize of an embossed girdle,</p>
<p>of Amazon gold, like Hippolyte&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Why exult in your words if they deceived me,</p>
<p>I a girl, taken in, scarcely aware of trickery?</p>
<p>An apple caught Cydippe, an apple Atalanta:</p>
<p>surely now you&#8217;re a second Hippomenes?</p>
<p>But it would have been better, if the Boy held you,</p>
<p>whom you say has all those torches, to behave</p>
<p>in the way good men do, not to ruin hope by fraud:</p>
<p>better if winning by entreaty had been yours, and not snatching.</p>
<p>Why, when you sought me, did you think it unnecessary</p>
<p>to declare what required you to be sought by me too?</p>
<p>Why did you wish to use force, rather than persuasion,</p>
<p>if I was able to be trapped by only hearing the word marriage?</p>
<p>Why is the law of use to you now, my needing to swear by rote,</p>
<p>my tongue needing to call the goddess in person to vouch for it?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the mind that swears the oath. I swore nothing to her:</p>
<p>she alone can impart truth to what&#8217;s been said.</p>
<p>Intention, and the mind&#8217;s thoughtful judgement, swear oaths,</p>
<p>and unless there&#8217;s judgement the contract has no value.</p>
<p>If you think I wished to promise you marriage,</p>
<p>then demand the rights of the promised bed by law.</p>
<p>But if I gave voice to nothing unless it was without thought,</p>
<p>you have only idle words bereft of power.</p>
<p>I did not swear, I read the words of an oath:</p>
<p>my husband is not to be chosen that way.</p>
<p>Deceive others so, let your letters follow apples:</p>
<p>if it&#8217;s valid, carry away the riches of the wealthy:</p>
<p>make kings swear they&#8217;ll give their kingdoms to you,</p>
<p>and let whatever on earth pleases you be yours!</p>
<p>Believe me, this is far superior to Diana herself,</p>
<p>if your writing really has such ready power.</p>
<p>Yet though I&#8217;ve said all this, though I&#8217;ve firmly rejected you,</p>
<p>though the reason for my promise has been fully rehearsed.</p>
<p>I confess, I&#8217;m afraid of the anger of Leto&#8217;s fierce daughter,</p>
<p>and I suspect my body&#8217;s troubled because of her.</p>
<p>Why, whenever the ceremonies of marriage are being prepared,</p>
<p>do the weary limbs of the destined bride give way?</p>
<p>Three times now Hymen, coming to the altars raised for me,</p>
<p>has fled, and turned his back on the wedding threshold,</p>
<p>and the slowly flickering light in his hand is barely rising,</p>
<p>his torch is barely alight with quivering flame.</p>
<p>Often perfumes have dripped from his garlanded hair,</p>
<p>and his dragging robe has been bright with saffron.</p>
<p>When he reaches the threshold, and finds tears and terror of death,</p>
<p>and everything alien to his customs,</p>
<p>he throws away the wreathes, tearing them from his brow,</p>
<p>and wipes the thick spices from his shining hair:</p>
<p>and he&#8217;s ashamed to stand there, joyful, among the mournful crowd,</p>
<p>and the yellow of his robe transfers to his blushing cheeks.</p>
<p>But I, alas, am so wretched! My body burns with fever,</p>
<p>and the ordinary sheets on my bed feel heavier.</p>
<p>I see my weeping parents, by my head,</p>
<p>and the funeral torch, not the wedding torch, is here.</p>
<p>Spare my suffering, goddess, who delights in the ornate quiver,</p>
<p>and grant me now your brother&#8217;s healing aid.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s shameful to you, if he averts the cause of death,</p>
<p>while you bear the responsibility for my dying.</p>
<p>Is it that you may have wanted to bathe in a shaded pool,</p>
<p>and my face, unaware, came upon you bathing?</p>
<p>Have I neglected your altars, of all the deities: is it that</p>
<p>my mother&#8217;s ancestress, Niobe, scorned your mother, Leto?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not sinned at all, except that I read a false oath aloud,</p>
<p>and was fluent in a verse that brought me little luck.</p>
<p>You, too, Acontius, if you&#8217;re not lying about your love,</p>
<p>bring incense: let the hands, that harmed me, help me!</p>
<p>Why, if you&#8217;re angry that the girl sworn to you is not yet yours,</p>
<p>do you act in such a way that she can never be yours?</p>
<p>All your hopes depend on my living: why should the cruel goddess</p>
<p>take away my life from me, your hope of me from you?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think that he, who&#8217;s intended for my husband,</p>
<p>fondles my fevered limbs, placing his hands there.</p>
<p>Rather he sits here, as long as he&#8217;s allowed to:</p>
<p>but he remembers that mine is a virgin bed.</p>
<p>Now too something of what he has felt appears:</p>
<p>now often tears fall from some hidden cause,</p>
<p>and he praises me less boldly and gives me fewer kisses,</p>
<p>and calls me his with a humble expression.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not surprised he felt that: I&#8217;m betrayed by obvious signs:</p>
<p>I turn on my right side, un-speaking, when he comes,</p>
<p>and pretend to be asleep with eyes closed,</p>
<p>and, catching his hand when he touches me, I push it away.</p>
<p>He groans, and sighs secretly from his heart, and has</p>
<p>me as a cause of offence, though it&#8217;s undeserved.</p>
<p>Ah me, how you delight in me, how this wish of yours gives you joy!</p>
<p>Ah me, how I feel I&#8217;ve revealed my feelings to you!</p>
<p>You were worthy of me if anyone was, you, more justly</p>
<p>an object of indignation, who spread the nets for me.</p>
<p>You write that you&#8217;d like to see this wasted body:</p>
<p>you&#8217;re far from me, and you might still harm me by it.</p>
<p>I wondered why your name was &#8216;Acontius&#8217;:</p>
<p>that blade which wounds from far off, has &#8216;acuteness&#8217;.</p>
<p>Certainly I&#8217;ve not recovered from that wound,</p>
<p>that spear of your letter hurled from a distance.</p>
<p>Why would you still come here? You&#8217;d see a body</p>
<p>in ill health, a glorious prize for your skills!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m enfeebled by emaciation: my colour is bloodless,</p>
<p>just like your apple was, I recall to mind.</p>
<p>My face shines white, unmixed with red.</p>
<p>a statue of fresh marble looks like this:</p>
<p>the silver set out on the table is the same,</p>
<p>pale, touched by the chill of iced water.</p>
<p>If you saw me now, you&#8217;d deny you&#8217;d seen me before:</p>
<p>you&#8217;d say: &#8216;This was not what my cunning sought.&#8217;</p>
<p>And you&#8217;d return my pledge of faith, lest I be joined to you,</p>
<p>and wish the goddess had forgotten it.</p>
<p>Perhaps indeed you might make me swear a contrary oath,</p>
<p>and you might send me other words to read.</p>
<p>But I still wish you might see me, as you yourself asked,</p>
<p>and see your promised bride&#8217;s weakened limbs!</p>
<p>Even if your heart were harder than iron, Acontius,</p>
<p>you would indeed seek to forgive my words.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t ignore me: I seek from the god of Delphi, who foretells</p>
<p>our fate, the aid through which I could be made well again.</p>
<p>Also someone complains, now that vague rumour whispers it,</p>
<p>that the witnessed promise has been neglected.</p>
<p>This the god, this his seer, this his oracle declare:</p>
<p>ah, no power is lacking to support your wishes!</p>
<p>How have you found such favour? Unless perhaps a new choice text</p>
<p>has been discovered, that harnesses the great gods.</p>
<p>And I follow the will of the gods, gods you are master of,</p>
<p>and willingly give my captive hands to your wishes:</p>
<p>and full of shame, with my eyes fixed on the ground,</p>
<p>I told my mother of the promise my deceived tongue made.</p>
<p>The rest is your concern, and more than a virgin should do:</p>
<p>with you I&#8217;m not afraid of what my letter declares.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve wearied my sick body with this pen:</p>
<p>and my hand denies further service, in my illness.</p>
<p>Nothing remains, since I now desire to join myself with you,</p>
<p>except for me to add, to my letter, this: &#8216;Farewell!&#8217;</p>
