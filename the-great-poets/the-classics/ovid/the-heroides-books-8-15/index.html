				<p>VIII: Hermione to Orestes</p>
<p>Hermione speaks to one lately her cousin and husband,</p>
<p>now her cousin. The wife has changed her name.</p>
<p>Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, proud, in his father&#8217;s image,</p>
<p>holds me imprisoned contrary to piety and justice.</p>
<p>I have refused what I could, so as not be held against my will,</p>
<p>a woman&#8217;s hand has not the power to do more.</p>
<p>&#8216;Scion of Aeacus, what are you doing? I&#8217;m not without a champion&#8217;</p>
<p>I said, &#8216;to you, Pyrrhus, this girl is under his command!&#8217;</p>
<p>Deafer than the sea, he dragged me under his roof,</p>
<p>my hair unbound, and I calling on Orestes&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>How could I have endured worse, as a slave in a captured Sparta,</p>
<p>if a barbarian horde were to seize a daughter of Greece?</p>
<p>Andromache was less abused by victorious Achaia,</p>
<p>when Greek flames might have burnt the wealth of Troy.</p>
<p>But you, Orestes, if my affectionate care for you moves you,</p>
<p>take possession of me, without cowardice, as is your right!</p>
<p>You&#8217;d surely take up arms if someone snatched your cattle</p>
<p>from the closed stable, will you be slower for a captive wife?</p>
<p>Let you father-in-law, Menelaus, be your example in reclaiming</p>
<p>a lost wife, a girl who was the cause of a just war:</p>
<p>if my father had wept in his empty palace like a coward,</p>
<p>my mother would be married to Paris as before.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t ready a thousand ships with swelling canvas</p>
<p>or hosts of Greek warriors: come yourself!</p>
<p>Yet if I too were won back in this way, it&#8217;s no shame for a husband to have endured fierce war for his dear marriage bed.</p>
<p>Why, since Atreus, Pelop&#8217;s son, is our mutual grandfather,</p>
<p>even if you weren&#8217;t my husband, you&#8217;d still be my cousin.</p>
<p>Husband, I beg you, aid your wife, cousin aid your cousin:</p>
<p>both titles urge you to perform your duty.</p>
<p>Tyndareus gave me to you, he, my ancestor, heavy with experience,</p>
<p>and years: the grandfather decided for the grand-child.</p>
<p>But Menelaus, my father, made a promise of me, unaware of this act:</p>
<p>yet a grandfather has more power than a father, being first in rank.</p>
<p>When I married you, my wedding harmed no one:</p>
<p>if I unite with Pyrrhus, you&#8217;ll be hurt by me.</p>
<p>And my father, Menelaus, may know nothing of our love:</p>
<p>he himself succumbed to the arrows of the swift-winged god.</p>
<p>The love he allowed himself, he should pardon in a son-in-law.</p>
<p>My mother appears as an example to him.</p>
<p>You are to me as my father was to Helen, my mother. The part</p>
<p>that Paris, a Trojan stranger, once played, Pyrrhus performs.</p>
<p>He may boast endlessly about his father&#8217;s, Achilles&#8217;s, deeds,</p>
<p>you also have your father&#8217;s actions to speak about.</p>
<p>Agamemnon, Tantalus&#8217;s scion, ruled over all, even Achilles:</p>
<p>the latter a soldier, the former was lord of lords.</p>
<p>You too have Pelops and his father, Tantalus, as ancestors:</p>
<p>if you counted carefully, you&#8217;d be the fifth from Jove.</p>
<p>Nor do you lack worth. You bore the weapons of hate:</p>
<p>but why might you have done so? Your father&#8217;s fate endowed you.</p>
<p>I wish you might have had better reasons for courage:</p>
<p>the work was not of your choosing, the cause was forced on you.</p>
<p>You still fulfilled your duty: Aegisthus, from his open throat,</p>
<p>stained the house with blood, as your father had before.</p>
<p>Pyrrhus, scion of Aeacus, speaks against you, turns praise</p>
<p>to blame, and still maintains it to my face.</p>
<p>I am violated, and my face swells with feeling,</p>
<p>and my inflamed emotions grieve me with hidden fires.</p>
<p>Who has not taunted Orestes in Hermione&#8217;s presence:</p>
<p>I have no power, there&#8217;s no cruel sword here!</p>
<p>Truly I can weep: I diffuse anger in weeping,</p>
<p>and tears flow like streams over my breast.</p>
<p>I have only these, always, and always I pour them out:</p>
<p>they wet my neglected cheeks, from a perennial fountain.</p>
<p>Surely, by the fate of my race, that tracks us through the years,</p>
<p>the mothers of Tantalus&#8217;s line are suited to be prey?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll not repeat the lies of the swan of the river to Leda,</p>
<p>or complain of Jupiter hiding under its plumage.</p>
<p>Far off where the long Isthmus divides two seas,</p>
<p>Hippodamia was carried of by the stranger&#8217;s, Pelops&#8217;s, chariot.</p>
<p>Two sisters, Phoebe and Hilaeira, were brought back to the city</p>
<p>of Taenarus, from Messene, by Castor and Pollux, of Amyclae.</p>
<p>Helen was taken from Taenarus, across the sea to Ida, by a stranger, Paris, on account of whom the Greeks turned to their weapons.</p>
<p>Of course I can scarcely remember it. Yet I remember:</p>
<p>everyone grieving, everyone full of anxious fears.</p>
<p>Grandfather cried, and aunt Phoebe, and the Twins,</p>
<p>Leda prayed to the heavens and her Jupiter.</p>
<p>Even then I cut my hair that was not yet long</p>
<p>calling: &#8216;Without me, mother, why do you go without me?&#8217;</p>
<p>Now a husband will leave. Lest I may be thought not Pelops&#8217;s scion, see I was prepared as a prize for Pyrrhus, this Neoptolemus.</p>
<p>I wish Apollo&#8217;s bow had avoided Achilles, son of Peleus!</p>
<p>The father would condemn the son for his violent deed.</p>
<p>A bereaved husband crying for his abducted bride</p>
<p>didn&#8217;t please Achilles then, nor would it have pleased him now.</p>
<p>Why do the hostile heavens cause me injury?</p>
<p>Why must I complain that a troubled destiny harms me?</p>
<p>My childhood was motherless: father was at the war:</p>
<p>and while both lived, I was bereaved of both.</p>
<p>Not for you, my mother, the charming lispings of those tender years,</p>
<p>spoken by your daughter&#8217;s uncertain mouth.</p>
<p>I did not clasp your neck with tiny arms,</p>
<p>or sit, a welcome burden, on your lap.</p>
<p>You didn&#8217;t tend my dress, nor on my marriage</p>
<p>did I enter a new marriage bed, prepared by my mother.</p>
<p>When you returned I came out to meet you &#8211; I confess the truth -</p>
<p>my mother&#8217;s face was not familiar!</p>
<p>Yet I knew you were Helen, as you were the most beautiful:</p>
<p>you yourself asked which child was your daughter.</p>
<p>This alone is mine: that Orestes is happily my husband:</p>
<p>he too will be taken from me, if he doesn&#8217;t fight for his own.</p>
<p>Pyrrhus has a prisoner, though my father returns victorious:</p>
<p>and this is the gift to me from Troy&#8217;s destruction!</p>
<p>When the Sun with his radiant horses holds the heights,</p>
<p>I still enjoy, unhappily, my little freedom:</p>
<p>when night shuts me in my room, with crying and bitter groans,</p>
<p>and I sink down on my sorrowful bed,</p>
<p>tears instead of sleep are made to spring up in my eyes</p>
<p>and I shrink from my husband as if from an enemy.</p>
<p>Often I&#8217;m stupefied by my ills and forgetful of things,</p>
<p>and where I am, and, unaware, I touch a limb from Scyros:</p>
<p>and I feel the wrong, and draw away from the body I touched,</p>
<p>in error, and I think my very hand to be polluted.</p>
<p>Often Orestes&#8217;s name escapes me rather than Neoptolemus,</p>
<p>and I love the error in my speech as if it were an omen.</p>
<p>I swear by my unhappy tribe and Jove, the father of that tribe,</p>
<p>who shakes the seas and lands and his own realm:</p>
<p>by your father&#8217;s, my uncle&#8217;s, bones, who requires of you</p>
<p>that he might lie beneath his mound bravely avenged:</p>
<p>that either I shall die early, and be lost in my first youth,</p>
<p>or I, descendant of Tantalus, shall be wife to his descendant.</p>
<p>IX: Deianira to Hercules
</p>
<p>A letter, that shares her feelings, sent to Alcides</p>
<p>by your wife, if Deianira is your wife.</p>
<p>I give thanks that Oechalia is added to our titles,</p>
<p>I lament that the victor succumbs to his victory.</p>
<p>A sudden rumour spreads through the Pelasgian cities</p>
<p>tarnishing, and denying, your deeds:</p>
<p>you, whom neither Juno nor her succession of mighty labours</p>
<p>could crush: Iole has placed the yoke on you.</p>
<p>King Eurystheus would enjoy this, the Thunderer&#8217;s sister too,</p>
<p>that stepmother delighting in the blemish to your career.</p>
<p>But Jupiter would not, for whom (if it&#8217;s to be believed)</p>
<p>one night was not sufficient to father so great a child.</p>
<p>Venus has harmed you more than Juno: the latter, burdened you,</p>
<p>and raised you up, the former holds your neck beneath her foot.</p>
<p>Behold, a world pacified by your protective strength,</p>
<p>where sea-green Nereus circles the wide earth.</p>
<p>The lands owe their peace to you, the oceans their safety:</p>
<p>your merits fill the sun&#8217;s two horizons.</p>
<p>The sky where you will live, you once bore:</p>
<p>Hercules, replacing Atlas, held up the stars.</p>
<p>What will you have gained except notoriety for your sad disgrace</p>
<p>if you add a known unchastity to your former deeds?</p>
<p>Do you insist on what is said, that, in your tender cradle,</p>
<p>you squeezed two snakes tightly, and were once worthy of Jove?</p>
<p>You started better than you finish: the end&#8217;s inferior</p>
<p>to the beginning: this man differs from that child.</p>
<p>What a thousand wild beasts, Sthenelus your enemy,</p>
<p>and Juno, could not conquer, Love has conquered.</p>
<p>But they say I married well, since I&#8217;m called Hercules&#8217;s wife,</p>
<p>and my father-in-law is he who thunders through the heights.</p>
<p>The ox that comes to the plough unequally yoked</p>
<p>is weighed down like the lesser wife of a greater husband.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a burden not an honour to endure a flawed splendour,</p>
<p>if you wish to be well married, marry an equal.</p>
<p>My husband&#8217;s always away, more like a guest than a husband,</p>
<p>and he chases after vile monsters and wild beasts.</p>
<p>I, occupied with my chaste prayers in this empty house,</p>
<p>torment myself that he&#8217;s downed by some aggressive enemy:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m troubled by serpents, wild boars, hungry lions,</p>
<p>and hounds that cling to him with their triple jaws.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m worried by sacrificial entrails, vain dream phantoms,</p>
<p>and secret omens searched for in the night.</p>
<p>Unhappy, I try to catch the murmurings of uncertain rumour:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m made fearful by wavering hope, and hope is killed by fear.</p>
<p>Your mother Alcmena is absent, and grieves that she pleased the god,</p>
<p>neither your father Amphitryon nor your son Hyllus are here.</p>
<p>I suffer Eurystheus, your judge through the cunning of unjust Juno,</p>
<p>and I suffer the endless anger of the goddess.</p>
<p>That is enough to bear: but you add foreign lovers,</p>
<p>and whichever girl wishes to can become a mother by you.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t mention Auge, violated in the valleys of Parthenius,</p>
<p>or your child Tlepolemus by the nymph Astydameia:</p>
<p>it wasn&#8217;t your fault, that crowd of Thespius&#8217;s daughters,</p>
<p>of whose company not one was left alone by you.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one recent sin, reported to me, Omphale, the adulteress,</p>
<p>by whom I&#8217;m made a stepmother to your Lydian Lamus.</p>
<p>Maeander, which wanders about so greatly through that same land,</p>
<p>often returning his weary waters back on themselves,</p>
<p>saw a necklace hanging from Hercules&#8217;s neck,</p>
<p>that neck to which the heavens were a small burden.</p>
<p>Weren&#8217;t you ashamed, your strong arms circled with gold,</p>
<p>and jewels placed on your bulging muscles?</p>
<p>Surely the breath of the Nemean lion was expelled by those arms,</p>
<p>that pestilential beast whose skin you wear on your left shoulder.</p>
<p>You dare to crown your long hair with a turban!</p>
<p>White poplar leaves are more fitting for Hercules.</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t you ashamed at having been reduced to circling your waist</p>
<p>with a Maeonian belt like an impudent girl?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you recall the memory of cruel Diomede,</p>
<p>that savage who fed his horses on human flesh?</p>
<p>If Busiris had seen you dressed like this, surely he&#8217;d have been ashamed to be have been conquered by such a conqueror!</p>
<p>Antaeus would tear the bands from your strong neck,</p>
<p>lest he regret surrendering to such a weakling!</p>
<p>They say you held a basket among the Ionian girls</p>
<p>and were frightened by your mistress&#8217;s threats.</p>
<p>Did your hand not draw back, assigned its smooth basket,</p>
<p>Alcides, conqueror of a thousand labours,</p>
<p>and did you draw out the thread with your strong thumb,</p>
<p>and was an equally handsome weight of wool returned?</p>
<p>Ah! How often, while your rough fingers twisted the thread,</p>
<p>your over-heavy hand broke the spindle!</p>
<p>Of course you&#8217;ll have told of deeds, hiding that they were yours:</p>
<p>squeezing savage snakes by their throats,</p>
<p>entangling your infant hands in their coils:</p>
<p>how the Tegaean boar would lie in Erymanthian cypress woods</p>
<p>and damage the earth with his great weight:</p>
<p>you wouldn&#8217;t be silent about those heads hung on Thracian houses,</p>
<p>nor Diomede&#8217;s mares fattened on human bodies,</p>
<p>nor the triple monster, rich in Spanish cattle,</p>
<p>Geryon, who was three monsters in one:</p>
<p>and Cerberus the hound with as many bodies split from one,</p>
<p>his hair entangled by a threatening snake:</p>
<p>the fertile serpent born again from her fecund wound,</p>
<p>and she herself enriched by her losses.</p>
<p>and he who hung between your left arm and left side,</p>
<p>a weary weight as you crushed his throat,</p>
<p>and the Centaurs&#8217; battered troop on the heights of Thessaly,</p>
<p>trusting wrongly in their speed and dual form.</p>
<p>Can you speak of that, marked out by Sidonian dress?</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t your tongue fall silent curbed by your clothing?</p>
<p>Iole, the nymph, daughter of Iardanus, also wears your arms</p>
<p>and bears a familiar trophy from her captive hero.</p>
<p>Go on then, excite your courage and review your great deeds:</p>
<p>swear by that she&#8217;s the hero you should be.</p>
<p>By as much as you are the less, greatest of men, so much the greater her victory over you, than yours over those you conquered.</p>
<p>The measure of your goods goes to her, give up your wealth:</p>
<p>your mistress is the inheritor of your worth.</p>
<p>O shame! The rough pelt stripped from the ribs</p>
<p>of a bristling lion covers her tender flank!</p>
<p>You are wrong and don&#8217;t realise: her spoils aren&#8217;t from a lion,</p>
<p>but from you: you&#8217;re the creature&#8217;s conqueror, she&#8217;s yours.</p>
<p>A woman bears the black shaft with Lernean poison,</p>
<p>one scarcely fitted to carry the heavy distaff of wool,</p>
<p>and lifts in her hand the club that tamed wild beasts,</p>
<p>and gazes at my husband&#8217;s arms in her mirror.</p>
<p>Yet I still had only heard this: I could ignore the rumours,</p>
<p>and grief came to the senses gently on the breeze.</p>
<p>Now a foreign rival is brought before my eyes,</p>
<p>and I cannot hide from myself what I suffer!</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t let me avoid her: she walks like a captive</p>
<p>through the middle of the city to be seen by unwilling eyes.</p>
<p>But not with unbound hair in the manner of a captive:</p>
<p>she confesses her good fortune by her seemly looks,</p>
<p>walking, visible far and wide, covered with gold,</p>
<p>just as you yourself were dressed in Phrygia:</p>
<p>showing her proud face to the crowd like Hercules&#8217;s conqueror:</p>
<p>you&#8217;d think Oechalia still stood, with her father living:</p>
<p>and perhaps Aetolian Deianira will be beaten off,</p>
<p>and Iole will be your wife, dropping the label of mistress,</p>
<p>and wicked Hymen will join the shameful bodies</p>
<p>of Iole, Eurytus&#8217;s daughter and Aonian Hercules.</p>
<p>My mind shuns the idea, and a chill runs through my body,</p>
<p>and my listless hand lies here in my lap.</p>
<p>You have loved me too among others, but without sin:</p>
<p>don&#8217;t regret I was twice a reason for you to fight.</p>
<p>Achelous, weeping, lifted his broken horn from the wet bank,</p>
<p>and immersed his maimed head in the muddy waters:</p>
<p>Nessus the Centaur sank into the fatal Evenus,</p>
<p>and discoloured its waves with his equine blood.</p>
<p>But why do I recall this? Written news comes,</p>
<p>rumour that my husband&#8217;s dying from the poison in his tunic.</p>
<p>Ah me! What have I done? What madness has my love caused?</p>
<p>Impious Deianira, why do you hesitate to die?</p>
<p>Or shall your husband tear himself apart on Mount Oeta,</p>
<p>and you, the cause of so much wickedness, survive?</p>
<p>If I have had reasons till now why I should be thought</p>
<p>Hercules&#8217;s wife, let my death be a pledge of our union.</p>
<p>You will recognise a sister of yours in me too, Meleager!</p>
<p>Impious Deianira, why do you hesitate to die?</p>
<p>Alas for my accursed house! Agrius sits on Calydon&#8217;s high throne:</p>
<p>defenceless old age weighs on forsaken Oeneus:</p>
<p>Tydeus, my brother, is an exile on an unknown shore:</p>
<p>the other, Meleager, was burned by the fatal flame.</p>
<p>Althaea, our mother, pierced her breast with a blade.</p>
<p>Impious Deianira, why do you hesitate to die?</p>
<p>This one thing I plead, by the most sacred law of the marriage-bed,</p>
<p>lest I appear to have plotted for your death:</p>
<p>Nessus, when his covetous breast was struck by the arrow,</p>
<p>whispered: &#8216;This blood has power over love.&#8217;</p>
<p>Oh, I sent you the fabric smeared with Nessus&#8217;s poison.</p>
<p>Impious Deianira, why do you hesitate to die?</p>
<p>Now farewell my aged father, and you, my sister Gorge,</p>
<p>and my land, and my brother wrenched from that land,</p>
<p>and you the last day&#8217;s light to meet my eyes: and my husband -</p>
<p>but O can he still be &#8211; and Hyllus my son, farewell!</p>
<p>X: Ariadne to Theseus
</p>
<p>Even now, left to the wild beasts, she might live, cruel Theseus.</p>
<p>Do you expect her to have endured this too, patiently?</p>
<p>The whole tribe of creatures contrive to be gentler than you:</p>
<p>not one have I had less confidence in than you.</p>
<p>Theseus, what you read has been sent to you from this land,</p>
<p>from which your sails carried your ship without me,</p>
<p>in which my sleep, and you, evilly betrayed me,</p>
<p>conceiving your plans against me while I slept.</p>
<p>It was the time when the earth&#8217;s first sprinkled with glassy frost,</p>
<p>and the hidden birds lament in the leaves:</p>
<p>waking uncertainly, and stirring languidly in sleep,</p>
<p>half-turning, my hand reached out for Theseus:</p>
<p>there was no one there. I drew back, and tried again,</p>
<p>and moved my arm across the bed: no one there.</p>
<p>Fear broke through my drowsiness: terrified, I rose</p>
<p>and hurled my body from the empty bed.</p>
<p>Straight away my hands drummed on my breast, and tore at my hair, just as it was, on waking, from my confused sleep.</p>
<p>There was a moon: I looked and saw nothing but the shore:</p>
<p>wherever my eyes could see, there was nothing but sand.</p>
<p>I ran here and there without any sense of purpose,</p>
<p>the deep sand slowing a girl&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I called: &#8216;Theseus!&#8217; over the whole beach</p>
<p>your name echoing from the hollow cliffs</p>
<p>and as often as I called you, the place itself called too:</p>
<p>the place itself wished to give aid to my misery.</p>
<p>There was a hill: a few bushes were visible on its summit:</p>
<p>a crag hangs there hollowed out by the harsh waves.</p>
<p>I climbed it: courage gave me strength: and I scanned</p>
<p>the wide waters from that height with my gaze.</p>
<p>Then I saw &#8211; now the cruel winds were also felt -</p>
<p>your ship driven before a fierce southerly gale.</p>
<p>Either with what I saw, or what I may have thought I&#8217;d seen:</p>
<p>I was frozen like ice and half-alive.</p>
<p>But grief allowed no time for languor. I was roused by it,</p>
<p>and roused, I called to Theseus at the top of my voice.</p>
<p>&#8216;Where are you going?&#8217; I shouted &#8216;turn back, wicked Theseus!</p>
<p>Work your ship! You&#8217;re without one of your number!&#8217;</p>
<p>So I called. When my voice failed I beat my breast instead:</p>
<p>my blows were interspaced with my words.</p>
<p>If you could not hear at least you might still see:</p>
<p>I made wide signals with my outstretched hands.</p>
<p>I hung a white cloth on a tall branch,</p>
<p>hoping those who&#8217;d forgotten would remember me.</p>
<p>Now you were lost to sight. Then finally I wept:</p>
<p>till then my cheeks were numb with grief.</p>
<p>What could my eyes do but weep at myself,</p>
<p>once they had ceased to see your sails?</p>
<p>Either I wandered alone, with dishevelled hair,</p>
<p>like a Maenad shaken by the Theban god:</p>
<p>or I sat on the cold rock gazing at the sea,</p>
<p>and I was as much a stone as the stones I sat on.</p>
<p>Often I seek again the bed that accepted us both,</p>
<p>but it shows no sign of that acceptance,</p>
<p>and I touch what I can of the traces of you, instead of you,</p>
<p>and the sheets your body warmed.</p>
<p>I lie there and, wetting the bed with my flowing tears,</p>
<p>I cry out: &#8216;We two burdened you, restore the two!</p>
<p>We came here together: why shouldn&#8217;t we go together?</p>
<p>Faithless bed, where&#8217;s the better part of me now?</p>
<p>What am I to do? Why endure alone? The island&#8217;s unploughed:</p>
<p>I see no human beings: I can&#8217;t imagine there&#8217;s an ox.</p>
<p>The land&#8217;s encircled by the sea on every side: no sailors,</p>
<p>no ship to set sail on its uncertain way.</p>
<p>Suppose I was given companions, winds and ship,</p>
<p>where would I make for? My country denies me access.</p>
<p>If my boat slid gently through peaceful waters,</p>
<p>calmed by Aeolian winds, I&#8217;d be an exile still.</p>
<p>I could not gaze at you, Crete, split in a hundred cities,</p>
<p>a land that was known to the infant Jove.</p>
<p>But my father and that land justly ruled by my father,</p>
<p>those dear names, were both betrayed by me.</p>
<p>while you, the victor who retraced your steps, would have died</p>
<p>in the winding labyrinth, unless guided by the thread I gave you,</p>
<p>Then, you said to me: &#8216;I swear by the dangers overcome,</p>
<p>that you&#8217;ll be mine while we both shall live.&#8217;</p>
<p>We live, and I&#8217;m not yours, Theseus, if you still live,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a woman buried by the fraud of a lying man.</p>
<p>Club that killed my brother, the Minotaur, condemn me too!</p>
<p>The promise that you gave should be dissolved by death.</p>
<p>Now I see not only what I must endure,</p>
<p>but what any castaway would suffer.</p>
<p>A thousand images of dying fill my mind,</p>
<p>and I fear death less than delay in that penalty of death.</p>
<p>At every moment I dream it, coming from here or there,</p>
<p>as if wolves tore my entrails with eager teeth.</p>
<p>Perhaps this land breeds tawny lions?</p>
<p>Who knows if this island harbours savage tigers?</p>
<p>And they say that the ocean throws up huge sea-lions:</p>
<p>and who could prevent some sword piercing my side?</p>
<p>If only I might not be a captive, bound with harsh chains,</p>
<p>nor draw out endless threads with a slave&#8217;s hand,</p>
<p>I whose father is Minos, whose mother is the Sun&#8217;s daughter,</p>
<p>because of that I remember the more, that I was bound to you!</p>
<p>If I see the ocean, the land and the wide shore,</p>
<p>I fear many things on land, many on the waves.</p>
<p>The sky remains: I fear visions from the gods:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m forsaken, a prey and food for swift beasts.</p>
<p>If men live here and cultivate this place, I distrust them:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thoroughly learned to fear wounds from strangers.</p>
<p>I wish my brother Androgeos lived and you Athens, land of Cecrops,</p>
<p>hadn&#8217;t payed with your childrens&#8217; deaths for his impious murder:</p>
<p>and that you, Theseus hadn&#8217;t killed the Minotaur, half man, half bull,</p>
<p>wielding a knotted club in your strong hand:</p>
<p>and that I hadn&#8217;t given you the thread that marked your way back,</p>
<p>the thread so often received back inot the hand that drew it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not surprised that victory was yours, and the monster,</p>
<p>prone, lay groaning on the Cretan earth.</p>
<p>His horns could not pierce your iron heart:</p>
<p>though you might fail to shield it, your breast would be safe.</p>
<p>There you revealed flints and adamants,</p>
<p>there you&#8217;ve a Theseus harder than flint.</p>
<p>Cruel sleep, why did you hold me there, senseless?</p>
<p>Rather I should have been buried forever in eternal night.</p>
<p>You too cruel winds, you gales, all too ready</p>
<p>and officious in bringing tears to me:</p>
<p>cruel right hand that causes my death, and my brother&#8217;s,</p>
<p>and offered the promise I asked, an empty name:</p>
<p>Sleep, the breeze, the promise conspired against me:</p>
<p>one girl, I&#8217;m betrayed by three causes.</p>
<p>So it seems I&#8217;ll die without seeing my mother&#8217;s tears,</p>
<p>and there&#8217;ll be no one to close my eyes.</p>
<p>My unhappy spirit will vanish on a foreign breeze,</p>
<p>no friendly hand will anoint my laid-out body.</p>
<p>The seabirds will hover over my unburied bones:</p>
<p>these are the ceremonies fit for my tomb.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be carried to Athens, and be received by your homeland,</p>
<p>where you&#8217;ll stand in the high fortress of your city,</p>
<p>and speak cleverly of the death of man and bull,</p>
<p>and the labyrinth&#8217;s winding paths cut from the rock:</p>
<p>speak of me also, abandoned in a lonely land:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not to be dropped, secretly, from your list!</p>
<p>Your father&#8217;s not Aegeus: Aethra, daughter of Pittheus,</p>
<p>is not your mother: your creators were stone and sea.</p>
<p>May the gods have ordained that you saw me from the high stern,</p>
<p>that my mournful figure altered your expression.</p>
<p>Now see me not with your eyes, but as you can, with your mind,</p>
<p>clinging to a rock the fickle sea beats against:</p>
<p>see my dishevelled hair like one who is in mourning</p>
<p>and my clothes heavy with tears like rain!</p>
<p>My body trembles like ears of wheat struck by a north wind</p>
<p>and the letters I write waver in my unsteady fingers.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t entreat you by my kindness, since that has ended badly:</p>
<p>let no gratitude be owed for my deeds.</p>
<p>But no punishment either. If I&#8217;m not the cause of your health,</p>
<p>that&#8217;s still no reason why you should cause me harm.</p>
<p>These hands weary of beating my sad breast for you,</p>
<p>unhappily I stretch them out over the wide waters:</p>
<p>I mournfully display to you what remains of my hair:</p>
<p>I beg you by these tears your actions have caused:</p>
<p>turn your ship, Theseus, fall back against the wind:</p>
<p>if I die first, you can still bear my bones.</p>
<p>XI: Canace to Macareus
</p>
<p>An Aeolid, who has no health herself, sends it to an Aeolid,</p>
<p>and, armed, these words are written by her hand.</p>
<p>If the script is full of errors, with its dark blots,</p>
<p>the letter will have been stained by a woman&#8217;s blood.</p>
<p>My right hand holds a pen, my left a naked sword</p>
<p>and the paper&#8217;s lying loosely in my lap.</p>
<p>This is the image of Aeolus&#8217;s daughter writing to her brother:</p>
<p>it seems in this way I can appease our harsh father.</p>
<p>I could only wish that he were here to see my death</p>
<p>and the eyes of its author contemplate the act</p>
<p>though he&#8217;s uncivilised, and more ferocious than his east wind,</p>
<p>he would gaze at my wounds with dry cheeks.</p>
<p>How can anything good come of living with savage winds,</p>
<p>that nature of his matches his subjects.</p>
<p>He governs south, and west winds, and Thracian northerlies,</p>
<p>and your wings, violent easterlies.</p>
<p>Alas he governs the winds! He cannot govern his swollen anger,</p>
<p>and his kingdom is smaller than his faults.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the use of my bandying my ancestor&#8217;s names about the sky,</p>
<p>that Jupiter can be mentioned among my relatives?</p>
<p>Is this blade, my funeral gift, any less dangerous</p>
<p>because I hold it, not yarn, in my woman&#8217;s hand?</p>
<p>O I wish, Macareus, the hour that made us one</p>
<p>had come later than the hour of my death!</p>
<p>Brother, why did you love me more than a brother should,</p>
<p>and why was I not merely what a sister should be, to you?</p>
<p>I also burnt with it, in a way I used to hear about,</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what god I felt in my loving heart.</p>
<p>The colour fled from my face, my slender body grew thin,</p>
<p>I took the least food, forced it into my mouth:</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t sleep easily, and the night was a year to me,</p>
<p>and, wounded by no pains, I gave out groans.</p>
<p>Nor could I give a reason for why I acted so,</p>
<p>nor knew what a lover was, but I was one.</p>
<p>My nurse was the first to sense it, with an old woman&#8217;s acuteness:</p>
<p>my nurse first said: &#8216;Canace, you&#8217;re in love!&#8217;</p>
<p>I blushed, and shame sent my eyes down to my lap:</p>
<p>that was enough of a confession, that silent signal.</p>
<p>Then the burden swelled in my sinful belly,</p>
<p>and the secret load weighed on my weak limbs.</p>
<p>What herbs, what remedies did my nurse not bring</p>
<p>and she applied them with her rash hand,</p>
<p>in order &#8211; I hid this one thing from you &#8211; to expel</p>
<p>the growing burden from my womb!</p>
<p>Ah! The child, too much alive, resisted the arts she tried,</p>
<p>and was safe from its secret enemy.</p>
<p>Now Phoebus&#8217;s most beautiful sister had risen nine times,</p>
<p>and the new Moon drove her light-bringing horses:</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what caused my sudden pains,</p>
<p>and I was a new soldier, raw to the part.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t lessen my cries. &#8216;Why betray your sin?&#8217;</p>
<p>my knowing nurse said covering my wailing mouth.</p>
<p>What can I do, in my misery? Pain forces me to groan,</p>
<p>but fear and my nurse and shame forbid it.</p>
<p>I contain my cries, take back the words that escape me,</p>
<p>and force myself to swallow the tears I&#8217;ve shed.</p>
<p>Death was before my eyes, and Lucina denied her help</p>
<p>and, if I died pregnant, death too would be a crime:</p>
<p>when bending over me, tearing open my tunic, parting my hair,</p>
<p>and pressing my breast to yours, you revived me,</p>
<p>and you said to me: &#8216;Live, sister, o dearest sister,</p>
<p>live so that two aren&#8217;t lost in one body. Let a fine hope</p>
<p>give you strength: now you&#8217;ll be your brother&#8217;s bride.</p>
<p>he through whom you&#8217;ll be a mother and a wife.</p>
<p>Though I was dead, believe me, I still revived at your words</p>
<p>and my burden was laid down, the crime of my womb.</p>
<p>Why do you give thanks? Aeolus sits mid-palace:</p>
<p>our crimes must be hidden from our father&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>My diligent nurse hides the child among fruits,</p>
<p>and grey olive branches, and light sacred ribbons,</p>
<p>and pretends she&#8217;s making a sacrifice, says words of prayer:</p>
<p>the people give worship, the father himself steps aside.</p>
<p>Now she was nearly at the door. A cry reached our father&#8217;s ears</p>
<p>and that betrayed signs of the child.</p>
<p>Aeolus snatched up my baby and revealed the false sacrifice.</p>
<p>The palace echoed to his furious voice.</p>
<p>As the sea trembles, when touched by a mild breeze,</p>
<p>as the ash twig shakes in a warm south wind,</p>
<p>so you might have seen my pale limbs quiver:</p>
<p>the bed was shaken by the body lying on it.</p>
<p>He forced his way in, and broadcast my shame by his shouts,</p>
<p>and scarcely kept his hands from my poor face.</p>
<p>I could do nothing but modestly pour out tears.</p>
<p>My tongue was frozen, numbed by icy fear.</p>
<p>And then he ordered that his little grand-child should be given</p>
<p>to the dogs and birds, abandoned in a lonely place.</p>
<p>The child began to scream with misery &#8211; could he have understood -</p>
<p>as though he could beseech his grandfather with his voice.</p>
<p>What do you think my feelings were, then, my brother,</p>
<p>(now you can collect your feelings yourself)</p>
<p>when my child was carried off by my enemy into the deep woods,</p>
<p>to be eaten by wolves from the mountains?</p>
<p>He left my room, then at last I beat my breasts</p>
<p>and proceeded to run my fingers through my hair.</p>
<p>Meanwhile one of father&#8217;s attendants came, with a mournful face, and his mouth uttered shameful words:</p>
<p>&#8216;Aeolus sends you this sword&#8217; &#8211; he delivered the sword -</p>
<p>&#8216;and orders you to know his wish from its purpose.&#8217;</p>
<p>I know, and will use the violent weapon bravely:</p>
<p>I will sheathe father&#8217;s gift in my breast.</p>
<p>Do you give me this gift for my marriage, father?</p>
<p>Father, will your daughter be rich in this dowry?</p>
<p>Hymen, betrayed, take your marriage torches far from here,</p>
<p>and flee this impious house with troubled feet!</p>
<p>Furies bear the black torches you bear, to me,</p>
<p>and from those fires light my funeral pyre!</p>
<p>My happy sisters wedded to a better fate:</p>
<p>be lost to me but still remember me!</p>
<p>What did the child commit, in so few hours of life?</p>
<p>Scarcely born, by what act could he harm his grandfather?</p>
<p>If he can have merited death, he merited consideration:</p>
<p>ah, poor thing, punished for what I committed!</p>
<p>Child, your mother&#8217;s grief, a prey to devouring beasts,</p>
<p>ah me, your day of birth tears you apart,</p>
<p>child, sad pledge of my less than auspicious love,</p>
<p>this is your first day, this has been your last.</p>
<p>I could not let my rightful tears drench you,</p>
<p>nor cut a wisp of your hair to bear to the tomb:</p>
<p>I could not bend over you, and snatch an icy kiss:</p>
<p>ravenous wild beasts tear apart my baby.</p>
<p>I too, wounded, will follow the shade of my child:</p>
<p>I will not be called &#8216;mother&#8217; or &#8216;bereaved&#8217; for long.</p>
<p>Yet you, vain hope of your unhappy sister,</p>
<p>gather I beg you the scattered limbs of your son,</p>
<p>and bring them to their mother, place us in a shared tomb,</p>
<p>and let the narrow urn have whatever there is of us both!</p>
<p>Live on, remember us, and weep tears over my wound:</p>
<p>lover, do not shun the body of your lover.</p>
<p>You, I beg, obey the requests of the sister you loved too well!</p>
<p>I myself will obey our father&#8217;s order.</p>
<p>XII: Medea to Jason 
</p>
<p>Scorned Medea, the helpless exile, speaks to her recent husband,</p>
<p>surely you can spare some time from your kingship?</p>
<p>Oh, as I remember, the Queen of Colchis found time</p>
<p>to bring you riches, when you sought my arts!</p>
<p>Then, the Sisters who spin mortality&#8217;s threads,</p>
<p>should have unwound mine from the spindle:</p>
<p>Then you might have died well, Medea! Whatever</p>
<p>life&#8217;s brought since that time&#8217;s been punishment.</p>
<p>Ah me! Why was that Pelian ship driven forward</p>
<p>by youthful arms, seeking the ram of Phrixus?</p>
<p>Why did we of Colchis ever see the Thessalian Argo,</p>
<p>and your Greek crew drink the waters of Phasis?</p>
<p>Why did I take more pleasure than I should in your golden hair,</p>
<p>and your comeliness, and the lying favours of your tongue?</p>
<p>If not, once your strange ship had beached on our sands,</p>
<p>and had brought your brave warriors here,</p>
<p>Aeson&#8217;s son might have gone unmindful, unprotected by charms,</p>
<p>into the fiery breath, and burning muzzles, of the bulls!</p>
<p>He might have scattered the seed, and sown as many enemies,</p>
<p>so that the one who sowed fell prey to his own sowing!</p>
<p>What great treachery would have died with you, wicked man!</p>
<p>What great evils would have been averted from my head!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some kind of delight in reproaching your ingratitude</p>
<p>for my kindness: I&#8217;ll enjoy the only pleasure I&#8217;ll have from you.</p>
<p>Ordered to turn your untried ship towards Colchis,</p>
<p>you entered the lovely kingdom of my native land.</p>
<p>Medea was, there, what your new bride is here:</p>
<p>as rich as her father is, my father was as rich.</p>
<p>Her father holds Corinth, between two seas, mine all</p>
<p>that lies to the left of Pontus, as far as the Scythian snows.</p>
<p>Aeetes welcomes the young Greek heroes as guests,</p>
<p>and Pelasgian bodies grace the ornate beds.</p>
<p>Then I saw you: then I began to know what you might be:</p>
<p>that was the first ruin of my affections.</p>
<p>I saw and I perished! I burnt, not with familiar fires,</p>
<p>but as a pine torch might burn before the great gods.</p>
<p>And you were handsome, and my fate lured me on:</p>
<p>the light of your eyes stole mine away.</p>
<p>You sensed it, faithless one! For who can, easily, hide love?</p>
<p>its flame is obvious, displaying the evidence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile rules were laid down for you: to yoke the strong necks,</p>
<p>first, of fierce bulls to the unaccustomed plough.</p>
<p>They were the bulls of Mars, more cruel than just their horns,</p>
<p>also their exhalations were terrible with fire,</p>
<p>their hooves were solid bronze, and bronze coated their nostrils,</p>
<p>and these too were blackened by their breath.</p>
<p>Besides that, you were ordered to scatter seed to breed a nation,</p>
<p>through the wide fields, with dutiful hands,</p>
<p>who would attack your body with co-born spears:</p>
<p>a harvest hostile to the farmer.</p>
<p>Your last labour, by some art, to deceive the guardian</p>
<p>that knows no sleep, and make its eyes succumb.</p>
<p>So said King Aeetes: all rose sorrowfully,</p>
<p>and the shining benches were pushed from the high table.</p>
<p>How far, from you, then was the kingdom, Creusa&#8217;s dowry,</p>
<p>and your father-in-law, and that daughter of great Creon.</p>
<p>You leave, downcast. My wet gaze follows you as you go,</p>
<p>and my tenuous voice murmurs: &#8216;Fare well!&#8217;</p>
<p>Though I reached the bed, made up in my room, stricken grievously, how much of that night for me was spent in tears.</p>
<p>Before my eyes were the brazen bulls, the impious harvest,</p>
<p>before my sleepless eyes was the serpent.</p>
<p>Here is love, here fear &#8211; fear itself increased my love.</p>
<p>It was morning and my dear sister entered my room</p>
<p>and found me, with scattered hair, lying face downwards,</p>
<p>and everything drenched in my tears.</p>
<p>She prays for help for the Minyans: one asks, the other obtains:</p>
<p>what she requests for Aeson&#8217;s son, I give.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a wood, dark with pine and oak branches,</p>
<p>the sun&#8217;s rays can scarcely reach there:</p>
<p>in it, there is &#8211; or was for certain &#8211; a temple of Diana:</p>
<p>there a golden goddess stood made by barbarian hands.</p>
<p>Do you know it, or has the place been forgotten, along with me?</p>
<p>We came there: you began to speak first, with false words:</p>
<p>&#8216;Fortune indeed has given you the means of my salvation</p>
<p>and my life and death are in your hands.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s enough to destroy me if you were to delight in that:</p>
<p>but it will be more honour to you to help me.</p>
<p>I beg you by our troubles, which you can lighten,</p>
<p>by your race, and the divinity of the all-seeing Sun,</p>
<p>your grandfather, by Diana&#8217;s triple face and sacred mysteries,</p>
<p>and if my people&#8217;s gods have worth, those too:</p>
<p>O Virgin, take pity on me, take pity on my men,</p>
<p>grant me your services for all time!</p>
<p>If, perhaps, you do not scorn to have a Pelasgian husband -</p>
<p>but can it be so easily granted me, and by which of my gods? -</p>
<p>let my spirit vanish into thin air, if any bride</p>
<p>enters my bed, unless that bride be you.</p>
<p>Let Juno share in this, who oversees holy matrimony,</p>
<p>and that goddess in whose marble shrine we stand!&#8217;</p>
<p>This passion &#8211; and how much of it was words? -</p>
<p>moved a naive girl, and our right hands touched.</p>
<p>I even saw tears &#8211; or were they partly lies?</p>
<p>So I quickly became a girl captivated by your words.</p>
<p>And you yoked the brazen-footed steeds, your body un-scorched,</p>
<p>and split the solid earth with the plough, as you were ordered.</p>
<p>You filled the furrows with venomous teeth, instead of seed,</p>
<p>and warriors were born, armed with swords and shields.</p>
<p>I, who gave you the charms, sat there pale of face,</p>
<p>when I saw these men, suddenly born, take up arms,</p>
<p>until the earth-born brothers &#8211; marvellous happening! -</p>
<p>with drawn swords, joined battle amongst themselves.</p>
<p>Behold the sleepless guardian, coated with rattling scales,</p>
<p>hissed, and swept the ground with his writhing body.</p>
<p>Where was the rich dowry then? Where was the royal bride</p>
<p>for you then, and that Isthmus splitting the waters of twin seas?</p>
<p>I, the woman who has come to seem, at last, a barbarian to you,</p>
<p>who am now poor, who am now seen to be harmful,</p>
<p>subdued those burning eyes, with sleep-inducing drugs,</p>
<p>and safely gave you the fleece you carried away.</p>
<p>My father is betrayed, kingdom and country forsaken,</p>
<p>for which, it is right, my reward&#8217;s to suffer exile,</p>
<p>my virginity becomes the prize of a foreign thief,</p>
<p>my most dearly beloved sister, with my mother, lost.</p>
<p>But Absyrtus, my brother, I did not abandon you, fleeing without me.</p>
<p>This letter of mine is lacking in one thing:</p>
<p>what I dared to do my right hand cannot write.</p>
<p>So should I have been torn apart, but with you!</p>
<p>Yet I had no fear &#8211; what was to be feared after that? -</p>
<p>believing myself a woman at sea, already guilty.</p>
<p>Where is divine power? Where are the gods? Justice is near us</p>
<p>on the deep, you punished for fraud, I for credulity.</p>
<p>I wish that the clashing rocks, the Symplegades, had crushed us,</p>
<p>so that my bones might cling to your bones!</p>
<p>Or ravening Scylla might have caught us, to be eaten by her dogs!</p>
<p>Scylla is destined to harm ungrateful men.</p>
<p>And Charybdis, who so often swallows and spews out the tide,</p>
<p>should also have sucked us beneath Sicilian waters!</p>
<p>You return safe to the cities of Thessaly:</p>
<p>the golden fleece is placed before your gods.</p>
<p>Why speak of the daughters of Pelias, piously harming him,</p>
<p>and carving their father&#8217;s body with virgin hands?</p>
<p>Though others blame me, you must praise me,</p>
<p>you for whom I was forced to be so guilty.</p>
<p>You dared &#8211; oh words fail themselves, in righteous indignation! -</p>
<p>you dared to say: &#8216;Depart from Aeson&#8217;s house!&#8217;</p>
<p>As you ordered, I left the house, accompanied by our two children,</p>
<p>and, what will pursue me always, my love of you.</p>
<p>When suddenly the songs of Hymen came to my ears,</p>
<p>and the torches shone with illuminating fire,</p>
<p>and the flutes poured out the marriage tunes for you,</p>
<p>but a mournful funeral piping for me,</p>
<p>I was afraid, I hadn&#8217;t thought till now so much wickedness could be,</p>
<p>but still I was chilled through my whole body.</p>
<p>The crowd rushed on, continually shouting: &#8216;Hymen, Hymenaee!&#8217;</p>
<p>the nearer they came the worse it was for me.</p>
<p>The servants wept apart, and hid their tears -</p>
<p>who wants to be the bearer of such evil news?</p>
<p>It would have been better for me not to know what happened,</p>
<p>but it was as if I knew, my mind was sad,</p>
<p>when the younger of our sons, ordered to be on the lookout,</p>
<p>stationed at the outer threshold of the double doors, called to me:</p>
<p>&#8216;Mother, come here! Jason, my father, is leading the procession,</p>
<p>and he&#8217;s driving a team of gilded horses!&#8217;</p>
<p>Straightaway, tearing my clothes, I beat my breasts,</p>
<p>nor was my face safe from my nails.</p>
<p>My heart urged me to go, in procession, among the crowd,</p>
<p>and to throw away the garlands arranged in my hair.</p>
<p>I could scarcely keep myself from shouting, my hair dishevelled,</p>
<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s mine!&#8217; and taking possession of you.</p>
<p>My wounded father, rejoice! Colchians, forsaken, rejoice!</p>
<p>My brother&#8217;s shade, in me find offerings to the dead!</p>
<p>I abandon my lost kingdom, my country, my home,</p>
<p>my husband, who alone was everything to me.</p>
<p>Thus, I could subdue serpents and raging bulls,</p>
<p>but I could not subdue this one man.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve driven off wild fires with skilful potions,</p>
<p>but I&#8217;ve no power to turn the flames from myself.</p>
<p>My charms and herbs and arts forsake me,</p>
<p>nor does the goddess, sacred Hecate, act with power.</p>
<p>The day does not please me: I&#8217;m awake through nights of bitterness,</p>
<p>and gentle sleep is absent from my miserable breast.</p>
<p>What cannot make me sleep made a dragon sleep.</p>
<p>My cures are more use to others than myself.</p>
<p>My rival clasps that body that I saved</p>
<p>and she has the fruits of my labours.</p>
<p>Indeed, perhaps when you wish to mention married foolishness,</p>
<p>and speak in a way that suits unjust ears,</p>
<p>you invent new faults in my face, and my manner.</p>
<p>Let her laugh, and lie there, lifted up on Tyrian purple -</p>
<p>she&#8217;ll weep, and, scorched, she&#8217;ll surpass my fires.</p>
<p>While there are blades, and flames, and poisonous juices,</p>
<p>no enemy will go unpunished by Medea.</p>
<p>If by chance my prayers move your breast of steel</p>
<p>now hear these humble words from my heart.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m as much a suppliant, to you, as you often were to me,</p>
<p>nor do I hesitate to throw myself at your feet.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m worthless to you, consider the children we have:</p>
<p>a dread stepmother, in my place, will be cruel to them.</p>
<p>And they&#8217;re so like you, and touched by your semblance,</p>
<p>and as often as I see them, my eyes are wet with tears.</p>
<p>I beg you, by the gods, by the light of the Sun, my grandfather&#8217;s fire,</p>
<p>by my kindness to you, and by our two children, our pledges,</p>
<p>return to the bed for which I, insanely, abandoned so many things!</p>
<p>Add truth to your words, and return the help I gave you!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t beg your help against bulls, or warriors,</p>
<p>or that a dragon sleeps conquered by your aid:</p>
<p>I ask for you, whom I deserve, who gave yourself to me,</p>
<p>a father by whom I was equally made a mother.</p>
<p>You ask, where&#8217;s my dowry? I numbered it on that field</p>
<p>that was ploughed by you, in taking the fleece.</p>
<p>My dowry&#8217;s that golden ram known by its thick fleece,</p>
<p>that you&#8217;d deny me if I said to you: &#8216;Return it.&#8217;</p>
<p>My dowry is your safety: my dowry&#8217;s the youth of Greece.</p>
<p>Cruel man, go: compare this to the wealth of Corinth.</p>
<p>That you live, that you have a wife and powerful father-in-law,</p>
<p>that you can even be ungrateful, all that&#8217;s due to me.</p>
<p>Indeed, what&#8217;s on hand &#8211; but why should I be concerned to warn you of your punishment? Great anger teems with threats.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll follow where anger takes me. Perhaps I&#8217;ll regret my deeds:</p>
<p>I regret having been concerned for an unfaithful husband.</p>
<p>Let the god see to that, who now disturbs my heart.</p>
<p>Assuredly I do not know what moves my spirit most.</p>
<p>XIII: Laodamia to Protesilaus
</p>
<p>She, who sends this, wishes loving greetings to go to whom it&#8217;s sent:</p>
<p>from Thessaly to Thessaly&#8217;s lord, Laodamia to her husband.</p>
<p>Rumour has it you&#8217;re held at Aulis by delaying winds:</p>
<p>ah! when you left me, where were those winds then?</p>
<p>Then the sea should have obstructed your oars:</p>
<p>that would have been a useful time for raging waters.</p>
<p>I might have given my husband more kisses, and more requests,</p>
<p>and there was much I wanted to say to him.</p>
<p>You were driven headlong from here and there was a wind that might have been summoned for your sails, that the sailors loved, not I.</p>
<p>It was a wind fit for a sailor, not one fit for a lover:</p>
<p>I was freed from your embrace, Protesilaus, and my tongue,</p>
<p>commissioning you, left the words unfinished:</p>
<p>it could scarcely say a sad: &#8216;Farewell.&#8217;</p>
<p>The North Wind leaned down, and filled your departing sails,</p>
<p>and soon my Protesilaus was far away.</p>
<p>While I could still see my husband, I delighted in watching</p>
<p>and your eyes were followed, all the way, by mine:</p>
<p>when I could no longer see you, I could see your sail,</p>
<p>your sail held my gaze for a long time.</p>
<p>But once I could not see you, or your vanishing sail,</p>
<p>and I could look at nothing except the waves,</p>
<p>the light went with you too, and suffocating darkness rising,</p>
<p>they say that, my knees failed, and I sank to the ground.</p>
<p>Your father Iphiclus, and mine, aged Acastus, and my mother</p>
<p>could scarcely revive me, with icy water, in my misery.</p>
<p>They went about their kind action, but vainly for me:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m angry I wasn&#8217;t allowed to die in my distress.</p>
<p>When consciousness returned, my pain returned with it:</p>
<p>a rightful affection hurts my chaste heart.</p>
<p>I take no care about displaying my hair neatly combed,</p>
<p>nor does it please me to cover my body with golden dresses.</p>
<p>I run, here and there, like one you&#8217;d think had been touched</p>
<p>by the rod of the twin-horned god, just as madness drives me.</p>
<p>The women of Phylace gather round, and they call to me:</p>
<p>&#8216;Put on your royal garments, Laodamia!&#8217;</p>
<p>Of course she should wear clothes steeped in purple,</p>
<p>while he wars beneath the walls of Troy!</p>
<p>She to comb her hair? A helmet to weigh his down?</p>
<p>She should bear new dresses, her husband heavy armour?</p>
<p>Let them say, that as I can, I imitate your hardships, with harshness,</p>
<p>and, by my circumstances, act out the sad war.</p>
<p>Paris, son of Priam, harmful to your people through your beauty,</p>
<p>be as cowardly an enemy as you were an evil guest!</p>
<p>I wish you&#8217;d reproached your Spartan bride for her character,</p>
<p>or that she&#8217;d been displeased with yours.</p>
<p>Menelaus you suffer too much for the one you lost,</p>
<p>alas! with what grieving you&#8217;ll avenge her.</p>
<p>Gods, I beg you, keep all dark omens from us</p>
<p>and let my husband dedicate weapons to Jove, on his return!</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m afraid whenever the miserable war comes to mind:</p>
<p>my tears flow like snows melting in the sun.</p>
<p>Troy and Tenedos, Simois, Xanthus, Ida, are names</p>
<p>that almost scare me by their very sound.</p>
<p>That guest would not have dared to take her, unless</p>
<p>he could defend himself: he knew his strength.</p>
<p>He came, as rumour has it, remarkable with all that gold,</p>
<p>bearing the wealth of Phrygia on his back,</p>
<p>powerful in men, and ships, to wage a war -</p>
<p>and what part, and how much, of his kingdom follow him?</p>
<p>I suspect these things conquered you, sister of Leda&#8217;s Twins,</p>
<p>I think these things may bring disaster on the Greeks.</p>
<p>I do not know this Hector whom I fear: Paris said that Hector</p>
<p>wages war with a blood-stained sword in his hand:</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m dear to you, beware Hector, whoever he might be:</p>
<p>have the memory of that name stamped on your heart!</p>
<p>When you shun him, remember to shun the others,</p>
<p>and imagine there are many Hectors there,</p>
<p>and make sure you say, when you prepare to fight:</p>
<p>&#8216;Laodamia herself ordered me to forbear.&#8217;</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s possible for Troy to fall to the Greek army,</p>
<p>let it fall without you receiving any wounds.</p>
<p>Let Menelaus fight and strain against the enemy:</p>
<p>among enemies, let the wife be sought by the husband.</p>
<p>Your cause is different: fight so as to live,</p>
<p>and be able to return to your wife&#8217;s loving breast!</p>
<p>I beg you, Trojans, spare this one of all your enemies,</p>
<p>don&#8217;t let my blood flow from his body!</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not one to charge into battle with naked blade</p>
<p>and bear savage feelings towards men.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s better suited, by far, to making love than fighting.</p>
<p>Let others make war: let Protesilaus love!</p>
<p>Now I confess: I wish I&#8217;d called you back, and shown my feelings:</p>
<p>my tongue was stilled, for fear of evil omens.</p>
<p>When you wished to leave your father&#8217;s door,</p>
<p>your feet showed signs of stumbling on the threshold.</p>
<p>When I saw, I groaned, and said, secretly in my heart:</p>
<p>&#8216;I pray this might be a sign of my husband&#8217;s returning!&#8217;</p>
<p>I tell you this now, so you aren&#8217;t too brave in battle.</p>
<p>Make sure all my fears vanish on the wind!</p>
<p>Also I know not what unjust death fate promises,</p>
<p>to the first Greek who touches Trojan soil:</p>
<p>unhappy the woman who grieves for the first man slain!</p>
<p>I wish the gods might not make you over-eager!</p>
<p>Among the thousand ships let yours be the thousandth,</p>
<p>and the last to be wrecked by the tormenting waters!</p>
<p>This also I forewarn you of: be the last to leave the vessel!</p>
<p>Where you land is not your father&#8217;s country.</p>
<p>When you return sail your ship with canvas and oars together,</p>
<p>and reach your own shore with all speed!</p>
<p>Whether Phoebus hides, or stands high above the earth,</p>
<p>come quickly to me by day, or come to me by night:</p>
<p>All the better if you come at night. Night is pleasing to girls,</p>
<p>whose necks have arms to embrace them.</p>
<p>I try to grasp deceitful dreams in my empty bed:</p>
<p>while I&#8217;m without true joys, false ones must give me pleasure.</p>
<p>But why does your pale image appear to me?</p>
<p>Why do so many plaintive sounds rise to your lips?</p>
<p>I shake off sleep, and revere these phantoms of the night:</p>
<p>no altar in Thessaly&#8217;s free from the smoke of my gifts:</p>
<p>I offer incense, with tears too, that blazes as it&#8217;s scattered,</p>
<p>so that the flames sputter, as they do when wine&#8217;s poured on.</p>
<p>When will I lead you home again, clasped in my loving arms,</p>
<p>to free my joy from this listlessness?</p>
<p>When will it be, that, truly joined with me in the one bed,</p>
<p>you&#8217;ll recall the splendid deeds of your battles?</p>
<p>While you tell me of them, while listening delights,</p>
<p>you&#8217;ll still snatch many kisses, and give many in return.</p>
<p>rightly, in their retelling, the words are stopped:</p>
<p>the tongue&#8217;s more easily refreshed by sweet delay.</p>
<p>But when Troy comes to mind, so do the winds and seas:</p>
<p>firm hope fails, overcome by anxious fears.</p>
<p>It troubles me too, that the winds prevent your ship from leaving:</p>
<p>you prepare to go with the waves against you.</p>
<p>Who would return to his country, obstructed by the wind?</p>
<p>You sail, from your country, though the sea denies you!</p>
<p>Neptune himself offers no road, to his own city, Troy.</p>
<p>Where do you rush to? Go back to your homes!</p>
<p>Where do you rush to, Greeks? Heed the winds&#8217; denial!</p>
<p>This is no sudden chance &#8211; this is divine delay.</p>
<p>What do you seek by such warfare but a shameful adulteress?</p>
<p>Ships, from the Inachus, back your sails while you may!</p>
<p>What do I say? Do I call you back? Let the omen at your going</p>
<p>be recalled, and gentle winds might favour calm seas.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m envious of the Trojan women, who, though they see</p>
<p>the tearful funerals of their people, though the enemy are nearby,</p>
<p>the new bride herself, with her own hands, places the helmet</p>
<p>on her brave husband&#8217;s head, and gives him his Trojan weapons:</p>
<p>gives him his weapons, and while she does so, snatches a kiss -</p>
<p>that kind of service will be sweet for both -</p>
<p>and she leads her husband out, and gives him orders to return,</p>
<p>and says: &#8216;Be sure you bring Jove&#8217;s weapons back!&#8217;</p>
<p>Bearing his lady&#8217;s recent orders with him,</p>
<p>he&#8217;ll fight with caution, and see their home again.</p>
<p>Leading him back, she takes his shield, loosens his helmet again,</p>
<p>and takes his weary body to her breast.</p>
<p>We are unsure: troubled, everything hems us in:</p>
<p>whatever might happen, fear thinks it fact.</p>
<p>While you bear arms, a soldier in a remote world,</p>
<p>your wax image recalls your face to me:</p>
<p>I speak endearments to it, words that I owe to you,</p>
<p>and it receives my embrace.</p>
<p>Believe me this image is more than it seems:</p>
<p>add sound to wax, and it would be Protesilaus.</p>
<p>I gaze at it, and hold it to my breast, in place of my true husband</p>
<p>and I complain to it, as if it might answer back.</p>
<p>By your return, by your body, by my gods, I swear,</p>
<p>and by the twin torches of our love and our marriage,</p>
<p>and by your head, itself, that you might bring back to me again,</p>
<p>so that I might see its grey hairs grow in time to white,</p>
<p>wherever you call from to me, I will come to accompany you,</p>
<p>whether what &#8211; alas! &#8211; I fear might be, or whether you survive.</p>
<p>Let this letter end with a last small request:</p>
<p>if you care for me, let your care be for yourself!</p>
<p>XIV: Hypermestra to Lynceus
</p>
<p>Hypermestra sends this letter to her one cousin of many,</p>
<p>the rest lie dead because of their brides&#8217; crime.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m held prisoner in this house, confined by heavy chains:</p>
<p>that&#8217;s my punishment because I was virtuous.</p>
<p>Because my hand was afraid to plunge a blade into a throat,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guilty: I would be praised if I&#8217;d dared to be wicked.</p>
<p>Better to be guilty, than to have pleased a parent so:</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t regret my hands are free of blood.</p>
<p>Father might burn me, with the fire I didn&#8217;t violate,</p>
<p>and hold in my face the torches, that were present at my rites.</p>
<p>or cut my throat, with the sword he wrongly gave me,</p>
<p>so that I might die the death my husband did not -</p>
<p>he still won&#8217;t make my dying mouth say: &#8216;I repent!&#8217;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not possible to regret being virtuous!</p>
<p>Wicked Danaus, my father, and my savage sisters should repent:</p>
<p>that&#8217;s the customary thing that follows wicked deeds.</p>
<p>My heart trembles, remembering the blood of that shameful night,</p>
<p>and a sudden tremor binds together the bones of my right hand.</p>
<p>The woman, you might think had the power to perform the murder</p>
<p>of her husband, is afraid to write of deeds of murder not her own!</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ll still try. Twilight had just begun on earth,</p>
<p>it was the last of light, and the first of night.</p>
<p>We, scions of Inachus, are led beneath Pelasgus&#8217;s noble roof,</p>
<p>and there the father-in-law welcomes the armed daughters.</p>
<p>Everywhere lamps, encircled by gold, are shining:</p>
<p>and incense is impiously offered to unwilling flames.</p>
<p>The crowd of men shout: &#8216;Hymen, Hymenaee!&#8217; He flees their shouts:</p>
<p>Juno herself abandons her city of Argos.</p>
<p>See how, fuddled with wine, to the cries of many friends,</p>
<p>their drenched hair crowned with flowers,</p>
<p>they&#8217;re carried to the joyful bedrooms &#8211; rooms to be their graves -</p>
<p>and weigh down the beds, worthy to be their biers.</p>
<p>So they lay there, heavy with food, and wine, and sleep,</p>
<p>and there was deep peace throughout carefree Argos.</p>
<p>I seemed to hear around me the groans of dying men</p>
<p>and I did indeed hear, and what I feared was true.</p>
<p>My colour went, and mind, and body, lost their warmth,</p>
<p>and I lay there, chilled, in my new marriage bed.</p>
<p>As slender stalks of wheat quiver in a mild west wind,</p>
<p>as cold breezes stir the poplar leaves,</p>
<p>I trembled so, and more. You yourself lay there,</p>
<p>and were drowsy, as the wine had made you.</p>
<p>My cruel father&#8217;s order drove away my fear:</p>
<p>I rose, and grasped the weapon with shaking hand.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t tell a lie. Three times I lifted the sharp blade,</p>
<p>three times my hand lowered the sword it wickedly raised.</p>
<p>I confess the truth to you despite myself: I pointed it</p>
<p>at your throat: still overcome by cruel terror of my father,</p>
<p>I pointed my father&#8217;s sword at your throat:</p>
<p>but fear and piety hindered the cruel act,</p>
<p>and my chaste hand fled the work demanded.</p>
<p>Tearing my purple robes, tearing at my hair</p>
<p>in a whisper I spoke these words:</p>
<p>&#8216;You father&#8217;s cruel towards you, Hypermestra: act out</p>
<p>his order: let your husband join his brothers!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m female and a young girl, gentle by age and nature:</p>
<p>fierce weapons are no use in tender hands.</p>
<p>Why not act while he lies there, imitate your brave sisters:</p>
<p>it&#8217;s possible all the husbands have been killed?</p>
<p>If this hand had any power to commit murder,</p>
<p>it would be bloodied by the death of its mistress.</p>
<p>They deserved to die for taking their uncle&#8217;s kingdom:</p>
<p>but suppose our husbands deserved to die, we who</p>
<p>were given to strangers: what have we ourselves done?</p>
<p>What crime have I committed that I&#8217;m not allowed to be virtuous?</p>
<p>What have I to do with swords? Or a girl with warlike weapons?</p>
<p>My hands are more suited to the distaff and wool.&#8217;</p>
<p>So I whispered. While I lamented, tears chased my words,</p>
<p>and fell from my eyes onto your body.</p>
<p>While you seek my embrace, and, still asleep, stir your arms,</p>
<p>your hand is almost wounded by my weapon.</p>
<p>And now I feared my father, his servants, and the light.</p>
<p>These words of mine dispelled your sleep:</p>
<p>&#8216;Rise and go, scion of Belus, sole one of many cousins!<br />
This night will be yours eternally, unless you hurry!&#8217;</p>
<p>You rose in terror, shaking off all the weight of sleep,</p>
<p>you saw the sharp sword in my timid hand.</p>
<p>You ask why: I say: &#8216;Flee, while the night allows!&#8217;</p>
<p>While night&#8217;s darkness itself allows, you flee, I remain.</p>
<p>It was dawn, and Danaus counted his sons-in-law lying dead,</p>
<p>One&#8217;s missing from the tally of crime.</p>
<p>He takes it badly, downcast by one among these dead relations,</p>
<p>and complains that the acts of blood are unfinished.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m dragged by my hair, from my father&#8217;s, feet to prison -</p>
<p>is this the reward I deserve for my virtue?</p>
<p>No doubt Juno&#8217;s anger lasted from the time when Io was changed</p>
<p>from girl to heifer, till a goddess was made of that heifer -</p>
<p>but Jove&#8217;s punishment was enough, that a tender girl bellowed,</p>
<p>her beauty in no way able to please him.</p>
<p>The new heifer stood on the banks of her father&#8217;s stream</p>
<p>and saw horns not hers, in her father&#8217;s waves,</p>
<p>and, lowing, tried to lament with her mouth,</p>
<p>and was frightened by her form, and by her voice.</p>
<p>Why are you maddened, unhappy one? Why gaze at yourself</p>
<p>in the water? Why count the feet formed from your new limbs?</p>
<p>A rival, feared by that sister of mighty Jupiter,</p>
<p>you ease your great hunger with leaves and grass:</p>
<p>you drink from springs, and, stunned, see your shape,</p>
<p>and fear lest the weapons you bear might kill you.</p>
<p>You were once rich enough to be fit to be seen even by Jove,</p>
<p>naked you lie on the naked earth.</p>
<p>You wander by the sea, and the lands, and their rivers:</p>
<p>the sea, the streams, the land grant you a way.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the reason for your flight? Oh, Io! Why wander vast straits?</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t escape from your own features.</p>
<p>Daughter of Inachus, where do you hasten to? The same form</p>
<p>flees and follows: you&#8217;re guide to a follower, follower to a guide.</p>
<p>The Nile flowing to the sea through seven gates</p>
<p>drove out the maddened heifer from the girl&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Why recall these earliest things, sung to me by ancient authors?</p>
<p>Behold, my own life gives me things to lament.</p>
<p>My father and my uncle wage war: we&#8217;re expelled from home</p>
<p>and from our kingdom: driven to inhabit furthest places.</p>
<p>That warlike one, alone, is master of solitude and power:</p>
<p>while we wander a helpless crowd, with a helpless old man.</p>
<p>Of the horde of cousins the least part remains:</p>
<p>I weep for those given death, and those who gave it.</p>
<p>For as many cousins as I lost, I lost as many sisters:</p>
<p>let both groups of them receive my tears.</p>
<p>But I, because you live, am kept for punishment&#8217;s torment:</p>
<p>what becomes of guilt, when I&#8217;m tormented for things men praise?</p>
<p>Unhappy, I may die with only one cousin left, I once</p>
<p>a hundredth of a crowded family.</p>
<p>But you, Lynceus, if you care for your virtuous cousin</p>
<p>and are worthy of the gift I gave you,</p>
<p>bring me help or bring me death: and add my body,</p>
<p>when life is gone, to the secret fires,</p>
<p>and bury my bones, drenched with your loyal tears,</p>
<p>and let these brief lines be carved on my tomb:</p>
<p>&#8216;Hypermestra, an exile, bore the unjust price of virtue,</p>
<p>she who averted death from her cousin.&#8217;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to write more to you, but my hand&#8217;s dragged down</p>
<p>by the weight of chains, and fear itself drains my strength.</p>
<p>XV: Sappho to Phaon
</p>
<p>When these letters, from my eager hand, are examined</p>
<p>are any of them known to your eyes, straight away, as mine?</p>
<p>Or would you not know where this work came from</p>
<p>in short, unless you&#8217;d read the name of its author, Sappho?</p>
<p>Indeed, perhaps you ask why my lines alternate,</p>
<p>when I&#8217;m more suited to the lyric mode:</p>
<p>my love is weeping: it&#8217;s elegiac verse that weeps:</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t set any of my tears to the lyre.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m scorched, as a cornfield burns, its rich crop set alight</p>
<p>by a wild south-easterly, bringing lightning.</p>
<p>Phaon frequents the far fields of Typhoeus&#8217;s Etna:</p>
<p>passion grips me no less fiercely than Etna&#8217;s fire.</p>
<p>Songs to the well-tuned strings don&#8217;t rise in me:</p>
<p>song is the work of a mind at leisure.</p>
<p>Nor do the girls of Pyrrha, or Methymna delight me,</p>
<p>nor the rest of the Lesbian throng.</p>
<p>Worthless is Anactoria, lovely Cydro&#8217;s worthless, to me,</p>
<p>while Atthis isn&#8217;t pleasing to my eyes,</p>
<p>nor a hundred others that I&#8217;ve loved guiltily.</p>
<p>Cruel man, one alone has what was a multitude&#8217;s!</p>
<p>Beauty is yours, years suited to loving,</p>
<p>oh, treacherous beauty to my eyes!</p>
<p>Take up the lyre, and archery &#8211; you&#8217;ll surely become Apollo:</p>
<p>add horns to your head &#8211; it&#8217;s Bacchus that you&#8217;ll be.</p>
<p>And Phoebus loved Daphne: Bacchus loved Ariadne,</p>
<p>neither she nor she knew the lyric mode.</p>
<p>But the Muses compose the sweetest songs for me:</p>
<p>now, my name is sung throughout the world:</p>
<p>Alcaeus is not more praised, who shares the lyre</p>
<p>and my country, even though he may sound more grand.</p>
<p>If nature, being difficult, denies me beauty,</p>
<p>my genius repays beauty&#8217;s loss.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m small. But mine&#8217;s a name that fills every country:</p>
<p>I reveal the measure of the name itself.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m not pale, Andromeda pleased Perseus,</p>
<p>dark with the colour of her father Cepheus&#8217;s land.</p>
<p>and often white pigeons mate with other hues,</p>
<p>and the dark turtledove&#8217;s loved by emerald birds.</p>
<p>If nothing but what&#8217;s possessed by beauty will seem worthy to you,</p>
<p>none will be yours in future, none will be yours in future!</p>
<p>But when I read my poems, I seemed beautiful enough, indeed</p>
<p>you swore I was the only one, fit to speak for ever.</p>
<p>I sang, I remember (lovers remember everything),</p>
<p>and, while I sang, you gave me stolen kisses.</p>
<p>Those too you praised, I pleased you in all ways</p>
<p>but especially there, where Love&#8217;s work was done.</p>
<p>Then you enjoyed my playfulness more than ever</p>
<p>and endless teasing, appropriate laughing words,</p>
<p>and when we were both abandoned to pleasure,</p>
<p>that deepest languor of our weary bodies.</p>
<p>Now Sicilian girls come to you as new prizes.</p>
<p>What is Lesbos to me? I wish I were Sicilian.</p>
<p>Oh you Nisean mothers, and Nisean daughters,</p>
<p>send back the wanderer from your shores!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let the lying endearments of his tongue deceive you:</p>
<p>what he says to you, he said before to me.</p>
<p>You also Venus, Erycina, who frequents Sicilian hills</p>
<p>(since I am yours) look to your poet, goddess!</p>
<p>Or must my painful fate fulfil its tender beginning,</p>
<p>and always be bitter in its course.</p>
<p>Six birthdays had gone when my father&#8217;s bones, gathered</p>
<p>before his time, drank of my tears.</p>
<p>Helplessly, Charaxus, my brother, captivated, burnt with love</p>
<p>of a whore, and suffered disgraceful losses, mixed with shame.</p>
<p>He wanders, poverty stricken, over the blue sea, with fast oars,</p>
<p>and sinfully seeks now, the wealth he sinfully lost.</p>
<p>He hates me too, because, from great loyalty, I warned him, clearly:</p>
<p>that&#8217;s what frankness, and conscientiousness brought me.</p>
<p>And just as what I miss torments me, endlessly,</p>
<p>so a young daughter adds to my cares.</p>
<p>You give me a final reason for complaint:</p>
<p>our ship&#8217;s not driven by favourable winds.</p>
<p>Look, my scattered hair lies lawlessly about by neck,</p>
<p>no bright jewels clasp my fingers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m covered by cheap cloth, no gold&#8217;s in my hair,</p>
<p>my tresses hold no perfumed gifts of Araby.</p>
<p>Unhappy, for whom should I dress, for whom labour to please?</p>
<p>The sole author of my adornments has gone.</p>
<p>My heart&#8217;s easily vulnerable, and to slender weapons,</p>
<p>and often the cause is that I often love,</p>
<p>Either the Fatal Sisters uttered it as a law, at my birth,</p>
<p>and no thread of discipline was granted to my life,</p>
<p>or inclination becomes habit, and my muse Thalia,</p>
<p>my instructress in art, made my genius prone to love.</p>
<p>Why wonder if men in their first youth captivated me</p>
<p>and those years in which a man&#8217;s first able to love?</p>
<p>I should fear lest you steal him away, Aurora, in place of Cephalus!</p>
<p>(and you would, but your first love holds you!)</p>
<p>If the Moon goddess should see him, she who sees everything,</p>
<p>it&#8217;s Phaon, not Endymion, who&#8217;ll be ordered to remain asleep.</p>
<p>Venus might have carried him off into the sky, in her ivory chariot,</p>
<p>but she might think he&#8217;d please Mars, himself.</p>
<p>Oh lovely years: not yet a man, nor still a boy,</p>
<p>Oh honour and great glory of your age,</p>
<p>come to me, handsome one, sink into my arms again:</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t ask you should love, only let yourself be loved!</p>
<p>I write, and my eyes are wet with rising tears:</p>
<p>look at the many blots here in this place.</p>
<p>If you were so certain of leaving, you might have behaved better,</p>
<p>and at least have said: &#8216;Woman of Lesbos, farewell!&#8217;</p>
<p>You carried away no tears, no kisses of mine:</p>
<p>in short I felt no fear of the pain that was.</p>
<p>Nothing of you is left me, only injury. Nor have you</p>
<p>any token of love to remind you.</p>
<p>I gave you no requests. Nor truly should I have given any,</p>
<p>except that you should not be unmindful of me.</p>
<p>I swear, by Love who is never far from you,</p>
<p>and by the Nine Muses, my divinities,</p>
<p>when whoever it might be said to me: &#8216;Your joys depart&#8217;,</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t cry for ages, nor could I speak:</p>
<p>tears indeed failed my eyes, words failed my tongue,</p>
<p>my heart was frozen by an icy chill.</p>
<p>When grief came to itself, I was not ashamed</p>
<p>to beat my breast, and howl as I tore my hair,</p>
<p>no differently than that holy mother who carries the body,</p>
<p>of her dead son, empty of life, to the heaped-up pyre.</p>
<p>My brother Charaxus delights in, thrives on, my misery,</p>
<p>and he reappears and fades before my eyes,</p>
<p>And that the reason for my grief might seem shameful,</p>
<p>he says: &#8216;Why grieve at this? Surely her daughter lives!&#8217;</p>
<p>Shame and love do not come together: all the crowd saw:</p>
<p>I was there with torn clothes and naked breasts.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re my care, Phaon: you&#8217;re restored to me in dreams -</p>
<p>dreams brighter than the beauty of the day.</p>
<p>There I find you, though you&#8217;re far from this sphere:</p>
<p>but the joys of sleep don&#8217;t last for long enough.</p>
<p>often your arms feel the weight of my neck,</p>
<p>often I seem to place mine beneath yours.</p>
<p>I recognise the kisses you engaged in with your tongue,</p>
<p>and used to be ready to take, and to give.</p>
<p>Now and then I caress you, and speak words that are almost real,</p>
<p>and my lips alone guard my thoughts -</p>
<p>I blush to tell more, but everything takes place -</p>
<p>and I please &#8211; and I&#8217;m not allowed to thirst.</p>
<p>But when the Sun shows himself, and all things along with him,</p>
<p>then I complain that sleep&#8217;s quickly left me:</p>
<p>I seek the caves and woods, as if the woods and caves</p>
<p>might help me: they have shared my pleasures.</p>
<p>Then I suffer a vacant mind that resembles fearful Enyo&#8217;s,</p>
<p>goddess of war, with hair loose about her neck.</p>
<p>I see rough tufa that hangs from the caves,</p>
<p>that to me was the equal of Phrygian marble:</p>
<p>I find the grove again, which often offered us a bed,</p>
<p>and hid us with a host of shadowy leaves.</p>
<p>But I do not find the lord of woods and me,</p>
<p>the place itself is worthless &#8211; he was its dowry.</p>
<p>I recognise crushed herbs in the familiar turf:</p>
<p>the grass was bent by our weight.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve lain down, and touched the place where you were:</p>
<p>a herb, that welcomed me before, drinks my tears.</p>
<p>Indeed the very branches seem to mourn with falling leaves</p>
<p>and there are no birds sweetly singing.</p>
<p>Only Procne, grief-stricken mother, unholy punisher of her husband,</p>
<p>as a bird now, sings of Thracian Itys of Daulis.</p>
<p>The bird sings of Itys: Sappho of forsaken love:</p>
<p>so far, they&#8217;re, otherwise, as silent as midnight.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a sacred fountain, shining, clearer than any crystal:</p>
<p>many think a divine spirit lives there.</p>
<p>Over it water-lotus unfolds its branches, itself a grove,</p>
<p>the earth is green with tender turf.</p>
<p>Here, when, weeping, I laid down my weary limbs,</p>
<p>a Naiad stood before my eyes:</p>
<p>she stood there and said: &#8216;Since you burn with the fires of injustice,</p>
<p>Ambracia&#8217;s the land to be sought by you.</p>
<p>Apollo on the heights watches the open sea:</p>
<p>summoning the people of Actium and Leucadia.</p>
<p>Here Deucalion, fired by love of Pyrrha, cast himself down,</p>
<p>and struck the sea without harming his body.</p>
<p>Without delay love turned and fled, from his slowly sinking</p>
<p>breast: Deucalion was eased of his passion.</p>
<p>The place obeys that law. Seek out the Leucadian height</p>
<p>right away, and don&#8217;t be afraid to leap from the rock!</p>
<p>As she as instructing me, she vanished, with her voice. I rose,</p>
<p>chilled, and the tears ceased flowing from my eyes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll go, oh Nymph, and seek the rock you&#8217;ve shown me:</p>
<p>let fear be far from me, conquered by frantic love.</p>
<p>Whatever comes will be better than what is. Breeze,</p>
<p>support me &#8211; indeed, my body has no great weight.</p>
<p>You also, sweet Love, lift me on your wings as I fall,</p>
<p>lest my death be charged to Leucadia&#8217;s waters.</p>
<p>Then I&#8217;ll set up my lyre to Phoebus, the gift we share,</p>
<p>and beneath it this pair of verses, one below the other:</p>
<p>&#8216;The grateful poetess, Sappho, sets up this lyre, to you, Apollo:</p>
<p>appropriate to me, it is appropriate for you.&#8217;</p>
<p>Still, why do you send me, unhappy, to Actium&#8217;s shore,</p>
<p>when you yourself could turn your wandering feet back to me?</p>
<p>You&#8217;d be better for me than Leucadia&#8217;s waves:</p>
<p>and you could be Phoebus to me, in beauty and kindness.</p>
<p>Perhaps if I die, oh you, fiercer than any cliff or sea,</p>
<p>might bear the infamy of my death?</p>
<p>Ah how much better to join my thoughts to yours,</p>
<p>than that they should be given to the rocks in headlong fall!</p>
<p>These are they, Phaon, which you used to praise</p>
<p>and seemed to you to be so ingenious.</p>
<p>I wish I was eloquent now! Pain obstructs art</p>
<p>and my ills put paid to every talent.</p>
<p>My old powers of song won&#8217;t awaken for me:</p>
<p>the plectrum falls silent through grief, and silent the lyre.</p>
<p>Lesbian women of the waves, those to be married: those married,</p>
<p>Lesbian women, names sung to the Aeolian lyre,</p>
<p>Lesbian women, beloved women, who made me infamous,</p>
<p>cease to come, in a crowd, to the melodies of my lyre!</p>
<p>Phaon has stolen what pleased you so before,</p>
<p>ah me! I nearly said, as once I did: &#8216;My Phaon.&#8217;</p>
<p>Make him return. Your singer too will return.</p>
<p>He gave my genius power: he snatched it away.</p>
<p>Do I rouse his savage heart moved by my prayers, or does it freeze, and the west winds carry away my fleeting words?</p>
<p>I wish those that carry them would bring back your sails:</p>
<p>That, if you only knew it, sluggard, would be the right thing to do.</p>
<p>If you are returning, and prepare a votive offering for the stern,</p>
<p>why torment my heart by your delay?</p>
<p>Loose your ship! Venus, born from the sea, offers the sea to lovers.</p>
<p>The winds will give you way &#8211; only loose your ship!</p>
<p>Cupid himself will pilot it, settled on the stern:</p>
<p>he&#8217;ll furl and unfurl the sails himself, with his delicate hand.</p>
<p>If you wish to flee far from Sappho of Greece,</p>
<p>(you&#8217;ll still find no reason why I&#8217;m worthy of being shunned)</p>
<p>a harsh letter might at least speak that misery,</p>
<p>so that death might be sought by me in Leucadia&#8217;s waters.</p>
