				<p>The Story of Alcithoe and her Sisters</p>
<p>Yet still Alcithoe perverse remains, <br />
And Bacchus still, and all his rites, disdains. <br />
Too rash, and madly bold, she bids him prove <br />
Himself a God, nor owns the son of Jove. <br />
Her sisters too unanimous agree, <br />
Faithful associates in impiety. <br />
Be this a solemn feast, the priest had said; <br />
Be, with each mistress, unemploy&#8217;d each maid. <br />
With skins of beasts your tender limbs enclose, <br />
And with an ivy-crown adorn your brows, <br />
The leafy Thyrsus high in triumph bear, <br />
And give your locks to wanton in the air.</p>
<p>These rites profan&#8217;d, the holy seer foreshow&#8217;d <br />
A mourning people, and a vengeful God.</p>
<p>Matrons and pious wives obedience show, <br />
Distaffs, and wooll, half spun, away they throw: <br />
Then incense burn, and, Bacchus, thee adore, <br />
Or lov&#8217;st thou Nyseus, or Lyaeus more? <br />
O! doubly got, O! doubly born, they sung, <br />
Thou mighty Bromius, hail, from light&#8217;ning sprung! <br />
Hail, Thyon, Eleleus! each name is thine: <br />
Or, listen parent of the genial vine! <br />
Iachus! Evan! loudly they repeat, <br />
And not one Grecian attribute forget, <br />
Which to thy praise, great Deity, belong, <br />
Stil&#8217;d justly Liber in the Roman song. <br />
Eternity of youth is thine! enjoy <br />
Years roul&#8217;d on years, yet still a blooming boy. <br />
In Heav&#8217;n thou shin&#8217;st with a superior grace; <br />
Conceal thy horns, and &#8217;tis a virgin&#8217;s face. <br />
Thou taught&#8217;st the tawny Indian to obey, <br />
And Ganges, smoothly flowing, own&#8217;d thy sway. <br />
Lycurgus, Pentheus, equally profane, <br />
By thy just vengeance equally were slain. <br />
By thee the Tuscans, who conspir&#8217;d to keep <br />
Thee captive, plung&#8217;d, and cut with finns the deep. <br />
With painted reins, all-glitt&#8217;ring from afar, <br />
The spotted lynxes proudly draw thy car. <br />
Around, the Bacchae, and the satyrs throng; <br />
Behind, Silenus, drunk, lags slow along: <br />
On his dull ass he nods from side to side, <br />
Forbears to fall, yet half forgets to ride. <br />
Still at thy near approach, applauses loud <br />
Are heard, with yellings of the female crowd. <br />
Timbrels, and boxen pipes, with mingled cries, <br />
Swell up in sounds confus&#8217;d, and rend the skies. <br />
Come, Bacchus, come propitious, all implore, <br />
And act thy sacred orgies o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er.</p>
<p>But Mineus&#8217; daughters, while these rites were pay&#8217;d, <br />
At home, impertinently busie, stay&#8217;d. <br />
Their wicked tasks they ply with various art, <br />
And thro&#8217; the loom the sliding shuttle dart; <br />
Or at the fire to comb the wooll they stand, <br />
Or twirl the spindle with a dext&#8217;rous hand. <br />
Guilty themselves, they force the guiltless in; <br />
Their maids, who share the labour, share the sin. <br />
At last one sister cries, who nimbly knew <br />
To draw nice threads, and winde the finest clue, <br />
While others idly rove, and Gods revere, <br />
Their fancy&#8217;d Gods! they know not who, or where; <br />
Let us, whom Pallas taught her better arts, <br />
Still working, cheer with mirthful chat our hearts, <br />
And to deceive the time, let me prevail <br />
With each by turns to tell some antique tale. <br />
She said: her sisters lik&#8217;d the humour well, <br />
And smiling, bad her the first story tell. <br />
But she a-while profoundly seem&#8217;d to muse, <br />
Perplex&#8217;d amid variety to chuse: <br />
And knew not, whether she should first relate <br />
The poor Dircetis, and her wond&#8217;rous fate. <br />
The Palestines believe it to a man, <br />
And show the lake, in which her scales began. <br />
Or if she rather should the daughter sing, <br />
Who in the hoary verge of life took wing; <br />
Who soar&#8217;d from Earth, and dwelt in tow&#8217;rs on high, <br />
And now a dove she flits along the sky. <br />
Or how lewd Nais, when her lust was cloy&#8217;d, <br />
To fishes turn&#8217;d the youths, she had enjoy&#8217;d, <br />
By pow&#8217;rful verse, and herbs; effect most strange! <br />
At last the changer shar&#8217;d herself the change. <br />
Or how the tree, which once white berries bore, <br />
Still crimson bears, since stain&#8217;d with crimson gore. <br />
The tree was new; she likes it, and begins <br />
To tell the tale, and as she tells, she spins.</p>
<p>The Story of Pyramus and Thisbe</p>
<p>In Babylon, where first her queen, for state <br />
Rais&#8217;d walls of brick magnificently great, <br />
Liv&#8217;d Pyramus, and Thisbe, lovely pair! <br />
He found no eastern youth his equal there, <br />
And she beyond the fairest nymph was fair. <br />
A closer neighbourhood was never known, <br />
Tho&#8217; two the houses, yet the roof was one. <br />
Acquaintance grew, th&#8217; acquaintance they improve <br />
To friendship, friendship ripen&#8217;d into love: <br />
Love had been crown&#8217;d, but impotently mad, <br />
What parents could not hinder, they forbad. <br />
For with fierce flames young Pyramus still burn&#8217;d, <br />
And grateful Thisbe flames as fierce return&#8217;d. <br />
Aloud in words their thoughts they dare not break, <br />
But silent stand; and silent looks can speak. <br />
The fire of love the more it is supprest, <br />
The more it glows, and rages in the breast.</p>
<p>When the division-wall was built, a chink <br />
Was left, the cement unobserv&#8217;d to shrink. <br />
So slight the cranny, that it still had been <br />
For centuries unclos&#8217;d, because unseen. <br />
But oh! what thing so small, so secret lies, <br />
Which scapes, if form&#8217;d for love, a lover&#8217;s eyes? <br />
Ev&#8217;n in this narrow chink they quickly found <br />
A friendly passage for a trackless sound. <br />
Safely they told their sorrows, and their joys, <br />
In whisper&#8217;d murmurs, and a dying noise, <br />
By turns to catch each other&#8217;s breath they strove, <br />
And suck&#8217;d in all the balmy breeze of love. <br />
Oft as on diff&#8217;rent sides they stood, they cry&#8217;d, <br />
Malicious wall, thus lovers to divide! <br />
Suppose, thou should&#8217;st a-while to us give place <br />
To lock, and fasten in a close embrace: <br />
But if too much to grant so sweet a bliss, <br />
Indulge at least the pleasure of a kiss. <br />
We scorn ingratitude: to thee, we know, <br />
This safe conveyance of our minds we owe.</p>
<p>Thus they their vain petition did renew <br />
&#8216;Till night, and then they softly sigh&#8217;d adieu. <br />
But first they strove to kiss, and that was all; <br />
Their kisses dy&#8217;d untasted on the wall. <br />
Soon as the morn had o&#8217;er the stars prevail&#8217;d, <br />
And warm&#8217;d by Phoebus, flow&#8217;rs their dews exhal&#8217;d, <br />
The lovers to their well-known place return, <br />
Alike they suffer, and alike they mourn. <br />
At last their parents they resolve to cheat <br />
(If to deceive in love be call&#8217;d deceit), <br />
To steal by night from home, and thence unknown <br />
To seek the fields, and quit th&#8217; unfaithful town. <br />
But, to prevent their wand&#8217;ring in the dark, <br />
They both agree to fix upon a mark; <br />
A mark, that could not their designs expose: <br />
The tomb of Ninus was the mark they chose. <br />
There they might rest secure beneath the shade, <br />
Which boughs, with snowy fruit encumber&#8217;d, made: <br />
A wide-spread mulberry its rise had took <br />
Just on the margin of a gurgling brook. <br />
Impatient for the friendly dusk they stay; <br />
And chide the slowness of departing day; <br />
In western seas down sunk at last the light, <br />
From western seas up-rose the shades of night. <br />
The loving Thisbe ev&#8217;n prevents the hour, <br />
With cautious silence she unlocks the door, <br />
And veils her face, and marching thro&#8217; the gloom <br />
Swiftly arrives at th&#8217; assignation-tomb. <br />
For still the fearful sex can fearless prove; <br />
Boldly they act, if spirited by love. <br />
When lo! a lioness rush&#8217;d o&#8217;er the plain, <br />
Grimly besmear&#8217;d with blood of oxen slain: <br />
And what to the dire sight new horrors brought, <br />
To slake her thirst the neighb&#8217;ring spring she sought. <br />
Which, by the moon, when trembling Thisbe spies, <br />
Wing&#8217;d with her fear, swift, as the wind, she flies; <br />
And in a cave recovers from her fright, <br />
But drop&#8217;d her veil, confounded in her flight. <br />
When sated with repeated draughts, again <br />
The queen of beasts scour&#8217;d back along the plain, <br />
She found the veil, and mouthing it all o&#8217;er, <br />
With bloody jaws the lifeless prey she tore.</p>
<p>The youth, who could not cheat his guards so soon, <br />
Late came, and noted by the glimm&#8217;ring moon <br />
Some savage feet, new printed on the ground, <br />
His cheeks turn&#8217;d pale, his limbs no vigour found; <br />
But when, advancing on, the veil he spied <br />
Distain&#8217;d with blood, and ghastly torn, he cried, <br />
One night shall death to two young lovers give, <br />
But she deserv&#8217;d unnumber&#8217;d years to live! <br />
&#8216;Tis I am guilty, I have thee betray&#8217;d, <br />
Who came not early, as my charming maid. <br />
Whatever slew thee, I the cause remain, <br />
I nam&#8217;d, and fix&#8217;d the place where thou wast slain. <br />
Ye lions from your neighb&#8217;ring dens repair, <br />
Pity the wretch, this impious body tear! <br />
But cowards thus for death can idly cry; <br />
The brave still have it in their pow&#8217;r to die. <br />
Then to th&#8217; appointed tree he hastes away, <br />
The veil first gather&#8217;d, tho&#8217; all rent it lay: <br />
The veil all rent yet still it self endears, <br />
He kist, and kissing, wash&#8217;d it with his tears. <br />
Tho&#8217; rich (he cry&#8217;d) with many a precious stain, <br />
Still from my blood a deeper tincture gain. <br />
Then in his breast his shining sword he drown&#8217;d, <br />
And fell supine, extended on the ground. <br />
As out again the blade lie dying drew, <br />
Out spun the blood, and streaming upwards flew. <br />
So if a conduit-pipe e&#8217;er burst you saw, <br />
Swift spring the gushing waters thro&#8217; the flaw: <br />
Then spouting in a bow, they rise on high, <br />
And a new fountain plays amid the sky. <br />
The berries, stain&#8217;d with blood, began to show <br />
A dark complexion, and forgot their snow; <br />
While fatten&#8217;d with the flowing gore, the root <br />
Was doom&#8217;d for ever to a purple fruit.</p>
<p>Mean-time poor Thisbe fear&#8217;d, so long she stay&#8217;d, <br />
Her lover might suspect a perjur&#8217;d maid. <br />
Her fright scarce o&#8217;er, she strove the youth to find <br />
With ardent eyes, which spoke an ardent mind. <br />
Already in his arms, she hears him sigh <br />
At her destruction, which was once so nigh. <br />
The tomb, the tree, but not the fruit she knew, <br />
The fruit she doubted for its alter&#8217;d hue. <br />
Still as she doubts, her eyes a body found <br />
Quiv&#8217;ring in death, and gasping on the ground. <br />
She started back, the red her cheeks forsook, <br />
And ev&#8217;ry nerve with thrilling horrors shook. <br />
So trembles the smooth surface of the seas, <br />
If brush&#8217;d o&#8217;er gently with a rising breeze. <br />
But when her view her bleeding love confest, <br />
She shriek&#8217;d, she tore her hair, she beat her breast. <br />
She rais&#8217;d the body, and embrac&#8217;d it round, <br />
And bath&#8217;d with tears unfeign&#8217;d the gaping wound. <br />
Then her warm lips to the cold face apply&#8217;d, <br />
And is it thus, ah! thus we meet, she cry&#8217;d! <br />
My Pyramus! whence sprung thy cruel fate? <br />
My Pyramus!- ah! speak, ere &#8217;tis too late. <br />
I, thy own Thisbe, but one word implore, <br />
One word thy Thisbe never ask&#8217;d before. <br />
At Thisbe&#8217;s name, awak&#8217;d, he open&#8217;d wide <br />
His dying eyes; with dying eyes he try&#8217;d <br />
On her to dwell, but clos&#8217;d them slow, and dy&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The fatal cause was now at last explor&#8217;d, <br />
Her veil she knew, and saw his sheathless sword: <br />
From thy own hand thy ruin thou hast found, <br />
She said, but love first taught that hand to wound, <br />
Ev&#8217;n I for thee as bold a hand can show, <br />
And love, which shall as true direct the blow. <br />
I will against the woman&#8217;s weakness strive, <br />
And never thee, lamented youth, survive. <br />
The world may say, I caus&#8217;d, alas! thy death, <br />
But saw thee breathless, and resign&#8217;d my breath. <br />
Fate, tho&#8217; it conquers, shall no triumph gain, <br />
Fate, that divides us, still divides in vain.</p>
<p>Now, both our cruel parents, hear my pray&#8217;r; <br />
My pray&#8217;r to offer for us both I dare; <br />
Oh! see our ashes in one urn confin&#8217;d, <br />
Whom love at first, and fate at last has join&#8217;d. <br />
The bliss, you envy&#8217;d, is not our request; <br />
Lovers, when dead, may sure together rest. <br />
Thou, tree, where now one lifeless lump is laid, <br />
Ere-long o&#8217;er two shalt cast a friendly shade. <br />
Still let our loves from thee be understood, <br />
Still witness in thy purple fruit our blood. <br />
She spoke, and in her bosom plung&#8217;d the sword, <br />
All warm and reeking from its slaughter&#8217;d lord. <br />
The pray&#8217;r, which dying Thisbe had preferr&#8217;d, <br />
Both Gods, and parents, with compassion heard. <br />
The whiteness of the mulberry soon fled, <br />
And rip&#8217;ning, sadden&#8217;d in a dusky red: <br />
While both their parents their lost children mourn, <br />
And mix their ashes in one golden urn.</p>
<p>Thus did the melancholy tale conclude, <br />
And a short, silent interval ensu&#8217;d. <br />
The next in birth unloos&#8217;d her artful tongue, <br />
And drew attentive all the sister-throng.</p>
<p>The Story of Leucothoe and the Sun</p>
<p>The Sun, the source of light, by beauty&#8217;s pow&#8217;r <br />
Once am&#8217;rous grew; then hear the Sun&#8217;s amour. <br />
Venus, and Mars, with his far-piercing eyes <br />
This God first spy&#8217;d; this God first all things spies. <br />
Stung at the sight, and swift on mischief bent, <br />
To haughty Juno&#8217;s shapeless son he went: <br />
The Goddess, and her God gallant betray&#8217;d, <br />
And told the cuckold, where their pranks were play&#8217;d. <br />
Poor Vulcan soon desir&#8217;d to hear no more, <br />
He drop&#8217;d his hammer, and he shook all o&#8217;er: <br />
Then courage takes, and full of vengeful ire <br />
He heaves the bellows, and blows fierce the fire: <br />
From liquid brass, tho&#8217; sure, yet subtile snares <br />
He forms, and next a wond&#8217;rous net prepares, <br />
Drawn with such curious art, so nicely sly, <br />
Unseen the mashes cheat the searching eye. <br />
Not half so thin their webs the spiders weave, <br />
Which the most wary, buzzing prey deceive. <br />
These chains, obedient to the touch, he spread <br />
In secret foldings o&#8217;er the conscious bed: <br />
The conscious bed again was quickly prest <br />
By the fond pair, in lawless raptures blest. <br />
Mars wonder&#8217;d at his Cytherea&#8217;s charms, <br />
More fast than ever lock&#8217;d within her arms. <br />
While Vulcan th&#8217; iv&#8217;ry doors unbarr&#8217;d with care, <br />
Then call&#8217;d the Gods to view the sportive pair: <br />
The Gods throng&#8217;d in, and saw in open day, <br />
Where Mars, and beauty&#8217;s queen, all naked, lay. <br />
O! shameful sight, if shameful that we name, <br />
Which Gods with envy view&#8217;d, and could not blame; <br />
But, for the pleasure, wish&#8217;d to bear the shame. <br />
Each Deity, with laughter tir&#8217;d, departs, <br />
Yet all still laugh&#8217;d at Vulcan in their hearts.</p>
<p>Thro&#8217; Heav&#8217;n the news of this surprizal run, <br />
But Venus did not thus forget the Sun. <br />
He, who stol&#8217;n transports idly had betray&#8217;d, <br />
By a betrayer was in kind repay&#8217;d. <br />
What now avails, great God, thy piercing blaze, <br />
That youth, and beauty, and those golden rays? <br />
Thou, who can&#8217;st warm this universe alone, <br />
Feel&#8217;st now a warmth more pow&#8217;rful than thy own: <br />
And those bright eyes, which all things should survey, <br />
Know not from fair Leucothoe to stray. <br />
The lamp of light, for human good design&#8217;d, <br />
Is to one virgin niggardly confin&#8217;d. <br />
Sometimes too early rise thy eastern beams, <br />
Sometimes too late they set in western streams: <br />
&#8216;Tis then her beauty thy swift course delays, <br />
And gives to winter skies long summer days. <br />
Now in thy face thy love-sick mind appears, <br />
And spreads thro&#8217; impious nations empty fears: <br />
For when thy beamless head is wrapt in night, <br />
Poor mortals tremble in despair of light. <br />
&#8216;Tis not the moon, that o&#8217;er thee casts a veil <br />
&#8216;Tis love alone, which makes thy looks so pale. <br />
Leucothoe is grown thy only care, <br />
Not Phaeton&#8217;s fair mother now is fair. <br />
The youthful Rhodos moves no tender thought, <br />
And beauteous Porsa is at last forgot. <br />
Fond Clytie, scorn&#8217;d, yet lov&#8217;d, and sought thy bed, <br />
Ev&#8217;n then thy heart for other virgins bled. <br />
Leucothoe has all thy soul possest, <br />
And chas&#8217;d each rival passion from thy breast. <br />
To this bright nymph Eurynome gave birth <br />
In the blest confines of the spicy Earth. <br />
Excelling others, she herself beheld <br />
By her own blooming daughter far excell&#8217;d. <br />
The sire was Orchamus, whose vast command, <br />
The sev&#8217;nth from Belus, rul&#8217;d the Persian Land.</p>
<p>Deep in cool vales, beneath th&#8217; Hesperian sky, <br />
For the Sun&#8217;s fiery steeds the pastures lye. <br />
Ambrosia there they eat, and thence they gain <br />
New vigour, and their daily toils sustain. <br />
While thus on heav&#8217;nly food the coursers fed, <br />
And night, around, her gloomy empire spread, <br />
The God assum&#8217;d the mother&#8217;s shape and air, <br />
And pass&#8217;d, unheeded, to his darling fair. <br />
Close by a lamp, with maids encompass&#8217;d round, <br />
The royal spinster, full employ&#8217;d, he found: <br />
Then cry&#8217;d, A-while from work, my daughter, rest; <br />
And, like a mother, scarce her lips he prest. <br />
Servants retire!- nor secrets dare to hear, <br />
Intrusted only to a daughter&#8217;s ear. <br />
They swift obey&#8217;d: not one, suspicious, thought <br />
The secret, which their mistress would be taught. <br />
Then he: since now no witnesses are near, <br />
Behold! the God, who guides the various year! <br />
The world&#8217;s vast eye, of light the source serene, <br />
Who all things sees, by whom are all things seen. <br />
Believe me, nymph! (for I the truth have show&#8217;d) <br />
Thy charms have pow&#8217;r to charm so great a God. <br />
Confus&#8217;d, she heard him his soft passion tell, <br />
And on the floor, untwirl&#8217;d, the spindle fell: <br />
Still from the sweet confusion some new grace <br />
Blush&#8217;d out by stealth, and languish&#8217;d in her face. <br />
The lover, now inflam&#8217;d, himself put on, <br />
And out at once the God, all-radiant, shone. <br />
The virgin startled at his alter&#8217;d form, <br />
Too weak to bear a God&#8217;s impetuous storm: <br />
No more against the dazling youth she strove, <br />
But silent yielded, and indulg&#8217;d his love.</p>
<p>This Clytie knew, and knew she was undone, <br />
Whose soul was fix&#8217;d, and doated on the Sun. <br />
She rag&#8217;d to think on her neglected charms, <br />
And Phoebus, panting in another&#8217;s arms. <br />
With envious madness fir&#8217;d, she flies in haste, <br />
And tells the king, his daughter was unchaste. <br />
The king, incens&#8217;d to hear his honour stain&#8217;d, <br />
No more the father nor the man retain&#8217;d. <br />
In vain she stretch&#8217;d her arms, and turn&#8217;d her eyes <br />
To her lov&#8217;d God, th&#8217; enlightner of the skies. <br />
In vain she own&#8217;d it was a crime, yet still <br />
It was a crime not acted by her will. <br />
The brutal sire stood deaf to ev&#8217;ry pray&#8217;r, <br />
And deep in Earth entomb&#8217;d alive the fair. <br />
What Phoebus could do, was by Phoebus done: <br />
Full on her grave with pointed beams he shone: <br />
To pointed beams the gaping Earth gave way; <br />
Had the nymph eyes, her eyes had seen the day, <br />
But lifeless now, yet lovely still, she lay. <br />
Not more the God wept, when the world was fir&#8217;d, <br />
And in the wreck his blooming boy expir&#8217;d. <br />
The vital flame he strives to light again, <br />
And warm the frozen blood in ev&#8217;ry vein: <br />
But since resistless Fates deny&#8217;d that pow&#8217;r, <br />
On the cold nymph he rain&#8217;d a nectar show&#8217;r. <br />
Ah! undeserving thus (he said) to die, <br />
Yet still in odours thou shalt reach the sky. <br />
The body soon dissolv&#8217;d, and all around <br />
Perfum&#8217;d with heav&#8217;nly fragrancies the ground, <br />
A sacrifice for Gods up-rose from thence, <br />
A sweet, delightful tree of frankincense.</p>
<p>The Transformation of Clytie</p>
<p>Tho&#8217; guilty Clytie thus the sun betray&#8217;d, <br />
By too much passion she was guilty made. <br />
Excess of love begot excess of grief, <br />
Grief fondly bad her hence to hope relief. <br />
But angry Phoebus hears, unmov&#8217;d, her sighs, <br />
And scornful from her loath&#8217;d embraces flies. <br />
All day, all night, in trackless wilds, alone <br />
She pin&#8217;d, and taught the list&#8217;ning rocks her moan. <br />
On the bare earth she lies, her bosom bare, <br />
Loose her attire, dishevel&#8217;d is her hair. <br />
Nine times the morn unbarr&#8217;d the gates of light, <br />
As oft were spread th&#8217; alternate shades of night, <br />
So long no sustenance the mourner knew, <br />
Unless she drunk her tears, or suck&#8217;d the dew. <br />
She turn&#8217;d about, but rose not from the ground, <br />
Turn&#8217;d to the Sun, still as he roul&#8217;d his round: <br />
On his bright face hung her desiring eyes, <br />
&#8216;Till fix&#8217;d to Earth, she strove in vain to rise. <br />
Her looks their paleness in a flow&#8217;r retain&#8217;d, <br />
But here, and there, some purple streaks they gain&#8217;d. <br />
Still the lov&#8217;d object the fond leafs pursue, <br />
Still move their root, the moving Sun to view, <br />
And in the Heliotrope the nymph is true.</p>
<p>The sisters heard these wonders with surprise, <br />
But part receiv&#8217;d them as romantick lies; <br />
And pertly rally&#8217;d, that they could not see <br />
In Pow&#8217;rs divine so vast an energy. <br />
Part own&#8217;d, true Gods such miracles might do, <br />
But own&#8217;d not Bacchus, one among the true. <br />
At last a common, just request they make, <br />
And beg Alcithoe her turn to take. <br />
I will (she said) and please you, if I can. <br />
Then shot her shuttle swift, and thus began.</p>
<p>The fate of Daphnis is a fate too known, <br />
Whom an enamour&#8217;d nymph transform&#8217;d to stone, <br />
Because she fear&#8217;d another nymph might see <br />
The lovely youth, and love as much as she: <br />
So strange the madness is of jealousie! <br />
Nor shall I tell, what changes Scython made, <br />
And how he walk&#8217;d a man, or tripp&#8217;d a maid. <br />
You too would peevish frown, and patience want <br />
To hear, how Celmis grew an adamant. <br />
He once was dear to Jove, and saw of old <br />
Jove, when a child; but what he saw, he told. <br />
Crocus, and Smilax may be turn&#8217;d to flow&#8217;rs, <br />
And the Curetes spring from bounteous show&#8217;rs; <br />
I pass a hundred legends stale, as these, <br />
And with sweet novelty your taste will please.</p>
<p>The Story of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus</p>
<p>How Salmacis, with weak enfeebling streams <br />
Softens the body, and unnerves the limbs, <br />
And what the secret cause, shall here be shown; <br />
The cause is secret, but th&#8217; effect is known.</p>
<p>The Naids nurst an infant heretofore, <br />
That Cytherea once to Hermes bore: <br />
From both th&#8217; illustrious authors of his race <br />
The child was nam&#8217;d, nor was it hard to trace <br />
Both the bright parents thro&#8217; the infant&#8217;s face. <br />
When fifteen years in Ida&#8217;s cool retreat <br />
The boy had told, he left his native seat, <br />
And sought fresh fountains in a foreign soil: <br />
The pleasure lessen&#8217;d the attending toil, <br />
With eager steps the Lycian fields he crost, <br />
A river here he view&#8217;d so lovely bright, <br />
It shew&#8217;d the bottom in a fairer light, <br />
Nor kept a sand conceal&#8217;d from human sight. <br />
The stream produc&#8217;d nor slimy ooze, nor weeds, <br />
Nor miry rushes, nor the spiky reeds; <br />
But dealt enriching moisture all around, <br />
The fruitful banks with chearful verdure crown&#8217;d, <br />
And kept the spring eternal on the ground. <br />
A nymph presides, not practis&#8217;d in the chace, <br />
Nor skilful at the bow, nor at the race; <br />
Of all the blue-ey&#8217;d daughters of the main, <br />
The only stranger to Diana&#8217;s train: <br />
Her sisters often, as &#8217;tis said, wou&#8217;d cry, <br />
&#8220;Fie Salmacis: what, always idle! fie. <br />
Or take thy quiver, or thy arrows seize, <br />
And mix the toils of hunting with thy ease.&#8221; <br />
Nor quiver she nor arrows e&#8217;er wou&#8217;d seize, <br />
Nor mix the toils of hunting with her ease. <br />
But oft would bathe her in the chrystal tide, <br />
Oft with a comb her dewy locks divide; <br />
Now in the limpid streams she views her face, <br />
And drest her image in the floating glass: <br />
On beds of leaves she now repos&#8217;d her limbs, <br />
Now gather&#8217;d flow&#8217;rs that grew about her streams, <br />
And then by chance was gathering, as he stood <br />
To view the boy, and long&#8217;d for what she view&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Fain wou&#8217;d she meet the youth with hasty feet, <br />
She fain wou&#8217;d meet him, but refus&#8217;d to meet <br />
Before her looks were set with nicest care, <br />
And well deserv&#8217;d to be reputed fair. <br />
&#8220;Bright youth,&#8221; she cries, &#8220;whom all thy features prove <br />
A God, and, if a God, the God of love; <br />
But if a mortal, blest thy nurse&#8217;s breast, <br />
Blest are thy parents, and thy sisters blest: <br />
But oh how blest! how more than blest thy bride, <br />
Ally&#8217;d in bliss, if any yet ally&#8217;d. <br />
If so, let mine the stoln enjoyments be; <br />
If not, behold a willing bride in me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy knew nought of love, and toucht with shame, <br />
He strove, and blusht, but still the blush became: <br />
In rising blushes still fresh beauties rose; <br />
The sunny side of fruit such blushes shows, <br />
And such the moon, when all her silver white <br />
Turns in eclipses to a ruddy light. <br />
The nymph still begs, if not a nobler bliss, <br />
A cold salute at least, a sister&#8217;s kiss: <br />
And now prepares to take the lovely boy <br />
Between her arms. He, innocently coy, <br />
Replies, &#8220;Or leave me to my self alone, <br />
You rude uncivil nymph, or I&#8217;ll be gone.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Fair stranger then,&#8221; says she, &#8220;it shall be so&#8221;; <br />
And, for she fear&#8217;d his threats, she feign&#8217;d to go: <br />
But hid within a covert&#8217;s neighbouring green, <br />
She kept him still in sight, herself unseen. <br />
The boy now fancies all the danger o&#8217;er, <br />
And innocently sports about the shore, <br />
Playful and wanton to the stream he trips, <br />
And dips his foot, and shivers as he dips. <br />
The coolness pleas&#8217;d him, and with eager haste <br />
His airy garments on the banks he cast; <br />
His godlike features, and his heav&#8217;nly hue, <br />
And all his beauties were expos&#8217;d to view. <br />
His naked limbs the nymph with rapture spies, <br />
While hotter passions in her bosom rise, <br />
Flush in her cheeks, and sparkle in her eyes. <br />
She longs, she burns to clasp him in her arms, <br />
And looks, and sighs, and kindles at his charms.</p>
<p>Now all undrest upon the banks he stood, <br />
And clapt his sides, and leapt into the flood: <br />
His lovely limbs the silver waves divide, <br />
His limbs appear more lovely through the tide; <br />
As lillies shut within a chrystal case, <br />
Receive a glossy lustre from the glass. <br />
He&#8217;s mine, he&#8217;s all my own, the Naid cries, <br />
And flings off all, and after him she flies. <br />
And now she fastens on him as he swims, <br />
And holds him close, and wraps about his limbs. <br />
The more the boy resisted, and was coy, <br />
The more she clipt, and kist the strugling boy. <br />
So when the wrigling snake is snatcht on high <br />
In Eagle&#8217;s claws, and hisses in the sky, <br />
Around the foe his twirling tail he flings, <br />
And twists her legs, and wriths about her wings.</p>
<p>The restless boy still obstinately strove <br />
To free himself, and still refus&#8217;d her love. <br />
Amidst his limbs she kept her limbs intwin&#8217;d, <br />
&#8220;And why, coy youth,&#8221; she cries, &#8220;why thus unkind! <br />
Oh may the Gods thus keep us ever join&#8217;d! <br />
Oh may we never, never part again!&#8221;</p>
<p>So pray&#8217;d the nymph, nor did she pray in vain: <br />
For now she finds him, as his limbs she prest, <br />
Grow nearer still, and nearer to her breast; <br />
&#8216;Till, piercing each the other&#8217;s flesh, they run <br />
Together, and incorporate in one: <br />
Last in one face are both their faces join&#8217;d, <br />
As when the stock and grafted twig combin&#8217;d <br />
Shoot up the same, and wear a common rind: <br />
Both bodies in a single body mix, <br />
A single body with a double sex.</p>
<p>The boy, thus lost in woman, now survey&#8217;d <br />
The river&#8217;s guilty stream, and thus he pray&#8217;d. <br />
(He pray&#8217;d, but wonder&#8217;d at his softer tone, <br />
Surpriz&#8217;d to hear a voice but half his own.) <br />
You parent-Gods, whose heav&#8217;nly names I bear, <br />
Hear your Hermaphrodite, and grant my pray&#8217;r; <br />
Oh grant, that whomsoe&#8217;er these streams contain, <br />
If man he enter&#8217;d, he may rise again <br />
Supple, unsinew&#8217;d, and but half a man!</p>
<p>The heav&#8217;nly parents answer&#8217;d from on high, <br />
Their two-shap&#8217;d son, the double votary <br />
Then gave a secret virtue to the flood, <br />
And ting&#8217;d its source to make his wishes good.</p>
<p>Alcithoe and her Sisters transform&#8217;d to Bats</p>
<p>But Mineus&#8217; daughters still their tasks pursue, <br />
To wickedness most obstinately true: <br />
At Bacchus still they laugh, when all around, <br />
Unseen, the timbrels hoarse were heard to sound. <br />
Saffron and myrrh their fragrant odours shed, <br />
And now the present deity they dread. <br />
Strange to relate! Here ivy first was seen, <br />
Along the distaff crept the wond&#8217;rous green. <br />
Then sudden-springing vines began to bloom, <br />
And the soft tendrils curl&#8217;d around the loom: <br />
While purple clusters, dangling from on high, <br />
Ting&#8217;d the wrought purple with a second die.</p>
<p>Now from the skies was shot a doubtful light, <br />
The day declining to the bounds of night. <br />
The fabrick&#8217;s firm foundations shake all o&#8217;er, <br />
False tigers rage, and figur&#8217;d lions roar. <br />
Torches, aloft, seem blazing in the air, <br />
And angry flashes of red light&#8217;nings glare. <br />
To dark recesses, the dire sight to shun, <br />
Swift the pale sisters in confusion run. <br />
Their arms were lost in pinions, as they fled, <br />
And subtle films each slender limb o&#8217;er-spread. <br />
Their alter&#8217;d forms their senses soon reveal&#8217;d; <br />
Their forms, how alter&#8217;d, darkness still conceal&#8217;d. <br />
Close to the roof each, wond&#8217;ring, upwards springs, <br />
Born on unknown, transparent, plumeless wings. <br />
They strove for words; their little bodies found <br />
No words, but murmur&#8217;d in a fainting sound. <br />
In towns, not woods, the sooty bats delight, <br />
And, never, &#8217;till the dusk, begin their flight; <br />
&#8216;Till Vesper rises with his ev&#8217;ning flame; <br />
From whom the Romans have deriv&#8217;d their name.</p>
<p>The Transformation of Ino and Melicerta to Sea-Gods</p>
<p>The pow&#8217;r of Bacchus now o&#8217;er Thebes had flown: <br />
With awful rev&#8217;rence soon the God they own. <br />
Proud Ino, all around the wonder tells, <br />
And on her nephew deity still dwells. <br />
Of num&#8217;rous sisters, she alone yet knew <br />
No grief, but grief, which she from sisters drew.</p>
<p>Imperial Juno saw her with disdain, <br />
Vain in her offspring, in her consort vain, <br />
Who rul&#8217;d the trembling Thebans with a nod, <br />
But saw her vainest in her foster-God. <br />
Could then (she cry&#8217;d) a bastard-boy have pow&#8217;r <br />
To make a mother her own son devour? <br />
Could he the Tuscan crew to fishes change, <br />
And now three sisters damn to forms so strange? <br />
Yet shall the wife of Jove find no relief? <br />
Shall she, still unreveng&#8217;d, disclose her grief? <br />
Have I the mighty freedom to complain? <br />
Is that my pow&#8217;r? is that to ease my pain? <br />
A foe has taught me vengeance; and who ought <br />
To scorn that vengeance, which a foe has taught? <br />
What sure destruction frantick rage can throw, <br />
The gaping wounds of slaughter&#8217;d Pentheus show. <br />
Why should not Ino, fir&#8217;d with madness, stray, <br />
Like her mad sisters her own kindred slay? <br />
Why, she not follow, where they lead the way?</p>
<p>Down a steep, yawning cave, where yews display&#8217;d <br />
In arches meet, and lend a baleful shade, <br />
Thro&#8217; silent labyrinths a passage lies <br />
To mournful regions, and infernal skies. <br />
Here Styx exhales its noisome clouds, and here, <br />
The fun&#8217;ral rites once paid, all souls appear. <br />
Stiff cold, and horror with a ghastly face <br />
And staring eyes, infest the dreary place. <br />
Ghosts, new-arriv&#8217;d, and strangers to these plains, <br />
Know not the palace, where grim Pluto reigns. <br />
They journey doubtful, nor the road can tell, <br />
Which leads to the metropolis of Hell. <br />
A thousand avenues those tow&#8217;rs command, <br />
A thousand gates for ever open stand. <br />
As all the rivers, disembogu&#8217;d, find room <br />
For all their waters in old Ocean&#8217;s womb: <br />
So this vast city worlds of shades receives, <br />
And space for millions still of worlds she leaves. <br />
Th&#8217; unbody&#8217;d spectres freely rove, and show <br />
Whate&#8217;er they lov&#8217;d on Earth, they love below. <br />
The lawyers still, or right, or wrong, support, <br />
The courtiers smoothly glide to Pluto&#8217;s court. <br />
Still airy heroes thoughts of glory fire, <br />
Still the dead poet strings his deathless lyre, <br />
And lovers still with fancy&#8217;d darts expire.</p>
<p>The Queen of Heaven, to gratify her hate, <br />
And sooth immortal wrath, forgets her state. <br />
Down from the realms of day, to realms of night, <br />
The Goddess swift precipitates her flight. <br />
At Hell arriv&#8217;d, the noise Hell&#8217;s porter heard, <br />
Th&#8217; enormous dog his triple head up-rear&#8217;d: <br />
Thrice from three grizly throats he howl&#8217;d profound, <br />
Then suppliant couch&#8217;d, and stretch&#8217;d along the ground. <br />
The trembling threshold, which Saturnia prest, <br />
The weight of such divinity confest.</p>
<p>Before a lofty, adamantine gate, <br />
Which clos&#8217;d a tow&#8217;r of brass, the Furies sate: <br />
Mis-shapen forms, tremendous to the sight, <br />
Th&#8217; implacable foul daughters of the night. <br />
A sounding whip each bloody sister shakes, <br />
Or from her tresses combs the curling snakes. <br />
But now great Juno&#8217;s majesty was known; <br />
Thro&#8217; the thick gloom, all heav&#8217;nly bright, she shone: <br />
The hideous monsters their obedience show&#8217;d, <br />
And rising from their seats, submissive bow&#8217;d.</p>
<p>This is the place of woe, here groan the dead; <br />
Huge Tityus o&#8217;er nine acres here is spread. <br />
Fruitful for pain th&#8217; immortal liver breeds, <br />
Still grows, and still th&#8217; insatiate vulture feeds. <br />
Poor Tantalus to taste the water tries, <br />
But from his lips the faithless water flies: <br />
Then thinks the bending tree he can command, <br />
The tree starts backwards, and eludes his hand. <br />
The labour too of Sisyphus is vain, <br />
Up the steep mount he heaves the stone with pain, <br />
Down from the summet rouls the stone again. <br />
The Belides their leaky vessels still <br />
Are ever filling, and yet never fill: <br />
Doom&#8217;d to this punishment for blood they shed, <br />
For bridegrooms slaughter&#8217;d in the bridal bed. <br />
Stretch&#8217;d on the rolling wheel Ixion lies; <br />
Himself he follows, and himself he flies. <br />
Ixion, tortur&#8217;d, Juno sternly ey&#8217;d, <br />
Then turn&#8217;d, and toiling Sisyphus espy&#8217;d: <br />
And why (she said) so wretched is the fate <br />
Of him, whose brother proudly reigns in state? <br />
Yet still my altars unador&#8217;d have been <br />
By Athamas, and his presumptuous queen.</p>
<p>What caus&#8217;d her hate, the Goddess thus confest, <br />
What caus&#8217;d her journey now was more than guest. <br />
That hate, relentless, its revenge did want, <br />
And that revenge the Furies soon could grant: <br />
They could the glory of proud Thebes efface, <br />
And hide in ruin the Cadmean race. <br />
For this she largely promises, entreats, <br />
And to intreaties adds imperial threats.</p>
<p>Then fell Tisiphone with rage was stung, <br />
And from her mouth th&#8217; untwisted serpents flung. <br />
To gain this trifling boon, there is no need <br />
(She cry&#8217;d) in formal speeches to proceed. <br />
Whatever thou command&#8217;st to do, is done; <br />
Believe it finish&#8217;d, tho&#8217; not yet begun. <br />
But from these melancholly seats repair <br />
To happier mansions, and to purer air. <br />
She spoke: the Goddess, darting upwards, flies, <br />
And joyous re-ascends her native skies: <br />
Nor enter&#8217;d there, till &#8217;round her Iris threw <br />
Ambrosial sweets, and pour&#8217;d celestial dew.</p>
<p>The faithful Fury, guiltless of delays, <br />
With cruel haste the dire command obeys. <br />
Girt in a bloody gown, a torch she shakes, <br />
And round her neck twines speckled wreaths of snakes. <br />
Fear, and dismay, and agonizing pain, <br />
With frantick rage, compleat her loveless train. <br />
To Thebes her flight she sped, and Hell forsook; <br />
At her approach the Theban turrets shook: <br />
The sun shrunk back, thick clouds the day o&#8217;er-cast, <br />
And springing greens were wither&#8217;d as she past.</p>
<p>Now, dismal yellings heard, strange spectres seen, <br />
Confound as much the monarch as the queen. <br />
In vain to quit the palace they prepar&#8217;d, <br />
Tisiphone was there, and kept the ward. <br />
She wide extended her unfriendly arms, <br />
And all the Fury lavish&#8217;d all her harms. <br />
Part of her tresses loudly hiss, and part <br />
Spread poyson, as their forky tongues they dart. <br />
Then from her middle locks two snakes she drew, <br />
Whose merit from superior mischief grew: <br />
Th&#8217; envenom&#8217;d ruin, thrown with spiteful care, <br />
Clung to the bosoms of the hapless pair. <br />
The hapless pair soon with wild thoughts were fir&#8217;d, <br />
And madness, by a thousand ways inspir&#8217;d. <br />
&#8216;Tis true, th&#8217; unwounded body still was sound, <br />
But &#8217;twas the soul which felt the deadly wound. <br />
Nor did th&#8217; unsated monster here give o&#8217;er, <br />
But dealt of plagues a fresh, unnumber&#8217;d store. <br />
Each baneful juice too well she understood, <br />
Foam, churn&#8217;d by Cerberus, and Hydra&#8217;s blood. <br />
Hot hemlock, and cold aconite she chose, <br />
Delighted in variety of woes. <br />
Whatever can untune th&#8217; harmonious soul, <br />
And its mild, reas&#8217;ning faculties controul, <br />
Give false ideas, raise desires profane, <br />
And whirl in eddies the tumultuous brain, <br />
Mix&#8217;d with curs&#8217;d art, she direfully around <br />
Thro&#8217; all their nerves diffus&#8217;d the sad compound. <br />
Then toss&#8217;d her torch in circles still the same, <br />
Improv&#8217;d their rage, and added flame to flame. <br />
The grinning Fury her own conquest spy&#8217;d, <br />
And to her rueful shades return&#8217;d with pride, <br />
And threw th&#8217; exhausted, useless snakes aside.</p>
<p>Now Athamas cries out, his reason fled, <br />
Here, fellow-hunters, let the toils be spread. <br />
I saw a lioness, in quest of food, <br />
With her two young, run roaring in this wood. <br />
Again the fancy&#8217;d savages were seen, <br />
As thro&#8217; his palace still he chac&#8217;d his queen; <br />
Then tore Learchus from her breast: the child <br />
Stretch&#8217;d little arms, and on its father smil&#8217;d: <br />
A father now no more, who now begun <br />
Around his head to whirl his giddy son, <br />
And, quite insensible to Nature&#8217;s call, <br />
The helpless infant flung against the wall. <br />
The same mad poyson in the mother wrought, <br />
Young Melicerta in her arms she caught, <br />
And with disorder&#8217;d tresses, howling, flies, <br />
O! Bacchus, Evoe, Bacchus! loud she cries. <br />
The name of Bacchus Juno laugh&#8217;d to hear, <br />
And said, Thy foster-God has cost thee dear.</p>
<p>A rock there stood, whose side the beating waves <br />
Had long consum&#8217;d, and hollow&#8217;d into caves. <br />
The head shot forwards in a bending steep, <br />
And cast a dreadful covert o&#8217;er the deep. <br />
The wretched Ino, on destruction bent, <br />
Climb&#8217;d up the cliff; such strength her fury lent: <br />
Thence with her guiltless boy, who wept in vain, <br />
At one bold spring she plung&#8217;d into the main.</p>
<p>Her neice&#8217;s fate touch&#8217;d Cytherea&#8217;s breast, <br />
And in soft sounds she Neptune thus addrest: <br />
Great God of waters, whose extended sway <br />
Is next to his, whom Heav&#8217;n and Earth obey: <br />
Let not the suit of Venus thee displease, <br />
Pity the floaters on th&#8217; Ionian seas. <br />
Encrease thy Subject-Gods, nor yet disdain <br />
To add my kindred to that glorious train. <br />
If from the sea I may such honours claim, <br />
If &#8217;tis desert, that from the sea I came, <br />
As Grecian poets artfully have sung, <br />
And in the name confest, from whence I sprung.</p>
<p>Pleas&#8217;d Neptune nodded his assent, and free <br />
Both soon became from frail mortality. <br />
He gave them form, and majesty divine, <br />
And bad them glide along the foamy brine. <br />
For Melicerta is Palaemon known, <br />
And Ino once, Leucothoe is grown.</p>
<p>The Transformation of the Theban Matrons</p>
<p>The Theban matrons their lov&#8217;d queen pursu&#8217;d, <br />
And tracing to the rock, her footsteps view&#8217;d. <br />
Too certain of her fate, they rend the skies <br />
With piteous shrieks, and lamentable cries. <br />
All beat their breasts, and Juno all upbraid, <br />
Who still remember&#8217;d a deluded maid: <br />
Who, still revengeful for one stol&#8217;n embrace, <br />
Thus wreak&#8217;d her hate on the Cadmean race. <br />
This Juno heard: And shall such elfs, she cry&#8217;d, <br />
Dispute my justice, or my pow&#8217;r deride? <br />
You too shall feel my wrath not idly spent; <br />
A Goddess never for insults was meant.</p>
<p>She, who lov&#8217;d most, and who most lov&#8217;d had been, <br />
Said, Not the waves shall part me from my queen. <br />
She strove to plunge into the roaring flood; <br />
Fix&#8217;d to the stone, a stone her self she stood. <br />
This, on her breast would fain her blows repeat, <br />
Her stiffen&#8217;d hands refus&#8217;d her breast to beat. <br />
That, stretch&#8217;d her arms unto the seas; in vain <br />
Her arms she labour&#8217;d to unstretch again. <br />
To tear her comely locks another try&#8217;d, <br />
Both comely locks, and fingers petryfi&#8217;d. <br />
Part thus; but Juno with a softer mind <br />
Part doom&#8217;d to mix among the feather&#8217;d kind. <br />
Transform&#8217;d, the name of Theban birds they keep, <br />
And skim the surface of that fatal deep.</p>
<p>Cadmus and his Queen transform&#8217;d to Serpents</p>
<p>Mean-time, the wretched Cadmus mourns, nor knows, <br />
That they who mortal fell, immortal rose. <br />
With a long series of new ills opprest, <br />
He droops, and all the man forsakes his breast. <br />
Strange prodigies confound his frighted eyes; <br />
From the fair city, which he rais&#8217;d, he flies: <br />
As if misfortune not pursu&#8217;d his race, <br />
But only hung o&#8217;er that devoted place. <br />
Resolv&#8217;d by sea to seek some distant land, <br />
At last he safely gain&#8217;d th&#8217; Illyrian strand. <br />
Chearless himself, his consort still he chears, <br />
Hoary, and loaden&#8217;d both with woes and years. <br />
Then to recount past sorrows they begin, <br />
And trace them to the gloomy origin. <br />
That serpent sure was hallow&#8217;d, Cadmus cry&#8217;d, <br />
Which once my spear transfix&#8217;d with foolish pride; <br />
When the big teeth, a seed before unknown, <br />
By me along the wond&#8217;ring glebe were sown, <br />
And sprouting armies by themselves o&#8217;erthrown. <br />
If thence the wrath of Heav&#8217;n on me is bent, <br />
May Heav&#8217;n conclude it with one sad event; <br />
To an extended serpent change the man: <br />
And while he spoke, the wish&#8217;d-for change began. <br />
His skin with sea-green spots was vary&#8217;d &#8217;round, <br />
And on his belly prone he prest the ground. <br />
He glitter&#8217;d soon with many a golden scale, <br />
And his shrunk legs clos&#8217;d in a spiry tail. <br />
Arms yet remain&#8217;d, remaining arms he spread <br />
To his lov&#8217;d wife, and human tears yet shed. <br />
Come, my Harmonia, come, thy face recline <br />
Down to my face; still touch, what still is mine. <br />
O! let these hands, while hands, be gently prest, <br />
While yet the serpent has not all possest. <br />
More he had spoke, but strove to speak in vain, <br />
The forky tongue refus&#8217;d to tell his pain, <br />
And learn&#8217;d in hissings only to complain.</p>
<p>Then shriek&#8217;d Harmonia, Stay, my Cadmus, stay, <br />
Glide not in such a monstrous shape away! <br />
Destruction, like impetuous waves, rouls on. <br />
Where are thy feet, thy legs, thy shoulders gone? <br />
Chang&#8217;d is thy visage, chang&#8217;d is all thy frame; <br />
Cadmus is only Cadmus now in name. <br />
Ye Gods, my Cadmus to himself restore, <br />
Or me like him transform; I ask no more.</p>
<p>The husband-serpent show&#8217;d he still had thought, <br />
With wonted fondness an embrace he sought; <br />
Play&#8217;d &#8217;round her neck in many a harmless twist, <br />
And lick&#8217;d that bosom, which, a man, he kist. <br />
The lookers-on (for lookers-on there were) <br />
Shock&#8217;d at the sight, half-dy&#8217;d away with fear. <br />
The transformation was again renew&#8217;d, <br />
And, like the husband, chang&#8217;d the wife they view&#8217;d. <br />
Both, serpents now, with fold involv&#8217;d in fold, <br />
To the next covert amicably roul&#8217;d. <br />
There curl&#8217;d they lie, or wave along the green, <br />
Fearless see men, by men are fearless seen, <br />
Still mild, and conscious what they once have been.</p>
<p>The Story of Perseus</p>
<p>Yet tho&#8217; this harsh, inglorious fate they found, <br />
Each in the deathless grandson liv&#8217;d renown&#8217;d. <br />
Thro&#8217; conquer&#8217;d India Bacchus nobly rode, <br />
And Greece with temples hail&#8217;d the conqu&#8217;ring God. <br />
In Argos only proud Acrisius reign&#8217;d, <br />
Who all the consecrated rites profan&#8217;d. <br />
Audacious wretch! thus Bacchus to deny, <br />
And the great Thunderer&#8217;s great son defie! <br />
Nor him alone: thy daughter vainly strove, <br />
Brave Perseus of celestial stem to prove, <br />
And her self pregnant by a golden Jove. <br />
Yet this was true, and truth in time prevails; <br />
Acrisius now his unbelief bewails. <br />
His former thought, an impious thought he found, <br />
And both the heroe, and the God were own&#8217;d. <br />
He saw, already one in Heav&#8217;n was plac&#8217;d, <br />
And one with more than mortal triumphs grac&#8217;d, <br />
The victor Perseus with the Gorgon-head, <br />
O&#8217;er Libyan sands his airy journey sped. <br />
The gory drops distill&#8217;d, as swift he flew, <br />
And from each drop envenom&#8217;d serpents grew, <br />
The mischiefs brooded on the barren plains, <br />
And still th&#8217; unhappy fruitfulness remains.</p>
<p>Atlas transform&#8217;d to a Mountain</p>
<p>Thence Perseus, like a cloud, by storms was driv&#8217;n, <br />
Thro&#8217; all th&#8217; expanse beneath the cope of Heaven. <br />
The jarring winds unable to controul, <br />
He saw the southern, and the northern pole: <br />
And eastward thrice, and westward thrice was whirl&#8217;d, <br />
And from the skies survey&#8217;d the nether world. <br />
But when grey ev&#8217;ning show&#8217;d the verge of night, <br />
He fear&#8217;d in darkness to pursue his flight. <br />
He pois&#8217;d his pinions, and forgot to soar, <br />
And sinking, clos&#8217;d them on th&#8217; Hesperian shore: <br />
Then beg&#8217;d to rest, &#8217;till Lucifer begun <br />
To wake the morn, the morn to wake the sun.</p>
<p>Here Atlas reign&#8217;d, of more than human size, <br />
And in his kingdom the world&#8217;s limit lies. <br />
Here Titan bids his weary&#8217;d coursers sleep, <br />
And cools the burning axle in the deep. <br />
The mighty monarch, uncontrol&#8217;d, alone, <br />
His sceptre sways: no neighb&#8217;ring states are known. <br />
A thousand flocks on shady mountains fed, <br />
A thousand herds o&#8217;er grassy plains were spread. <br />
Here wond&#8217;rous trees their shining stores unfold, <br />
Their shining stores too wond&#8217;rous to be told, <br />
Their leafs, their branches, and their apples, gold. <br />
Then Perseus the gigantick prince addrest, <br />
Humbly implor&#8217;d a hospitable rest. <br />
If bold exploits thy admiration fire, <br />
He said, I fancy, mine thou wilt admire. <br />
Or if the glory of a race can move, <br />
Not mean my glory, for I spring from Jove. <br />
At this confession Atlas ghastly star&#8217;d, <br />
Mindful of what an oracle declar&#8217;d, <br />
That the dark womb of Time conceal&#8217;d a day, <br />
Which should, disclos&#8217;d, the bloomy gold betray: <br />
All should at once be ravish&#8217;d from his eyes, <br />
And Jove&#8217;s own progeny enjoy the prize. <br />
For this, the fruit he loftily immur&#8217;d, <br />
And a fierce dragon the strait pass secur&#8217;d. <br />
For this, all strangers he forbad to land, <br />
And drove them from th&#8217; inhospitable strand. <br />
To Perseus then: Fly quickly, fly this coast, <br />
Nor falsly dare thy acts and race to boast. <br />
In vain the heroe for one night entreats, <br />
Threat&#8217;ning he storms, and next adds force to threats. <br />
By strength not Perseus could himself defend, <br />
For who in strength with Atlas could contend? <br />
But since short rest to me thou wilt not give, <br />
A gift of endless rest from me receive, <br />
He said, and backward turn&#8217;d, no more conceal&#8217;d <br />
The present, and Medusa&#8217;s head reveal&#8217;d. <br />
Soon the high Atlas a high mountain stood, <br />
His locks, and beard became a leafy wood. <br />
His hands, and shoulders, into ridges went, <br />
The summit-head still crown&#8217;d the steep ascent. <br />
His bones a solid, rocky hardness gain&#8217;d: <br />
He, thus immensely grown (as fate ordain&#8217;d), <br />
The stars, the Heav&#8217;ns, and all the Gods sustain&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Andromeda rescu&#8217;d from the Sea Monster</p>
<p>Now Aeolus had with strong chains confin&#8217;d, <br />
And deep imprison&#8217;d e&#8217;vry blust&#8217;ring wind, <br />
The rising Phospher with a purple light <br />
Did sluggish mortals to new toils invite. <br />
His feet again the valiant Perseus plumes, <br />
And his keen sabre in his hand resumes: <br />
Then nobly spurns the ground, and upwards springs, <br />
And cuts the liquid air with sounding wings. <br />
O&#8217;er various seas, and various lands he past, <br />
&#8216;Till Aethiopia&#8217;s shore appear&#8217;d at last. <br />
Andromeda was there, doom&#8217;d to attone <br />
By her own ruin follies not her own: <br />
And if injustice in a God can be, <br />
Such was the Libyan God&#8217;s unjust decree. <br />
Chain&#8217;d to a rock she stood; young Perseus stay&#8217;d <br />
His rapid flight, to view the beauteous maid. <br />
So sweet her frame, so exquisitely fine, <br />
She seem&#8217;d a statue by a hand divine, <br />
Had not the wind her waving tresses show&#8217;d, <br />
And down her cheeks the melting sorrows flow&#8217;d. <br />
Her faultless form the heroe&#8217;s bosom fires; <br />
The more he looks, the more he still admires. <br />
Th&#8217; admirer almost had forgot to fly, <br />
And swift descended, flutt&#8217;ring from on high. <br />
O! Virgin, worthy no such chains to prove, <br />
But pleasing chains in the soft folds of love; <br />
Thy country, and thy name (he said) disclose, <br />
And give a true rehearsal of thy woes.</p>
<p>A quick reply her bashfulness refus&#8217;d, <br />
To the free converse of a man unus&#8217;d. <br />
Her rising blushes had concealment found <br />
From her spread hands, but that her hands were bound. <br />
She acted to her full extent of pow&#8217;r, <br />
And bath&#8217;d her face with a fresh, silent show&#8217;r. <br />
But by degrees in innocence grown bold, <br />
Her name, her country, and her birth she told: <br />
And how she suffer&#8217;d for her mother&#8217;s pride, <br />
Who with the Nereids once in beauty vy&#8217;d. <br />
Part yet untold, the seas began to roar, <br />
And mounting billows tumbled to the shore. <br />
Above the waves a monster rais&#8217;d his head, <br />
His body o&#8217;er the deep was widely spread: <br />
Onward he flounc&#8217;d; aloud the virgin cries; <br />
Each parent to her shrieks in shrieks replies: <br />
But she had deepest cause to rend the skies. <br />
Weeping, to her they cling; no sign appears <br />
Of help, they only lend their helpless tears. <br />
Too long you vent your sorrows, Perseus said, <br />
Short is the hour, and swift the time of aid, <br />
In me the son of thund&#8217;ring Jove behold, <br />
Got in a kindly show&#8217;r of fruitful gold. <br />
Medusa&#8217;s snaky head is now my prey, <br />
And thro&#8217; the clouds I boldly wing my way. <br />
If such desert be worthy of esteem, <br />
And, if your daughter I from death redeem, <br />
Shall she be mine? Shall it not then be thought, <br />
A bride, so lovely, was too cheaply bought? <br />
For her my arms I willingly employ, <br />
If I may beauties, which I save, enjoy. <br />
The parents eagerly the terms embrace: <br />
For who would slight such terms in such a case? <br />
Nor her alone they promise, but beside, <br />
The dowry of a kingdom with the bride.</p>
<p>As well-rigg&#8217;d gallies, which slaves, sweating, row, <br />
With their sharp beaks the whiten&#8217;d ocean plough; <br />
So when the monster mov&#8217;d, still at his back <br />
The furrow&#8217;d waters left a foamy track. <br />
Now to the rock he was advanc&#8217;d so nigh, <br />
Whirl&#8217;d from a sling a stone the space would fly. <br />
Then bounding, upwards the brave Perseus sprung, <br />
And in mid air on hov&#8217;ring pinions hung. <br />
His shadow quickly floated on the main; <br />
The monster could not his wild rage restrain, <br />
But at the floating shadow leap&#8217;d in vain. <br />
As when Jove&#8217;s bird, a speckl&#8217;d serpent spies, <br />
Which in the shine of Phoebus basking lies, <br />
Unseen, he souses down, and bears away, <br />
Truss&#8217;d from behind, the vainly-hissing prey. <br />
To writh his neck the labour nought avails, <br />
Too deep th&#8217; imperial talons pierce his scales. <br />
Thus the wing&#8217;d heroe now descends, now soars, <br />
And at his pleasure the vast monster gores. <br />
Full in his back, swift stooping from above, <br />
The crooked sabre to its hilt he drove. <br />
The monster rag&#8217;d, impatient of the pain, <br />
First bounded high, and then sunk low again. <br />
Now, like a savage boar, when chaf&#8217;d with wounds, <br />
And bay&#8217;d with opening mouths of hungry hounds, <br />
He on the foe turns with collected might, <br />
Who still eludes him with an airy flight; <br />
And wheeling round, the scaly armour tries <br />
Of his thick sides; his thinner tall now plies: <br />
&#8216;Till from repeated strokes out gush&#8217;d a flood, <br />
And the waves redden&#8217;d with the streaming blood. <br />
At last the dropping wings, befoam&#8217;d all o&#8217;er, <br />
With flaggy heaviness their master bore: <br />
A rock he spy&#8217;d, whose humble head was low, <br />
Bare at an ebb, but cover&#8217;d at a flow. <br />
A ridgy hold, he, thither flying, gain&#8217;d, <br />
And with one hand his bending weight sustain&#8217;d; <br />
With th&#8217; other, vig&#8217;rous blows he dealt around, <br />
And the home-thrusts the expiring monster own&#8217;d. <br />
In deaf&#8217;ning shouts the glad applauses rise, <br />
And peal on peal runs ratling thro&#8217; the skies. <br />
The saviour-youth the royal pair confess, <br />
And with heav&#8217;d hands their daughter&#8217;s bridegroom bless. <br />
The beauteous bride moves on, now loos&#8217;d from chains, <br />
The cause, and sweet reward of all the heroe&#8217;s pains,</p>
<p>Mean-time, on shore triumphant Perseus stood, <br />
And purg&#8217;d his hands, smear&#8217;d with the monster&#8217;s blood: <br />
Then in the windings of a sandy bed <br />
Compos&#8217;d Medusa&#8217;s execrable head. <br />
But to prevent the roughness, leafs he threw, <br />
And young, green twigs, which soft in waters grew, <br />
There soft, and full of sap; but here, when lay&#8217;d, <br />
Touch&#8217;d by the head, that softness soon decay&#8217;d. <br />
The wonted flexibility quite gone, <br />
The tender scyons harden&#8217;d into stone. <br />
Fresh, juicy twigs, surpriz&#8217;d, the Nereids brought, <br />
Fresh, juicy twigs the same contagion caught. <br />
The nymphs the petrifying seeds still keep, <br />
And propagate the wonder thro&#8217; the deep. <br />
The pliant sprays of coral yet declare <br />
Their stiff&#8217;ning Nature, when expos&#8217;d to air. <br />
Those sprays, which did, like bending osiers, move, <br />
Snatch&#8217;d from their element, obdurate prove, <br />
And shrubs beneath the waves, grow stones above.</p>
<p>The great immortals grateful Perseus prais&#8217;d, <br />
And to three Pow&#8217;rs three turfy altars rais&#8217;d. <br />
To Hermes this; and that he did assign <br />
To Pallas: the mid honours, Jove, were thine, <br />
He hastes for Pallas a white cow to cull, <br />
A calf for Hermes, but for Jove a bull. <br />
Then seiz&#8217;d the prize of his victorious fight, <br />
Andromeda, and claim&#8217;d the nuptial rite. <br />
Andromeda alone he greatly sought, <br />
The dowry kingdom was not worth his thought.</p>
<p>Pleas&#8217;d Hymen now his golden torch displays; <br />
With rich oblations fragrant altars blaze, <br />
Sweet wreaths of choicest flow&#8217;rs are hung on high, <br />
And cloudless pleasure smiles in ev&#8217;ry eye. <br />
The melting musick melting thoughts inspires, <br />
And warbling songsters aid the warbling lyres. <br />
The palace opens wide in pompous state, <br />
And by his peers surrounded, Cepheus sate. <br />
A feast was serv&#8217;d, fit for a king to give, <br />
And fit for God-like heroes to receive. <br />
The banquet ended, the gay, chearful bowl <br />
Mov&#8217;d round, and brighten&#8217;d, and enlarg&#8217;d each soul. <br />
Then Perseus ask&#8217;d, what customs there obtain&#8217;d, <br />
And by what laws the people were restrain&#8217;d. <br />
Which told; the teller a like freedom takes, <br />
And to the warrior his petition makes, <br />
To know, what arts had won Medusa&#8217;s snakes.</p>
<p>The Story of Medusa&#8217;s Head</p>
<p>The heroe with his just request complies, <br />
Shows, how a vale beneath cold Atlas lies, <br />
Where, with aspiring mountains fenc&#8217;d around, <br />
He the two daughters of old Phorcus found. <br />
Fate had one common eye to both assign&#8217;d, <br />
Each saw by turns, and each by turns was blind. <br />
But while one strove to lend her sister sight, <br />
He stretch&#8217;d his hand, and stole their mutual light, <br />
And left both eyeless, both involv&#8217;d in night. <br />
Thro&#8217; devious wilds, and trackless woods he past, <br />
And at the Gorgon-seats arriv&#8217;d at last: <br />
But as he journey&#8217;d, pensive he survey&#8217;d, <br />
What wasteful havock dire Medusa made. <br />
Here, stood still breathing statues, men before; <br />
There, rampant lions seem&#8217;d in stone to roar. <br />
Nor did he, yet affrighted, quit the field, <br />
But in the mirror of his polish&#8217;d shield <br />
Reflected saw Medusa slumbers take, <br />
And not one serpent by good chance awake. <br />
Then backward an unerring blow he sped, <br />
And from her body lop&#8217;d at once her head. <br />
The gore prolifick prov&#8217;d; with sudden force <br />
Sprung Pegasus, and wing&#8217;d his airy course.</p>
<p>The Heav&#8217;n-born warrior faithfully went on, <br />
And told the num&#8217;rous dangers which he run. <br />
What subject seas, what lands he had in view, <br />
And nigh what stars th&#8217; advent&#8217;rous heroe flew. <br />
At last he silent sate; the list&#8217;ning throng <br />
Sigh&#8217;d at the pause of his delightful tongue. <br />
Some beg&#8217;d to know, why this alone should wear, <br />
Of all the sisters, such destructive hair.</p>
<p>Great Perseus then: With me you shall prevail, <br />
Worth the relation, to relate a tale. <br />
Medusa once had charms; to gain her love <br />
A rival crowd of envious lovers strove. <br />
They, who have seen her, own, they ne&#8217;er did trace <br />
More moving features in a sweeter face. <br />
Yet above all, her length of hair, they own, <br />
In golden ringlets wav&#8217;d, and graceful shone. <br />
Her Neptune saw, and with such beauties fir&#8217;d, <br />
Resolv&#8217;d to compass, what his soul desir&#8217;d. <br />
In chaste Minerva&#8217;s fane, he, lustful, stay&#8217;d, <br />
And seiz&#8217;d, and rifled the young, blushing maid. <br />
The bashful Goddess turn&#8217;d her eyes away, <br />
Nor durst such bold impurity survey; <br />
But on the ravish&#8217;d virgin vengeance takes, <br />
Her shining hair is chang&#8217;d to hissing snakes. <br />
These in her Aegis Pallas joys to bear, <br />
The hissing snakes her foes more sure ensnare, <br />
Than they did lovers once, when shining hair. </p>
