				<p>The Story of Medea and Jason</p>
<p>The Argonauts now stemm&#8217;d the foaming tide, <br />
And to Arcadia&#8217;s shore their course apply&#8217;d; <br />
Where sightless Phineus spent his age in grief, <br />
But Boreas&#8217; sons engage in his relief; <br />
And those unwelcome guests, the odious race <br />
Of Harpyes, from the monarch&#8217;s table chase. <br />
With Jason then they greater toils sustain, <br />
And Phasis&#8217; slimy banks at last they gain, <br />
Here boldly they demand the golden prize <br />
Of Scythia&#8217;s king, who sternly thus replies: <br />
That mighty labours they must first o&#8217;ercome, <br />
Or sail their Argo thence unfreighted home. <br />
Meanwhile Medea, seiz&#8217;d with fierce desire, <br />
By reason strives to quench the raging fire; <br />
But strives in vain!- Some God (she said) withstands, <br />
And reason&#8217;s baffl&#8217;d council countermands. <br />
What unseen Pow&#8217;r does this disorder move? <br />
&#8216;Tis love,- at least &#8217;tis like, what men call love. <br />
Else wherefore shou&#8217;d the king&#8217;s commands appear <br />
To me too hard?- But so indeed they are. <br />
Why shou&#8217;d I for a stranger fear, lest he <br />
Shou&#8217;d perish, whom I did but lately see? <br />
His death, or safety, what are they to me? <br />
Wretch, from thy virgin-breast this flame expel, <br />
And soon- Oh cou&#8217;d I, all wou&#8217;d then be well! <br />
But love, resistless love, my soul invades; <br />
Discretion this, affection that perswades. <br />
I see the right, and I approve it too, <br />
Condemn the wrong- and yet the wrong pursue. <br />
Why, royal maid, shou&#8217;dst thou desire to wed <br />
A wanderer, and court a foreign bed? <br />
Thy native land, tho&#8217; barb&#8217;rous, can present <br />
A bridegroom worth a royal bride&#8217;s content: <br />
And whether this advent&#8217;rer lives, or dies, <br />
In Fate, and Fortune&#8217;s fickle pleasure lies. <br />
Yet may be live! for to the Pow&#8217;rs above, <br />
A virgin, led by no impulse of love, <br />
So just a suit may, for the guiltless, move. <br />
Whom wou&#8217;d not Jason&#8217;s valour, youth and blood <br />
Invite? or cou&#8217;d these merits be withstood, <br />
At least his charming person must encline <br />
The hardest heart- I&#8217;m sure &#8217;tis so with mine! <br />
Yet, if I help him not, the flaming breath <br />
Of bulls, and earth-born foes, must be his death. <br />
Or, should he through these dangers force his way, <br />
At last he must be made the dragon&#8217;s prey. <br />
If no remorse for such distress I feel, <br />
I am a tigress, and my breast is steel. <br />
Why do I scruple then to see him slain, <br />
And with the tragick scene my eyes prophane? <br />
My magick&#8217;s art employ, not to asswage <br />
The Salvages, but to enflame their rage? <br />
His earth-born foes to fiercer fury move, <br />
And accessary to his murder prove? <br />
The Gods forbid- But pray&#8217;rs are idle breath, <br />
When action only can prevent his death. <br />
Shall I betray my father, and the state, <br />
To intercept a rambling hero&#8217;s fate; <br />
Who may sail off next hour, and sav&#8217;d from harms <br />
By my assistance, bless another&#8217;s arms? <br />
Whilst I, not only of my hopes bereft, <br />
But to unpity&#8217;d punishment am left. <br />
If he is false, let the ingrateful bleed! <br />
But no such symptom in his looks I read. <br />
Nature wou&#8217;d ne&#8217;er have lavish&#8217;d so much grace <br />
Upon his person, if his soul were base. <br />
Besides, he first shall plight his faith, and swear <br />
By all the Gods; what therefore can&#8217;st thou fear? <br />
Medea haste, from danger set him free, <br />
Jason shall thy eternal debtor be. <br />
And thou, his queen, with sov&#8217;raign state enstall&#8217;d, <br />
By Graecian dames the Kind Preserver call&#8217;d. <br />
Hence idle dreams, by love-sick fancy bred! <br />
Wilt thou, Medea, by vain wishes led, <br />
To sister, brother, father bid adieu? <br />
Forsake thy country&#8217;s Gods, and country too? <br />
My father&#8217;s harsh, my brother but a child, <br />
My sister rivals me, my country&#8217;s wild; <br />
And for its Gods, the greatest of &#8216;em all <br />
Inspires my breast, and I obey his call. <br />
That great endearments I forsake, is true, <br />
But greater far the hopes that I pursue: <br />
The pride of having sav&#8217;d the youths of Greece <br />
(Each life more precious than our golden fleece); <br />
A nobler soil by me shall be possest, <br />
I shall see towns with arts and manners blest; <br />
And, what I prize above the world beside, <br />
Enjoy my Jason- and when once his bride, <br />
Be more than mortal, and to Gods ally&#8217;d. <br />
They talk of hazards I must first sustain, <br />
Of floating islands justling in the main; <br />
Our tender barque expos&#8217;d to dreadful shocks <br />
Of fierce Charybdis&#8217; gulf, and Scylla&#8217;s rocks, <br />
Where breaking waves in whirling eddies rowl, <br />
And rav&#8217;nous dogs that in deep caverns howl: <br />
Amidst these terrors, while I lye possest <br />
Of him I love, and lean on Jason&#8217;s breast, <br />
In tempests unconcern&#8217;d I will appear, <br />
Or, only for my husband&#8217;s safety fear. <br />
Didst thou say husband?- canst thou so deceive <br />
Thy self, fond maid, and thy own cheat believe? <br />
In vain thou striv&#8217;st to varnish o&#8217;er thy shame, <br />
And grace thy guilt with wedlock&#8217;s sacred name. <br />
Pull off the coz&#8217;ning masque, and oh! in time <br />
Discover and avoid the fatal crime. <br />
She ceas&#8217;d- the Graces now, with kind surprize, <br />
And virtue&#8217;s lovely train, before her eyes <br />
Present themselves, and vanquish&#8217;d Cupid flies.</p>
<p>She then retires to Hecate&#8217;s shrine, that stood <br />
Far in the covert of a shady wood: <br />
She finds the fury of her flames asswag&#8217;d, <br />
But, seeing Jason there, again they rag&#8217;d. <br />
Blushes, and paleness did by turns invade <br />
Her tender cheeks, and secret grief betray&#8217;d. <br />
As fire, that sleeping under ashes lyes, <br />
Fresh-blown, and rous&#8217;d, does up in blazes rise, <br />
So flam&#8217;d the virgin&#8217;s breast- <br />
New kindled by her lover&#8217;s sparkling eyes. <br />
For chance, that day, had with uncommon grace <br />
Adorn&#8217;d the lovely youth, and through his face <br />
Display&#8217;d an air so pleasing as might charm <br />
A Goddess, and a Vestal&#8217;s bosom warm. <br />
Her ravish&#8217;d eyes survey him o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er, <br />
As some gay wonder never seen before; <br />
Transported to the skies she seems to be, <br />
And thinks she gazes on a deity. <br />
But when he spoke, and prest her trembling hand, <br />
And did with tender words her aid demand, <br />
With vows, and oaths to make her soon his bride, <br />
She wept a flood of tears, and thus reply&#8217;d: <br />
I see my error, yet to ruin move, <br />
Nor owe my fate to ignorance, but love: <br />
Your life I&#8217;ll guard, and only crave of you <br />
To swear once more- and to your oath be true. <br />
He swears by Hecate he would all fulfil, <br />
And by her grandfather&#8217;s prophetick skill, <br />
By ev&#8217;ry thing that doubting love cou&#8217;d press, <br />
His present danger, and desir&#8217;d success. <br />
She credits him, and kindly does produce <br />
Enchanted herbs, and teaches him their use: <br />
Their mystick names, and virtues he admires, <br />
And with his booty joyfully retires.</p>
<p>The Dragon&#8217;s Teeth transform&#8217;d to Men</p>
<p>Impatient for the wonders of the day, <br />
Aurora drives the loyt&#8217;ring stars away. <br />
Now Mars&#8217;s mount the pressing people fill, <br />
The crowd below, the nobles crown the hill; <br />
The king himself high-thron&#8217;d above the rest, <br />
With iv&#8217;ry scepter, and in purple drest.</p>
<p>Forthwith the brass-hoof&#8217;d bulls are set at large, <br />
Whose furious nostrils sulph&#8217;rous flame discharge: <br />
The blasted herbage by their breath expires; <br />
As forges rumble with excessive fires, <br />
And furnaces with fiercer fury glow, <br />
When water on the panting mass ye throw; <br />
With such a noise, from their convulsive breast, <br />
Thro&#8217; bellowing throats, the struggling vapour prest.</p>
<p>Yet Jason marches up without concern, <br />
While on th&#8217; advent&#8217;rous youth the monsters turn <br />
Their glaring eyes, and, eager to engage, <br />
Brandish their steel-tipt horns in threatning rage: <br />
With brazen hoofs they beat the ground, and choak <br />
The ambient air with clouds of dust and smoak: <br />
Each gazing Graecian for his champion shakes, <br />
While bold advances he securely makes <br />
Thro&#8217; sindging blasts; such wonders magick art <br />
Can work, when love conspires, and plays his part. <br />
The passive savages like statues stand, <br />
While he their dew-laps stroaks with soothing hand; <br />
To unknown yokes their brawny necks they yield, <br />
And, like tame oxen, plow the wond&#8217;ring field. <br />
The Colchians stare; the Graecians shout, and raise <br />
Their champion&#8217;s courage with inspiring praise.</p>
<p>Embolden&#8217;d now, on fresh attempts he goes, <br />
With serpent&#8217;s teeth the fertile furrows sows; <br />
The glebe, fermenting with inchanted juice, <br />
Makes the snake&#8217;s teeth a human crop produce. <br />
For as an infant, pris&#8217;ner to the womb, <br />
Contented sleeps, &#8217;till to perfection come, <br />
Then does the cell&#8217;s obscure confinement scorn, <br />
He tosses, throbs, and presses to be born; <br />
So from the lab&#8217;ring Earth no single birth, <br />
But a whole troop of lusty youths rush forth; <br />
And, what&#8217;s more strange, with martial fury warm&#8217;d, <br />
And for encounter all compleatly arm&#8217;d; <br />
In rank and file, as they were sow&#8217;d, they stand, <br />
Impatient for the signal of command. <br />
No foe but the Aemonian youth appears; <br />
At him they level their steel-pointed spears; <br />
His frighted friends, who triumph&#8217;d, just before, <br />
With peals of sighs his desp&#8217;rate case deplore: <br />
And where such hardy warriors are afraid, <br />
What must the tender, and enamour&#8217;d maid? <br />
Her spirits sink, the blood her cheek forsook; <br />
She fears, who for his safety undertook: <br />
She knew the vertue of the spells she gave, <br />
She knew the force, and knew her lover brave; <br />
But what&#8217;s a single champion to an host? <br />
Yet scorning thus to see him tamely lost, <br />
Her strong reserve of secret arts she brings, <br />
And last, her never-failing song she sings. <br />
Wonders ensue; among his gazing foes <br />
The massy fragment of a rock he throws; <br />
This charm in civil war engag&#8217;d &#8216;em all; <br />
By mutual wounds those Earth-born brothers fall.</p>
<p>The Greeks, transported with the strange success, <br />
Leap from their seats the conqu&#8217;ror to caress; <br />
Commend, and kiss, and clasp him in their arms: <br />
So would the kind contriver of the charms; <br />
But her, who felt the tenderest concern, <br />
Honour condemns in secret flames to burn; <br />
Committed to a double guard of fame, <br />
Aw&#8217;d by a virgin&#8217;s, and a princess&#8217; name. <br />
But thoughts are free, and fancy unconfin&#8217;d, <br />
She kisses, courts, and hugs him in her mind; <br />
To fav&#8217;ring Pow&#8217;rs her silent thanks she gives, <br />
By whose indulgence her lov&#8217;d hero lives.</p>
<p>One labour more remains, and, tho&#8217; the last, <br />
In danger far surmounting all the past; <br />
That enterprize by Fates in store was kept, <br />
To make the dragon sleep that never slept, <br />
Whose crest shoots dreadful lustre; from his jaws <br />
A tripple tire of forked stings he draws, <br />
With fangs, and wings of a prodigious size: <br />
Such was the guardian of the golden prize. <br />
Yet him, besprinkled with Lethaean dew, <br />
The fair inchantress into slumber threw; <br />
And then, to fix him, thrice she did repeat <br />
The rhyme, that makes the raging winds retreat, <br />
In stormy seas can halcyon seasons make, <br />
Turn rapid streams into a standing lake; <br />
While the soft guest his drowzy eye-lids seals, <br />
Th&#8217; ungarded golden fleece the stranger steals; <br />
Proud to possess the purchase of his toil, <br />
Proud of his royal bride, the richer spoil; <br />
To sea both prize, and patroness he bore, <br />
And lands triumphant on his native shore.</p>
<p>Old Aeson restor&#8217;d to Youth</p>
<p>Aemonian matrons, who their absence mourn&#8217;d, <br />
Rejoyce to see their prosp&#8217;rous sons return&#8217;d: <br />
Rich curling fumes of incense feast the skies, <br />
An hecatomb of voted victims dies, <br />
With gilded horns, and garlands on their head, <br />
And all the pomp of death, to th&#8217; altar led. <br />
Congratulating bowls go briskly round, <br />
Triumphant shouts in louder musick drown&#8217;d. <br />
Amidst these revels, why that cloud of care <br />
On Jason&#8217;s brow? (to whom the largest share <br />
Of mirth was due)- His father was not there. <br />
Aeson was absent, once the young, and brave, <br />
Now crush&#8217;d with years, and bending to the grave. <br />
At last withdrawn, and by the crowd unseen, <br />
Pressing her hand (with starting sighs between), <br />
He supplicates his kind, and skilful queen.</p>
<p>O patroness! preserver of my life! <br />
(Dear when my mistress, and much dearer wife) <br />
Your favours to so vast a sum amount, <br />
&#8216;Tis past the pow&#8217;r of numbers to recount; <br />
Or cou&#8217;d they be to computation brought, <br />
The history would a romance be thought: <br />
And yet, unless you add one favour more, <br />
Greater than all that you conferr&#8217;d before, <br />
But not too hard for love and magick skill, <br />
Your past are thrown away, and Jason&#8217;s wretched still. <br />
The morning of my life is just begun, <br />
But my declining father&#8217;s race is run; <br />
From my large stock retrench the long arrears, <br />
And add &#8216;em to expiring Aeson&#8217;s years.</p>
<p>Thus spake the gen&#8217;rous youth, and wept the rest. <br />
Mov&#8217;d with the piety of his request, <br />
To his ag&#8217;d sire such filial duty shown, <br />
So diff&#8217;rent from her treatment of her own, <br />
But still endeav&#8217;ring her remorse to hide, <br />
She check&#8217;d her rising sighs, and thus reply&#8217;d.</p>
<p>How cou&#8217;d the thought of such inhuman wrong <br />
Escape (said she) from pious Jason&#8217;s tongue? <br />
Does the whole world another Jason bear, <br />
Whose life Medea can to yours prefer? <br />
Or cou&#8217;d I with so dire a change dispence, <br />
Hecate will never join in that offence: <br />
Unjust is the request you make, and I <br />
In kindness your petition shall deny; <br />
Yet she that grants not what you do implore, <br />
Shall yet essay to give her Jason more; <br />
Find means t&#8217; encrease the stock of Aeson&#8217;s years, <br />
Without retrenchment of your life&#8217;s arrears; <br />
Provided that the triple Goddess join <br />
A strong confed&#8217;rate in my bold design.</p>
<p>Thus was her enterprize resolv&#8217;d; but still <br />
Three tedious nights are wanting to fulfil <br />
The circling crescents of th&#8217; encreasing moon; <br />
Then, in the height of her nocturnal noon, <br />
Medea steals from court; her ankles bare, <br />
Her garments closely girt, but loose her hair; <br />
Thus sally&#8217;d, like a solitary sprite, <br />
She traverses the terrors of the night.</p>
<p>Men, beasts, and birds in soft repose lay charm&#8217;d, <br />
No boistrous wind the mountain-woods alarm&#8217;d; <br />
Nor did those walks of love, the myrtle-trees, <br />
Of am&#8217;rous Zephir hear the whisp&#8217;ring breeze; <br />
All elements chain&#8217;d in unactive rest, <br />
No sense but what the twinkling stars exprest; <br />
To them (that only wak&#8217;d) she rears her arm, <br />
And thus commences her mysterious charms.</p>
<p>She turn&#8217;d her thrice about, as oft she threw <br />
On her pale tresses the nocturnal dew; <br />
Then yelling thrice a most enormous sound, <br />
Her bare knee bended on the flinty ground. <br />
O night (said she) thou confident and guide <br />
Of secrets, such as darkness ought to hide; <br />
Ye stars and moon, that, when the sun retires, <br />
Support his empire with succeeding fires; <br />
And thou, great Hecate, friend to my design; <br />
Songs, mutt&#8217;ring spells, your magick forces join; <br />
And thou, O Earth, the magazine that yields <br />
The midnight sorcerer drugs; skies, mountains, fields; <br />
Ye wat&#8217;ry Pow&#8217;rs of fountain, stream, and lake; <br />
Ye sylvan Gods, and Gods of night, awake, <br />
And gen&#8217;rously your parts in my adventure take.</p>
<p>Oft by your aid swift currents I have led <br />
Thro&#8217; wand&#8217;ring banks, back to their fountain head; <br />
Transformed the prospect of the briny deep, <br />
Made sleeping billows rave, and raving billows sleep; <br />
Made clouds, or sunshine; tempests rise, or fall; <br />
And stubborn lawless winds obey my call: <br />
With mutter&#8217;d words disarm&#8217;d the viper&#8217;s jaw; <br />
Up by the roots vast oaks, and rocks cou&#8217;d draw, <br />
Make forests dance, and trembling mountains come, <br />
Like malefactors, to receive their doom; <br />
Earth groan, and frighted ghosts forsake their tomb. <br />
Thee, Cynthia, my resistless rhymes drew down, <br />
When tinkling cymbals strove my voice to drown; <br />
Nor stronger Titan could their force sustain, <br />
In full career compell&#8217;d to stop his wain: <br />
Nor could Aurora&#8217;s virgin blush avail, <br />
With pois&#8217;nous herbs I turn&#8217;d her roses pale; <br />
The fury of the fiery bulls I broke, <br />
Their stubborn necks submitting to my yoke; <br />
And when the sons of Earth with fury burn&#8217;d, <br />
Their hostile rage upon themselves I turn&#8217;d; <br />
The brothers made with mutual wounds to bleed, <br />
And by their fatal strife my lover freed; <br />
And, while the dragon slept, to distant Greece, <br />
Thro&#8217; cheated guards, convey&#8217;d the golden fleece. <br />
But now to bolder action I proceed, <br />
Of such prevailing juices now have need, <br />
That wither&#8217;d years back to their bloom can bring, <br />
And in dead winter raise a second spring. <br />
And you&#8217;ll perform&#8217;t- <br />
You will; for lo! the stars, with sparkling fires, <br />
Presage as bright success to my desires: <br />
And now another happy omen see! <br />
A chariot drawn by dragons waits for me.</p>
<p>With these last words he leaps into the wain, <br />
Stroaks the snakes&#8217; necks, and shakes the golden rein; <br />
That signal giv&#8217;n, they mount her to the skies, <br />
And now beneath her fruitful Tempe lies, <br />
Whose stories she ransacks, then to Crete she flies; <br />
There Ossa, Pelion, Othrys, Pindus, all <br />
To the fair ravisher, a booty fall; <br />
The tribute of their verdure she collects, <br />
Nor proud Olympus&#8217; height his plants protects. <br />
Some by the roots she plucks; the tender tops <br />
Of others with her culling sickle crops. <br />
Nor could the plunder of the hills suffice, <br />
Down to the humble vales, and meads she flies; <br />
Apidanus, Amphrysus, the next rape <br />
Sustain, nor could Enipeus&#8217; bank escape; <br />
Thro&#8217; Beebe&#8217;s marsh, and thro&#8217; the border rang&#8217;d <br />
Whose pasture Glaucus to a Triton chang&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Now the ninth day, and ninth successive night, <br />
Had wonder&#8217;d at the restless rover&#8217;s flight; <br />
Mean-while her dragons, fed with no repast, <br />
But her exhaling simples od&#8217;rous blast, <br />
Their tarnish&#8217;d scales, and wrinkled skins had cast. <br />
At last return&#8217;d before her palace gate, <br />
Quitting her chariot, on the ground she sate; <br />
The sky her only canopy of state. <br />
All conversation with her sex she fled, <br />
Shun&#8217;d the caresses of the nuptial bed: <br />
Two altars next of grassy turf she rears, <br />
This Hecate&#8217;s name, that Youth&#8217;s inscription bears; <br />
With forest-boughs, and vervain these she crown&#8217;d; <br />
Then delves a double trench in lower ground, <br />
And sticks a black-fleec&#8217;d ram, that ready stood, <br />
And drench&#8217;d the ditches with devoted blood: <br />
New wine she pours, and milk from th&#8217; udder warm, <br />
With mystick murmurs to compleat the charm, <br />
And subterranean deities alarm. <br />
To the stern king of ghosts she next apply&#8217;d, <br />
And gentle Proserpine, his ravish&#8217;d bride, <br />
That for old Aeson with the laws of Fate <br />
They would dispense, and lengthen his short date; <br />
Thus with repeated pray&#8217;rs she long assails <br />
Th&#8217; infernal tyrant and at last prevails; <br />
Then calls to have decrepit Aeson brought, <br />
And stupifies him with a sleeping draught; <br />
On Earth his body, like a corpse, extends, <br />
Then charges Jason and his waiting friends <br />
To quit the place, that no unhallow&#8217;d eye <br />
Into her art&#8217;s forbidden secrets pry. <br />
This done, th&#8217; inchantress, with her locks unbound, <br />
About her altars trips a frantick round; <br />
Piece-meal the consecrated wood she splits, <br />
And dips the splinters in the bloody pits, <br />
Then hurles &#8216;em on the piles; the sleeping sire <br />
She lustrates thrice, with sulphur, water, fire.</p>
<p>In a large cauldron now the med&#8217;cine boils, <br />
Compounded of her late-collected spoils, <br />
Blending into the mesh the various pow&#8217;rs <br />
Of wonder-working juices, roots, and flow&#8217;rs; <br />
With gems i&#8217; th&#8217; eastern ocean&#8217;s cell refin&#8217;d, <br />
And such as ebbing tides had left behind; <br />
To them the midnight&#8217;s pearly dew she flings, <br />
A scretch-owl&#8217;s carcase, and ill boding wings; <br />
Nor could the wizard wolf&#8217;s warm entrails scape <br />
(That wolf who counterfeits a human shape). <br />
Then, from the bottom of her conj&#8217;ring bag, <br />
Snakes&#8217; skins, and liver of a long-liv&#8217;d stag; <br />
Last a crow&#8217;s head to such an age arriv&#8217;d, <br />
That he had now nine centuries surviv&#8217;d; <br />
These, and with these a thousand more that grew <br />
In sundry soils, into her pot she threw; <br />
Then with a wither&#8217;d olive-bough she rakes <br />
The bubling broth; the bough fresh verdure takes; <br />
Green leaves at first the perish&#8217;d plant surround, <br />
Which the next minute with ripe fruit were crown&#8217;d. <br />
The foaming juices now the brink o&#8217;er-swell; <br />
The barren heath, where-e&#8217;er the liquor fell, <br />
Sprang out with vernal grass, and all the pride <br />
Of blooming May- When this Medea spy&#8217;d, <br />
She cuts her patient&#8217;s throat; th&#8217; exhausted blood <br />
Recruiting with her new enchanted flood; <br />
While at his mouth, and thro&#8217; his op&#8217;ning wound, <br />
A double inlet her infusion found; <br />
His feeble frame resumes a youthful air, <br />
A glossy brown his hoary beard and hair. <br />
The meager paleness from his aspect fled, <br />
And in its room sprang up a florid red; <br />
Thro&#8217; all his limbs a youthful vigour flies, <br />
His empty&#8217;d art&#8217;ries swell with fresh supplies: <br />
Gazing spectators scarce believe their eyes. <br />
But Aeson is the most surpriz&#8217;d to find <br />
A happy change in body and in mind; <br />
In sense and constitution the same man, <br />
As when his fortieth active year began.</p>
<p>Bacchus, who from the clouds this wonder view&#8217;d, <br />
Medea&#8217;s method instantly pursu&#8217;d, <br />
And his indulgent nurse&#8217;s youth renew&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The Death of Pelias</p>
<p>Thus far obliging love employ&#8217;d her art, <br />
But now revenge must act a tragick part;</p>
<p>Medea feigns a mortal quarrel bred <br />
Betwixt her, and the partner of her bed; <br />
On this pretence to Pelias&#8217; court she flies, <br />
Who languishing with age and sickness lies: <br />
His guiltless daughters, with inveigling wiles, <br />
And well dissembled friendship, she beguiles: <br />
The strange achievements of her art she tells, <br />
With Aeson&#8217;s cure, and long on that she dwells, <br />
&#8216;Till them to firm perswasion she has won, <br />
The same for their old father may be done: <br />
For him they court her to employ her skill, <br />
And put upon the cure what price she will. <br />
At first she&#8217;s mute, and with a grave pretence <br />
Of difficulty, holds &#8216;em in suspense; <br />
Then promises, and bids &#8216;em, from the fold <br />
Chuse out a ram, the most infirm and old; <br />
That so by fact their doubts may be remov&#8217;d, <br />
And first on him the operation prov&#8217;d.</p>
<p>A wreath-horn&#8217;d ram is brought, so far o&#8217;er-grown <br />
With years, his age was to that age unknown <br />
Of sense too dull the piercing point to feel, <br />
And scarce sufficient blood to stain the steel. <br />
His carcass she into a cauldron threw, <br />
With drugs whose vital qualities she knew; <br />
His limbs grow less, he casts his horns, and years, <br />
And tender bleatings strike their wond&#8217;ring ears. <br />
Then instantly leaps forth a frisking lamb, <br />
That seeks (too young to graze) a suckling dam. <br />
The sisters, thus confirm&#8217;d with the success, <br />
Her promise with renew&#8217;d entreaty press; <br />
To countenance the cheat, three nights and days <br />
Before experiment th&#8217; inchantress stays; <br />
Then into limpid water, from the springs, <br />
Weeds, and ingredients of no force she flings; <br />
With antique ceremonies for pretence <br />
And rambling rhymes without a word of sense.</p>
<p>Mean-while the king with all his guards lay bound <br />
In magick sleep, scarce that of death so sound; <br />
The daughters now are by the sorc&#8217;ress led <br />
Into his chamber, and surround his bed. <br />
Your father&#8217;s health&#8217;s concern&#8217;d, and can ye stay? <br />
Unnat&#8217;ral nymphs, why this unkind delay? <br />
Unsheath your swords, dismiss his lifeless blood, <br />
And I&#8217;ll recruit it with a vital flood: <br />
Your father&#8217;s life and health is in your hand, <br />
And can ye thus like idle gazers stand? <br />
Unless you are of common sense bereft, <br />
If yet one spark of piety is left, <br />
Dispatch a father&#8217;s cure, and disengage <br />
The monarch from his toilsome load of age: <br />
Come- drench your weapons in his putrid gore; <br />
&#8216;Tis charity to wound, when wounding will restore.</p>
<p>Thus urg&#8217;d, the poor deluded maids proceed, <br />
Betray&#8217;d by zeal, to an inhumane deed, <br />
And, in compassion, make a father bleed. <br />
Yes, she who had the kindest, tend&#8217;rest heart, <br />
Is foremost to perform the bloody part.</p>
<p>Yet, tho&#8217; to act the butchery betray&#8217;d, <br />
They could not bear to see the wounds they made; <br />
With looks averted, backward they advance, <br />
Then strike, and stab, and leave the blows to chance.</p>
<p>Waking in consternation, he essays <br />
(Weltring in blood) his feeble arms to raise: <br />
Environ&#8217;d with so many swords- From whence <br />
This barb&#8217;rous usage? what is my offence? <br />
What fatal fury, what infernal charm, <br />
&#8216;Gainst a kind father does his daughters arm?</p>
<p>Hearing his voice, as thunder-struck they stopt, <br />
Their resolution, and their weapons dropt: <br />
Medea then the mortal blow bestows, <br />
And that perform&#8217;d, the tragick scene to close, <br />
His corpse into the boiling cauldron throws.</p>
<p>Then, dreading the revenge that must ensue, <br />
High mounted on her dragon-coach she flew; <br />
And in her stately progress thro&#8217; the skies, <br />
Beneath her shady Pelion first she spies, <br />
With Othrys, that above the clouds did rise; <br />
With skilful Chiron&#8217;s cave, and neighb&#8217;ring ground, <br />
For old Cerambus&#8217; strange escape renown&#8217;d, <br />
By nymphs deliver&#8217;d, when the world was drown&#8217;d; <br />
Who him with unexpected wings supply&#8217;d, <br />
When delug&#8217;d hills a safe retreat deny&#8217;d. <br />
Aeolian Pitane on her left hand <br />
She saw, and there the statu&#8217;d dragon stand; <br />
With Ida&#8217;s grove, where Bacchus, to disguise <br />
His son&#8217;s bold theft, and to secure the prize, <br />
Made the stoln steer a stag to represent; <br />
Cocytus&#8217; father&#8217;s sandy monument; <br />
And fields that held the murder&#8217;d sire&#8217;s remains, <br />
Where howling Moera frights the startled plains. <br />
Euryphilus&#8217; high town, with tow&#8217;rs defac&#8217;d <br />
By Hercules, and matrons more disgrac&#8217;d <br />
With sprouting horns, in signal punishment, <br />
From Juno, or resenting Venus sent. <br />
Then Rhodes, which Phoebus did so dearly prize, <br />
And Jove no less severely did chastize; <br />
For he the wizard native&#8217;s pois&#8217;ning sight, <br />
That us&#8217;d the farmer&#8217;s hopeful crops to blight, <br />
In rage o&#8217;erwhelm&#8217;d with everlasting night. <br />
Cartheia&#8217;s ancient walls come next in view, <br />
Where once the sire almost a statue grew <br />
With wonder, which a strange event did move, <br />
His daughter turn&#8217;d into a turtle-dove. <br />
Then Hyrie&#8217;s lake, and Tempe&#8217;s field o&#8217;er-ran, <br />
Fam&#8217;d for the boy who there became a swan; <br />
For there enamour&#8217;d Phyllius, like a slave, <br />
Perform&#8217;d what tasks his paramour would crave. <br />
For presents he had mountain-vultures caught, <br />
And from the desart a tame lion brought; <br />
Then a wild bull commanded to subdue, <br />
The conquer&#8217;d savage by the horns he drew; <br />
But, mock&#8217;d so oft, the treatment he disdains, <br />
And from the craving boy this prize detains. <br />
Then thus in choler the resenting lad: <br />
Won&#8217;t you deliver him?- You&#8217;ll wish you had: <br />
Nor sooner said, but, in a peevish mood, <br />
Leapt from the precipice on which he stood: <br />
The standers-by were struck with fresh surprize, <br />
Instead of falling, to behold him rise <br />
A snowy swan, and soaring to the skies.</p>
<p>But dearly the rash prank his mother cost, <br />
Who ignorantly gave her son for lost; <br />
For his misfortune wept, &#8217;till she became <br />
A lake, and still renown&#8217;d with Hyrie&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>Thence to Latona&#8217;s isle, where once were seen, <br />
Transform&#8217;d to birds, a monarch, and his queen. <br />
Far off she saw how old Cephisus mourn&#8217;d <br />
His son, into a seele by Phoebus turn&#8217;d; <br />
And where, astonish&#8217;d at a stranger sight, <br />
Eumelus gaz&#8217;d on his wing&#8217;d daughter&#8217;s flight.</p>
<p>Aetolian Pleuron she did next survey, <br />
Where sons a mother&#8217;s murder did essay, <br />
But sudden plumes the matron bore away. <br />
On her right hand, Cyllene, a fair soil, <br />
Fair, &#8217;till Menephron there the beauteous hill <br />
Attempted with foul incest to defile.</p>
<p>Her harness&#8217;d dragons now direct she drives <br />
For Corinth, and at Corinth she arrives; <br />
Where, if what old tradition tells, be true, <br />
In former ages men from mushrooms grew.</p>
<p>But here Medea finds her bed supply&#8217;d, <br />
During her absence, by another bride; <br />
And hopeless to recover her lost game, <br />
She sets both bride and palace in a flame. <br />
Nor could a rival&#8217;s death her wrath asswage, <br />
Nor stopt at Creon&#8217;s family her rage, <br />
She murders her own infants, in despight <br />
To faithless Jason, and in Jason&#8217;s sight; <br />
Yet e&#8217;er his sword could reach her, up she springs, <br />
Securely mounted on her dragon&#8217;s wings.</p>
<p>The Story of Aegeus</p>
<p>From hence to Athens she directs her flight, <br />
Where Phineus, so renown&#8217;d for doing right; <br />
Where Periphas, and Polyphemon&#8217;s neece, <br />
Soaring with sudden plumes amaz&#8217;d the towns of Greece.</p>
<p>Here Aegeus so engaging she addrest, <br />
That first he treats her like a royal guest; <br />
Then takes the sorc&#8217;ress for his wedded wife; <br />
The only blemish of his prudent life.</p>
<p>Mean-while his son, from actions of renown, <br />
Arrives at court, but to his sire unknown. <br />
Medea, to dispatch a dang&#8217;rous heir <br />
(She knew him), did a pois&#8217;nous draught prepare; <br />
Drawn from a drug, was long reserv&#8217;d in store <br />
For desp&#8217;rate uses, from the Scythian shore; <br />
That from the Echydnaean monster&#8217;s jaws <br />
Deriv&#8217;d its origin, and this the cause.</p>
<p>Thro&#8217; a dark cave a craggy passage lies, <br />
To ours, ascending from the nether skies; <br />
Thro&#8217; which, by strength of hand, Alcides drew <br />
Chain&#8217;d Cerberus, who lagg&#8217;d, and restive grew, <br />
With his blear&#8217;d eyes our brighter day to view. <br />
Thrice he repeated his enormous yell, <br />
With which he scares the ghosts, and startles Hell; <br />
At last outragious (tho&#8217; compell&#8217;d to yield) <br />
He sheds his foam in fury on the field,- <br />
Which, with its own, and rankness of the ground, <br />
Produc&#8217;d a weed, by sorcerers renown&#8217;d, <br />
The strongest constitution to confound; <br />
Call&#8217;d Aconite, because it can unlock <br />
All bars, and force its passage thro&#8217; a rock.</p>
<p>The pious father, by her wheedles won, <br />
Presents this deadly potion to his son; <br />
Who, with the same assurance takes the cup, <br />
And to the monarch&#8217;s health had drank it up, <br />
But in the very instant he apply&#8217;d <br />
The goblet to his lips, old Aegeus spy&#8217;d <br />
The iv&#8217;ry hilted sword that grac&#8217;d his side. <br />
That certain signal of his son he knew, <br />
And snatcht the bowl away; the sword he drew, <br />
Resolv&#8217;d, for such a son&#8217;s endanger&#8217;d life, <br />
To sacrifice the most perfidious wife. <br />
Revenge is swift, but her more active charms <br />
A whirlwind rais&#8217;d, that snatch&#8217;d her from his arms. <br />
While conjur&#8217;d clouds their baffled sense surprize, <br />
She vanishes from their deluded eyes, <br />
And thro&#8217; the hurricane triumphant flies.</p>
<p>The gen&#8217;rous king, altho&#8217; o&#8217;er-joy&#8217;d to find <br />
His son was safe, yet bearing still in mind <br />
The mischief by his treach&#8217;rous queen design&#8217;d; <br />
The horrour of the deed, and then how near <br />
The danger drew, he stands congeal&#8217;d with fear. <br />
But soon that fear into devotion turns, <br />
With grateful incense ev&#8217;ry altar burns; <br />
Proud victims, and unconscious of their fate, <br />
Stalk to the temple, there to die in state. <br />
In Athens never had a day been found <br />
For mirth, like that grand festival, renown&#8217;d. <br />
Promiscuously the peers, and people dine, <br />
Promiscuously their thankful voices join, <br />
In songs of wit, sublim&#8217;d by spritely wine. <br />
To list&#8217;ning spheres their joint applause they raise, <br />
And thus resound their matchless Theseus&#8217; praise.</p>
<p>Great Theseus! Thee the Marathonian plain <br />
Admires, and wears with pride the noble stain <br />
Of the dire monster&#8217;s blood, by valiant Theseus slain. <br />
That now Cromyon&#8217;s swains in safety sow, <br />
And reap their fertile field, to thee they owe. <br />
By thee th&#8217; infested Epidaurian coast <br />
Was clear&#8217;d, and now can a free commerce boast. <br />
The traveller his journey can pursue, <br />
With pleasure the late dreadful valley view, <br />
And cry, Here Theseus the grand robber slew. <br />
Cephysus&#8217; cries to his rescu&#8217;d shore, <br />
The merciless Procrustes is no more. <br />
In peace, Eleusis, Ceres&#8217; rites renew, <br />
Since Theseus&#8217; sword the fierce Cercyon slew. <br />
By him the tort&#8217;rer Sinis was destroy&#8217;d, <br />
Of strength (but strength to barb&#8217;rous use employ&#8217;d) <br />
That tops of tallest pines to Earth could bend, <br />
And thus in pieces wretched captives rend. <br />
Inhuman Scyron now has breath&#8217;d his last, <br />
And now Alcatho&#8217;s roads securely past; <br />
By Theseus slain, and thrown into the deep: <br />
But Earth nor Sea his scatter&#8217;d bones wou&#8217;d keep, <br />
Which, after floating long, a rock became, <br />
Still infamous with Scyron&#8217;s hated name. <br />
When Fame to count thy acts and years proceeds, <br />
Thy years appear but cyphers to thy deeds. <br />
For thee, brave youth, as for our common-wealth, <br />
We pray; and drink, in yours, the publick health. <br />
Your praise the senate, and plebeians sing, <br />
With your lov&#8217;d name the court, and cottage ring. <br />
You make our shepherds and our sailors glad, <br />
And not a house in this vast city&#8217;s sad.</p>
<p>But mortal bliss will never come sincere, <br />
Pleasure may lead, but grief brings up the rear; <br />
While for his sons&#8217; arrival, rev&#8217;ling joy <br />
Aegeus, and all his subjects does employ; <br />
While they for only costly feasts prepare, <br />
His neighb&#8217;ring monarch, Minos, threatens war: <br />
Weak in land-forces, nor by sea more strong, <br />
But pow&#8217;rful in a deep resented wrong <br />
For a son&#8217;s murder, arm&#8217;d with pious rage; <br />
Yet prudently before he would engage, <br />
To raise auxiliaries resolv&#8217;d to sail, <br />
And with the pow&#8217;rful princes to prevail.</p>
<p>First Anaphe, then proud Astypalaea gains, <br />
By presents that, and this by threats obtains: <br />
Low Mycone, Cymolus, chalky soil, <br />
Tall Cythnos, Scyros, flat Seriphos&#8217; isle; <br />
Paros, with marble cliffs afar display&#8217;d; <br />
Impregnable Sithonia; yet betray&#8217;d <br />
To a weak foe by a gold-admiring maid, <br />
Who, chang&#8217;d into a daw of sable hue, <br />
Still hoards up gold, and hides it from the view.</p>
<p>But as these islands chearfully combine, <br />
Others refuse t&#8217; embark in his design. <br />
Now leftward with an easy sail he bore, <br />
And prosp&#8217;rous passage to Oenopia&#8217;s shore; <br />
Oenopia once, but now Aegina call&#8217;d, <br />
And with his royal mother&#8217;s name install&#8217;d <br />
By Aeacus, under whose reign did spring <br />
The Myrmidons, and now their reigning king.</p>
<p>Down to the port, amidst the rabble, run <br />
The princes of the blood; with Telamon, <br />
Peleus the next, and Phocus the third son: <br />
Then Aeacus, altho&#8217; opprest with years, <br />
To ask the cause of their approach appears.</p>
<p>That question does the Gnossian&#8217;s grief renew, <br />
And sighs from his afflicted bosom drew; <br />
Yet after a short solemn respite made, <br />
The ruler of the hundred cities said:</p>
<p>Assist our arms, rais&#8217;d for a murder&#8217;d son, <br />
In this religious war no risque you&#8217;ll run: <br />
Revenge the dead- for who refuse to give <br />
Rest to their urns, unworthy are to live.</p>
<p>What you request, thus Aeacus replies, <br />
Not I, but truth and common faith denies; <br />
Athens and we have long been sworn allies: <br />
Our leagues are fix&#8217;d, confed&#8217;rate are our pow&#8217;rs, <br />
And who declare themselves their foes, are ours.</p>
<p>Minos rejoins, Your league shall dearly cost <br />
(Yet, mindful how much safer &#8217;twas to boast, <br />
Than there to waste his forces, and his fame, <br />
Before in field with his grand foe he came), <br />
Parts without blows- nor long had left the shore, <br />
E&#8217;re into port another navy bore, <br />
With Cephalus, and all his jolly crew; <br />
Th&#8217; Aeacides their old acquaintance knew: <br />
The princes bid him welcome, and in state <br />
Conduct the heroe to their palace gate; <br />
Who entr&#8217;ring, seem&#8217;d the charming mein to wear, <br />
As when in youth he paid his visit there. <br />
In his right hand an olive-branch he holds, <br />
And, salutation past, the chief unfolds <br />
His embassy from the Athenian state, <br />
Their mutual friendship, leagues of ancient date; <br />
Their common danger, ev&#8217;ry thing cou&#8217;d wake <br />
Concern, and his address successful make: <br />
Strength&#8217;ning his plea with all the charms of sense, <br />
And those, with all the charms of eloquence.</p>
<p>Then thus the king: Like suitors do you stand <br />
For that assistance which you may command? <br />
Athenians, all our listed forces use <br />
(They&#8217;re such as no bold service will refuse); <br />
And when y&#8217; ave drawn them off, the Gods be prais&#8217;d, <br />
Fresh legions can within our isle be rais&#8217;d: <br />
So stock&#8217;d with people, that we can prepare <br />
Both for domestick, and for distant war, <br />
Ours, or our friends&#8217; insulters to chastize.</p>
<p>Long may ye flourish thus, the prince replies. <br />
Strange transport seiz&#8217;d me as I pass&#8217;d along, <br />
To meet so many troops, and all so young, <br />
As if your army did of twins consist; <br />
Yet amongst them my late acquaintance miss&#8217;d: <br />
Ev&#8217;n all that to your palace did resort, <br />
When first you entertain&#8217;d me at your court; <br />
And cannot guess the cause from whence cou&#8217;d spring <br />
So vast a change- Then thus the sighing king:</p>
<p>Illustrious guest, to my strange tale attend, <br />
Of sad beginning, but a joyful end: <br />
The whole to a vast history wou&#8217;d swell, <br />
I shall but half, and that confus&#8217;dly, tell. <br />
That race whom so deserv&#8217;dly you admir&#8217;d, <br />
Are all into their silent tombs retir&#8217;d: <br />
They fell; and falling, how they shook my state, <br />
Thought may conceive, but words can ne&#8217;er relate.</p>
<p>The Story of Ants chang&#8217;d to Men</p>
<p>A dreadful plague from angry Juno came, <br />
To scourge the land, that bore her rival&#8217;s name; <br />
Before her fatal anger was reveal&#8217;d, <br />
And teeming malice lay as yet conceal&#8217;d, <br />
All remedies we try, all med&#8217;cines use, <br />
Which Nature cou&#8217;d supply, or art produce; <br />
Th&#8217; unconquer&#8217;d foe derides the vain design, <br />
And art, and Nature foil&#8217;d, declare the cause divine.</p>
<p>At first we only felt th&#8217; oppressive weight <br />
Of gloomy clouds, then teeming with our fate, <br />
And lab&#8217;ring to discarge unactive heat: <br />
But ere four moons alternate changes knew, <br />
With deadly blasts the fatal South-wind blew, <br />
Infected all the air, and poison&#8217;d as it flew. <br />
Our fountains too a dire infection yield, <br />
For crowds of vipers creep along the field, <br />
And with polluted gore, and baneful steams, <br />
Taint all the lakes, and venom all the streams.</p>
<p>The young disease with milder force began, <br />
And rag&#8217;d on birds, and beasts, excusing Man. <br />
The lab&#8217;ring oxen fall before the plow, <br />
Th&#8217; unhappy plow-men stare, and wonder how: <br />
The tabid sheep, with sickly bleatings, pines; <br />
Its wool decreasing, as its strength declines: <br />
The warlike steed, by inward foes compell&#8217;d, <br />
Neglects his honours, and deserts the field; <br />
Unnerv&#8217;d, and languid, seeks a base retreat, <br />
And at the manger groans, but wish&#8217;d a nobler fate: <br />
The stags forget their speed, the boars their rage, <br />
Nor can the bears the stronger herds engage: <br />
A gen&#8217;ral faintness does invade &#8216;em all, <br />
And in the woods, and fields, promiscuously they fall. <br />
The air receives the stench, and (strange to say) <br />
The rav&#8217;nous birds and beasts avoid the prey: <br />
Th&#8217; offensive bodies rot upon the ground, <br />
And spread the dire contagion all around.</p>
<p>But now the plague, grown to a larger size, <br />
Riots on Man, and scorns a meaner prize. <br />
Intestine heats begin the civil war, <br />
And flushings first the latent flame declare, <br />
And breath inspir&#8217;d, which seem&#8217;d like fiery air. <br />
Their black dry tongues are swell&#8217;d, and scarce can move, <br />
And short thick sighs from panting lung are drove. <br />
They gape for air, with flatt&#8217;ring hopes t&#8217; abate <br />
Their raging flames, but that augments their heat. <br />
No bed, no cov&#8217;ring can the wretches bear, <br />
But on the ground, expos&#8217;d to open air, <br />
They lye, and hope to find a pleasing coolness there. <br />
The suff&#8217;ring Earth with that oppression curst, <br />
Returns the heat which they imparted first.</p>
<p>In vain physicians would bestow their aid, <br />
Vain all their art, and useless all their trade; <br />
And they, ev&#8217;n they, who fleeting life recall, <br />
Feel the same Pow&#8217;rs, and undistinguish&#8217;d fall. <br />
If any proves so daring to attend <br />
His sick companion, or his darling friend, <br />
Th&#8217; officious wretch sucks in contagious breath, <br />
And with his friend does sympathize in death.</p>
<p>And now the care and hopes of life are past, <br />
They please their fancies, and indulge their taste; <br />
At brooks and streams, regardless of their shame, <br />
Each sex, promiscuous, strives to quench their flame; <br />
Nor do they strive in vain to quench it there, <br />
For thirst, and life at once extinguish&#8217;d are. <br />
Thus in the brooks the dying bodies sink, <br />
But heedless still the rash survivors drink.</p>
<p>So much uneasy down the wretches hate, <br />
They fly their beds, to struggle with their fate; <br />
But if decaying strength forbids to rise, <br />
The victim crawls and rouls, &#8217;till on the ground he lies. <br />
Each shuns his bed, as each wou&#8217;d shun his tomb, <br />
And thinks th&#8217; infection only lodg&#8217;d at home.</p>
<p>Here one, with fainting steps, does slowly creep <br />
O&#8217;er heaps of dead, and strait augments the heap; <br />
Another, while his strength and tongue prevail&#8217;d, <br />
Bewails his friend, and falls himself bewail&#8217;d: <br />
This with imploring looks surveys the skies, <br />
The last dear office of his closing eyes, <br />
But finds the Heav&#8217;ns implacable, and dies.</p>
<p>What now, ah! what employ&#8217;d my troubled mind? <br />
But only hopes my subjects&#8217; fate to find. <br />
What place soe&#8217;er my weeping eyes survey, <br />
There in lamented heaps the vulgar lay; <br />
As acorns scatter when the winds prevail, <br />
Or mellow fruit from shaken branches fall.</p>
<p>You see that dome which rears its front so high: <br />
&#8216;Tis sacred to the monarch of the sky: <br />
How many there, with unregarded tears, <br />
And fruitless vows, sent up successless pray&#8217;rs? <br />
There fathers for expiring sons implor&#8217;d, <br />
And there the wife bewail&#8217;d her gasping lord; <br />
With pious off&#8217;rings they&#8217;d appease the skies, <br />
But they, ere yet th&#8217; attoning vapours rise, <br />
Before the altars fall, themselves a sacrifice: <br />
They fall, while yet their hands the gums contain, <br />
The gums surviving, but their off&#8217;rers slain.</p>
<p>The destin&#8217;d ox, with holy garlands crown&#8217;d, <br />
Prevents the blow, and feels th&#8217; expected wound: <br />
When I my self invok&#8217;d the Pow&#8217;rs divine, <br />
To drive the fatal pest from me and mine; <br />
When now the priest with hands uplifted stood, <br />
Prepar&#8217;d to strike, and shed the sacred blood, <br />
The Gods themselves the mortal stroke bestow, <br />
The victim falls, but they impart the blow: <br />
Scarce was the knife with the pale purple stain&#8217;d, <br />
And no presages cou&#8217;d be then obtain&#8217;d, <br />
From putrid entrails, where th&#8217; infection reign&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Death stalk&#8217;d around with such resistless sway, <br />
The temples of the Gods his force obey, <br />
And suppliants feel his stroke, while yet they pray. <br />
Go now, said he, your deities implore <br />
For fruitless aid, for I defie their pow&#8217;r. <br />
Then with a curst malicious joy survey&#8217;d <br />
The very altars, stain&#8217;d with trophies of the dead.</p>
<p>The rest grown mad, and frantick with despair, <br />
Urge their own fate, and so prevent the fear. <br />
Strange madness that, when Death pursu&#8217;d so fast, <br />
T&#8217; anticipate the blow with impious haste.</p>
<p>No decent honours to their urns are paid, <br />
Nor cou&#8217;d the graves receive the num&#8217;rous dead; <br />
For, or they lay unbury&#8217;d on the ground, <br />
Or unadorn&#8217;d a needy fun&#8217;ral found: <br />
All rev&#8217;rence past, the fainting wretches fight <br />
For fun&#8217;ral piles which were another&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>Unmourn&#8217;d they fall: for, who surviv&#8217;d to mourn? <br />
And sires, and mothers unlamented burn: <br />
Parents, and sons sustain an equal fate, <br />
And wand&#8217;ring ghosts their kindred shadows meet. <br />
The dead a larger space of ground require, <br />
Nor are the trees sufficient for the fire.</p>
<p>Despairing under grief&#8217;s oppressive weight, <br />
And sunk by these tempestuous blasts of Fate, <br />
O Jove, said I, if common fame says true, <br />
If e&#8217;er Aegina gave those joys to you, <br />
If e&#8217;er you lay enclos&#8217;d in her embrace, <br />
Fond of her charms, and eager to possess; <br />
O father, if you do not yet disclaim <br />
Paternal care, nor yet disown the name; <br />
Grant my petitions, and with speed restore <br />
My subjects num&#8217;rous as they were before, <br />
Or make me partner of the fate they bore. <br />
I spoke, and glorious lightning shone around, <br />
And ratling thunder gave a prosp&#8217;rous sound; <br />
So let it be, and may these omens prove <br />
A pledge, said I, of your returning love.</p>
<p>By chance a rev&#8217;rend oak was near the place, <br />
Sacred to Jove, and of Dodona&#8217;s race, <br />
Where frugal ants laid up their winter meat, <br />
Whose little bodies bear a mighty weight: <br />
We saw them march along, and hide their store, <br />
And much admir&#8217;d their number, and their pow&#8217;r; <br />
Admir&#8217;d at first, but after envy&#8217;d more. <br />
Full of amazement, thus to Jove I pray&#8217;d, <br />
O grant, since thus my subjects are decay&#8217;d, <br />
As many subjects to supply the dead. <br />
I pray&#8217;d, and strange convulsions mov&#8217;d the oak, <br />
Which murmur&#8217;d, tho&#8217; by ambient winds unshook: <br />
My trembling hands, and stiff-erected hair, <br />
Exprest all tokens of uncommon fear; <br />
Yet both the earth and sacred oak I kist, <br />
And scarce cou&#8217;d hope, yet still I hop&#8217;d the best; <br />
For wretches, whatsoe&#8217;er the Fates divine, <br />
Expound all omens to their own design.</p>
<p>But now &#8217;twas night, when ev&#8217;n distraction wears <br />
A pleasing look, and dreams beguile our cares, <br />
Lo! the same oak appears before my eyes, <br />
Nor alter&#8217;d in his shape, nor former size; <br />
As many ants the num&#8217;rous branches bear, <br />
The same their labour, and their frugal care; <br />
The branches too a like commotion sound, <br />
And shook th&#8217; industrious creatures on the ground, <br />
Who, by degrees (what&#8217;s scarce to be believ&#8217;d) <br />
A nobler form, and larger bulk receiv&#8217;d, <br />
And on the earth walk&#8217;d an unusual pace, <br />
With manly strides, and an erected face- <br />
Their num&#8217;rous legs, and former colour lost, <br />
The insects cou&#8217;d a human figure boast.</p>
<p>I wake, and waking find my cares again, <br />
And to the unperforming Gods complain, <br />
And call their promise, and pretences, vain. <br />
Yet in my court I heard the murm&#8217;ring voice <br />
Of strangers, and a mixt uncommon noise: <br />
But I suspected all was still a dream, <br />
&#8216;Till Telamon to my apartment came, <br />
Op&#8217;ning the door with an impetuous haste, <br />
O come, said he, and see your faith and hopes surpast: <br />
I follow, and, confus&#8217;d with wonder, view <br />
Those shapes which my presaging slumbers drew: <br />
I saw, and own&#8217;d, and call&#8217;d them subjects; they <br />
Confest my pow&#8217;r, submissive to my sway. <br />
To Jove, restorer of my race decay&#8217;d, <br />
My vows were first with due oblations paid, <br />
I then divide with an impartial hand <br />
My empty city, and my ruin&#8217;d land, <br />
To give the new-born youth an equal share, <br />
And call them Myrmidons, from what they were. <br />
You saw their persons, and they still retain <br />
The thrift of ants, tho&#8217; now transform&#8217;d to men. <br />
A frugal people, and inur&#8217;d to sweat, <br />
Lab&#8217;ring to gain, and keeping what they get. <br />
These, equal both in strength and years, shall join <br />
Their willing aid, and follow your design, <br />
With the first southern gale that shall present <br />
To fill your sails, and favour your intent.</p>
<p>With such discourse they entertain the day; <br />
The ev&#8217;ning past in banquets, sport, and play: <br />
Then, having crown&#8217;d the night with sweet repose, <br />
Aurora (with the wind at east) arose. <br />
Now Pallas&#8217; sons to Cephalus resort, <br />
And Cephalus with Pallas&#8217; sons to court, <br />
To the king&#8217;s levee; him sleep&#8217;s silken chain, <br />
And pleasing dreams, beyond his hour detain; <br />
But then the princes of the blood, in state, <br />
Expect, and meet &#8216;em at the palace gate.</p>
<p>The Story of Cephalus and Procris</p>
<p>To th&#8217; inmost courts the Grecian youths were led, <br />
And plac&#8217;d by Phocus on a Tyrian bed; <br />
Who, soon observing Cephalus to hold <br />
A dart of unknown wood, but arm&#8217;d with gold: <br />
None better loves (said he) the huntsman&#8217;s sport, <br />
Or does more often to the woods resort; <br />
Yet I that jav&#8217;lin&#8217;s stem with wonder view, <br />
Too brown for box, too smooth a grain for yew. <br />
I cannot guess the tree; but never art <br />
Did form, or eyes behold so fair a dart! <br />
The guest then interrupts him- &#8216;Twou&#8217;d produce <br />
Still greater wonder, if you knew its use. <br />
It never fails to strike the game, and then <br />
Comes bloody back into your hand again. <br />
Then Phocus each particular desires, <br />
And th&#8217; author of the wond&#8217;rous gift enquires. <br />
To which the owner thus, with weeping eyes, <br />
And sorrow for his wife&#8217;s sad fate, replies, <br />
This weapon here (o prince!) can you believe <br />
This dart the cause for which so much I grieve; <br />
And shall continue to grieve on, &#8217;till Fate <br />
Afford such wretched life no longer date. <br />
Would I this fatal gift had ne&#8217;er enjoy&#8217;d, <br />
This fatal gift my tender wife destroy&#8217;d: <br />
Procris her name, ally&#8217;d in charms and blood <br />
To fair Orythia courted by a God. <br />
Her father seal&#8217;d my hopes with rites divine, <br />
But firmer love before had made her mine. <br />
Men call&#8217;d me blest, and blest I was indeed. <br />
The second month our nuptials did succeed; <br />
When (as upon Hymettus&#8217; dewy head, <br />
For mountain stags my net betimes I spread) <br />
Aurora spy&#8217;d, and ravish&#8217;d me away, <br />
With rev&#8217;rence to the Goddess, I must say, <br />
Against my will, for Procris had my heart, <br />
Nor wou&#8217;d her image from my thoughts depart. <br />
At last, in rage she cry&#8217;d, Ingrateful boy <br />
Go to your Procris, take your fatal joy; <br />
And so dismiss&#8217;d me: musing, as I went, <br />
What those expressions of the Goddess meant, <br />
A thousand jealous fears possess me now, <br />
Lest Procris had prophan&#8217;d her nuptial vow: <br />
Her youth and charms did to my fancy paint <br />
A lewd adultress, but her life a saint. <br />
Yet I was absent long, the Goddess too <br />
Taught me how far a woman cou&#8217;d be true. <br />
Aurora&#8217;s treatment much suspicion bred; <br />
Besides, who truly love, ev&#8217;n shadows dread. <br />
I strait impatient for the tryal grew, <br />
What courtship back&#8217;d with richest gifts cou&#8217;d do. <br />
Aurora&#8217;s envy aided my design, <br />
And lent me features far unlike to mine. <br />
In this disguise to my own house I came, <br />
But all was chaste, no conscious sign of blame: <br />
With thousand arts I scarce admittance found, <br />
And then beheld her weeping on the ground <br />
For her lost husband; hardly I retain&#8217;d <br />
My purpose, scarce the wish&#8217;d embrace refrain&#8217;d. <br />
How charming was her grief! Then, Phocus, guess <br />
What killing beauties waited on her dress. <br />
Her constant answer, when my suit I prest, <br />
Forbear, my lord&#8217;s dear image guards this breast; <br />
Where-e&#8217;er he is, whatever cause detains, <br />
Who-e&#8217;er has his, my heart unmov&#8217;d remains. <br />
What greater proofs of truth than these cou&#8217;d be? <br />
Yet I persist, and urge my destiny. <br />
At length, she found, when my own form return&#8217;d, <br />
Her jealous lover there, whose loss she mourn&#8217;d. <br />
Enrag&#8217;d with my suspicion, swift as wind, <br />
She fled at once from me and all mankind; <br />
And so became, her purpose to retain, <br />
A nymph, and huntress in Diana&#8217;s train: <br />
Forsaken thus, I found my flames encrease, <br />
I own&#8217;d my folly, and I su&#8217;d for peace. <br />
It was a fault, but not of guilt, to move <br />
Such punishment, a fault of too much love. <br />
Thus I retriev&#8217;d her to my longing arms, <br />
And many happy days possess&#8217;d her charms. <br />
But with herself she kindly did confer, <br />
What gifts the Goddess had bestow&#8217;d on her; <br />
The fleetest grey-hound, with this lovely dart, <br />
And I of both have wonders to impart. <br />
Near Thebes a savage beast, of race unknown, <br />
Laid waste the field, and bore the vineyards down; <br />
The swains fled from him, and with one consent <br />
Our Grecian youth to chase the monster went; <br />
More swift than light&#8217;ning he the toils surpast, <br />
And in his course spears, men, and trees o&#8217;er-cast. <br />
We slipt our dogs, and last my Lelaps too, <br />
When none of all the mortal race wou&#8217;d do: <br />
He long before was struggling from my hands, <br />
And, e&#8217;re we cou&#8217;d unloose him, broke his bands. <br />
That minute where he was, we cou&#8217;d not find, <br />
And only saw the dust he left behind. <br />
I climb&#8217;d a neighb&#8217;ring hill to view the chase, <br />
While in the plain they held an equal race; <br />
The savage now seems caught, and now by force <br />
To quit himself, nor holds the same strait course; <br />
But running counter, from the foe withdraws, <br />
And with short turning cheats his gaping jaws: <br />
Which he retrieves, and still so closely prest, <br />
You&#8217;d fear at ev&#8217;ry stretch he were possess&#8217;d; <br />
Yet for the gripe his fangs in vain prepare; <br />
The game shoots from him, and he chops the air. <br />
To cast my jav&#8217;lin then I took my stand; <br />
But as the thongs were fitting to my hand, <br />
While to the valley I o&#8217;er-look&#8217;d the wood, <br />
Before my eyes two marble statues stood; <br />
That, as pursu&#8217;d appearing at full stretch, <br />
This barking after, and at point to catch: <br />
Some God their course did with this wonder grace, <br />
That neither might be conquer&#8217;d in the chase. <br />
A sudden silence here his tongue supprest, <br />
He here stops short, and fain wou&#8217;d wave the rest.</p>
<p>The eager prince then urg&#8217;d him to impart, <br />
The Fortune that attended on the dart. <br />
First then (said he) past joys let me relate, <br />
For bliss was the foundation of my fate. <br />
No language can those happy hours express, <br />
Did from our nuptials me, and Procris bless: <br />
The kindest pair! What more cou&#8217;d Heav&#8217;n confer? <br />
For she was all to me, and I to her. <br />
Had Jove made love, great Jove had been despis&#8217;d; <br />
And I my Procris more than Venus priz&#8217;d: <br />
Thus while no other joy we did aspire, <br />
We grew at last one soul, and one desire. <br />
Forth to the woods I went at break of day <br />
(The constant practice of my youth) for prey: <br />
Nor yet for servant, horse, or dog did call, <br />
I found this single dart to serve for all. <br />
With slaughter tir&#8217;d, I sought the cooler shade, <br />
And winds that from the mountains pierc&#8217;d the glade: <br />
Come, gentle air (so was I wont to say) <br />
Come, gentle air, sweet Aura come away. <br />
This always was the burden of my song, <br />
Come &#8216;swage my flames, sweet Aura come along. <br />
Thou always art most welcome to my breast; <br />
I faint; approach, thou dearest, kindest guest! <br />
These blandishments, and more than these, I said <br />
(By Fate to unsuspected ruin led), <br />
Thou art my joy, for thy dear sake I love <br />
Each desart hill, and solitary grove; <br />
When (faint with labour) I refreshment need, <br />
For cordials on thy fragrant breath I feed. <br />
At last a wand&#8217;ring swain in hearing came, <br />
And cheated with the sound of Aura&#8217;s name, <br />
He thought I some assignation made; <br />
And to my Procris&#8217; ear the news convey&#8217;d. <br />
Great love is soonest with suspicion fir&#8217;d: <br />
She swoon&#8217;d, and with the tale almost expir&#8217;d. <br />
Ah! wretched heart! (she cry&#8217;d) ah! faithless man. <br />
And then to curse th&#8217; imagin&#8217;d nymph began: <br />
Yet oft she doubts, oft hopes she is deceiv&#8217;d, <br />
And chides herself, that ever she believ&#8217;d <br />
Her lord to such injustice cou&#8217;d proceed, <br />
&#8216;Till she her self were witness of the deed. <br />
Next morn I to the woods again repair, <br />
And, weary with the chase, invoke the air: <br />
Approach, dear Aura, and my bosom chear: <br />
At which a mournful sound did strike my ear; <br />
Yet I proceeded, &#8217;till the thicket by, <br />
With rustling noise and motion, drew my eye: <br />
I thought some beast of prey was shelter&#8217;d there, <br />
And to the covert threw my certain spear; <br />
From whence a tender sigh my soul did wound, <br />
Ah me! it cry&#8217;d, and did like Procris sound. <br />
Procris was there, too well the voice I knew, <br />
And to the place with headlong horror flew; <br />
Where I beheld her gasping on the ground, <br />
In vain attempting from the deadly wound <br />
To draw the dart, her love&#8217;s dear fatal gift! <br />
My guilty arms had scarce the strength to lift <br />
The beauteous load; my silks, and hair I tore <br />
(If possible) to stanch the pressing gore; <br />
For pity beg&#8217;d her keep her flitting breath, <br />
And not to leave me guilty of her death. <br />
While I intreat she fainted fast away, <br />
And these few words had only strength to say: <br />
By all the sacred bonds of plighted love, <br />
By all your rev&#8217;rence to the Pow&#8217;rs above, <br />
By all the truth for which you held me dear, <br />
And last by love, the cause through which I bleed, <br />
Let Aura never to my bed succeed. <br />
I then perceiv&#8217;d the error of our fate, <br />
And told it her, but found and told too late! <br />
I felt her lower to my bosom fall, <br />
And while her eyes had any sight at all, <br />
On mine she fix&#8217;d them; in her pangs still prest <br />
My hand, and sigh&#8217;d her soul into my breast; <br />
Yet, being undeceiv&#8217;d, resign&#8217;d her breath <br />
Methought more chearfully, and smil&#8217;d in death.</p>
<p>With such concern the weeping heroe told <br />
This tale, that none who heard him cou&#8217;d with-hold <br />
From melting into sympathizing tears, <br />
&#8216;Till Aeacus with his two sons appears; <br />
Whom he commits, with their new-levy&#8217;d bands, <br />
To Fortune&#8217;s, and so brave a gen&#8217;ral&#8217;s hands. </p>
