				<p>The Story of Achelous and Hercules</p>
<p>Theseus requests the God to tell his woes, <br />
Whence his maim&#8217;d brow, and whence his groans arose <br />
Whence thus the Calydonian stream reply&#8217;d, <br />
With twining reeds his careless tresses ty&#8217;d: <br />
Ungrateful is the tale; for who can bear, <br />
When conquer&#8217;d, to rehearse the shameful war? <br />
Yet I&#8217;ll the melancholy story trace; <br />
So great a conqu&#8217;ror softens the disgrace: <br />
Nor was it still so mean the prize to yield, <br />
As great, and glorious to dispute the field. <br />
Perhaps you&#8217;ve heard of Deianira&#8217;s name, <br />
For all the country spoke her beauty&#8217;s fame. <br />
Long was the nymph by num&#8217;rous suitors woo&#8217;d, <br />
Each with address his envy&#8217;d hopes pursu&#8217;d: <br />
I joyn&#8217;d the loving band; to gain the fair, <br />
Reveal&#8217;d my passion to her father&#8217;s ear. <br />
Their vain pretensions all the rest resign, <br />
Alcides only strove to equal mine; <br />
He boasts his birth from Jove, recounts his spoils, <br />
His step-dame&#8217;s hate subdu&#8217;d, and finish&#8217;d toils.</p>
<p>Can mortals then (said I), with Gods compare? <br />
Behold a God; mine is the watry care: <br />
Through your wide realms I take my mazy way, <br />
Branch into streams, and o&#8217;er the region stray: <br />
No foreign guest your daughter&#8217;s charms adores, <br />
But one who rises in your native shores. <br />
Let not his punishment your pity move; <br />
Is Juno&#8217;s hate an argument for love? <br />
Though you your life from fair Alcmena drew, <br />
Jove&#8217;s a feign&#8217;d father, or by fraud a true. <br />
Chuse then; confess thy mother&#8217;s honour lost, <br />
Or thy descent from Jove no longer boast.</p>
<p>While thus I spoke, he look&#8217;d with stern disdain, <br />
Nor could the sallies of his wrath restrain, <br />
Which thus break forth. This arm decides our right; <br />
Vanquish in words, be mine the prize in fight.</p>
<p>Bold he rush&#8217;d on. My honour to maintain, <br />
I fling my verdant garments on the plain, <br />
My arms stretch forth, my pliant limbs prepare, <br />
And with bent hands expect the furious war. <br />
O&#8217;er my sleek skin now gather&#8217;d dust he throws, <br />
And yellow sand his mighty muscles strows. <br />
Oft he my neck, and nimble legs assails, <br />
He seems to grasp me, but as often fails. <br />
Each part he now invades with eager hand; <br />
Safe in my bulk, immoveable I stand. <br />
So when loud storms break high, and foam and roar <br />
Against some mole that stretches from the shore; <br />
The firm foundation lasting tempests braves, <br />
Defies the warring winds, and driving waves.</p>
<p>A-while we breathe, then forward rush amain, <br />
Renew the combat, and our ground maintain; <br />
Foot strove with foot, I prone extend my breast, <br />
Hands war with hands, and forehead forehead prest. <br />
Thus have I seen two furious bulls engage, <br />
Inflam&#8217;d with equal love, and equal rage; <br />
Each claims the fairest heifer of the grove, <br />
And conquest only can decide their love: <br />
The trembling herds survey the fight from far, <br />
&#8216;Till victory decides th&#8217; important war. <br />
Three times in vain he strove my joints to wrest, <br />
To force my hold, and throw me from his breast; <br />
The fourth he broke my gripe, that clasp&#8217;d him round, <br />
Then with new force he stretch&#8217;d me on the ground; <br />
Close to my back the mighty burthen clung, <br />
As if a mountain o&#8217;er my limbs were flung. <br />
Believe my tale; nor do I, boastful, aim <br />
By feign&#8217;d narration to extol my fame. <br />
No sooner from his grasp I freedom get, <br />
Unlock my arms, that flow&#8217;d with trickling sweat, <br />
But quick he seized me, and renew&#8217;d the strife, <br />
As my exhausted bosom pants for life: <br />
My neck he gripes, my knee to earth he strains; <br />
I fall, and bite the sand with shame, and pains.</p>
<p>O&#8217;er-match&#8217;d in strength, to wiles, and arts I take, <br />
And slip his hold, in form of speckled snake; <br />
Who, when I wreath&#8217;d in spires my body round, <br />
Or show&#8217;d my forky tongue with hissing sound, <br />
Smiles at my threats: Such foes my cradle knew, <br />
He cries, dire snakes my infant hand o&#8217;erthrew; <br />
A dragon&#8217;s form might other conquests gain, <br />
To war with me you take that shape in vain. <br />
Art thou proportion&#8217;d to the Hydra&#8217;s length, <br />
Who by his wounds receiv&#8217;d augmented strength? <br />
He rais&#8217;d a hundred hissing heads in air; <br />
When one I lopt, up-sprung a dreadful pair. <br />
By his wounds fertile, and with slaughter strong, <br />
Singly I quell&#8217;d him, and stretch&#8217;d dead along. <br />
What canst thou do, a form precarious, prone, <br />
To rouse my rage with terrors not thy own? <br />
He said; and round my neck his hands he cast, <br />
And with his straining fingers wrung me fast; <br />
My throat he tortur&#8217;d, close as pincers clasp, <br />
In vain I strove to loose the forceful grasp.</p>
<p>Thus vanquish&#8217;d too, a third form still remains, <br />
Chang&#8217;d to a bull, my lowing fills the plains. <br />
Strait on the left his nervous arms were thrown <br />
Upon my brindled neck, and tugg&#8217;d it down; <br />
Then deep he struck my horn into the sand, <br />
And fell&#8217;d my bulk among the dusty land. <br />
Nor yet his fury cool&#8217;d; &#8216;twixt rage and scorn, <br />
From my maim&#8217;d front he tore the stubborn horn: <br />
This, heap&#8217;d with flow&#8217;rs, and fruits, the Naiads bear, <br />
Sacred to plenty, and the bounteous year.</p>
<p>He spoke; when lo, a beauteous nymph appears, <br />
Girt like Diana&#8217;s train, with flowing hairs; <br />
The horn she brings in which all Autumn&#8217;s stor&#8217;d, <br />
And ruddy apples for the second board.</p>
<p>Now morn begins to dawn, the sun&#8217;s bright fire <br />
Gilds the high mountains, and the youths retire; <br />
Nor stay&#8217;d they, &#8217;till the troubled stream subsides, <br />
And in its bounds with peaceful current glides. <br />
But Achelous in his oozy bed <br />
Deep hides his brow deform&#8217;d, and rustick head: <br />
No real wound the victor&#8217;s triumph show&#8217;d, <br />
But his lost honours griev&#8217;d the watry God; <br />
Yet ev&#8217;n that loss the willow&#8217;s leaves o&#8217;erspread, <br />
And verdant reeds, in garlands, bind his head.</p>
<p>The Death of Nessus the Centaur</p>
<p>This virgin too, thy love, O Nessus, found, <br />
To her alone you owe the fatal wound. <br />
As the strong son of Jove his bride conveys, <br />
Where his paternal lands their bulwarks raise; <br />
Where from her slopy urn, Evenus pours <br />
Her rapid current, swell&#8217;d by wintry show&#8217;rs, <br />
He came. The frequent eddies whirl&#8217;d the tide, <br />
And the deep rolling waves all pass deny&#8217;d. <br />
As for himself, he stood unmov&#8217;d by fears, <br />
For now his bridal charge employ&#8217;d his cares, <br />
The strong-limb&#8217;d Nessus thus officious cry&#8217;d <br />
(For he the shallows of the stream had try&#8217;d), <br />
Swim thou, Alcides, all thy strength prepare, <br />
On yonder bank I&#8217;ll lodge thy nuptial care.</p>
<p>Th&#8217; Aonian chief to Nessus trusts his wife, <br />
All pale, and trembling for her heroe&#8217;s life: <br />
Cloath&#8217;d as he stood in the fierce lion&#8217;s hide, <br />
The laden quiver o&#8217;er his shoulder ty&#8217;d <br />
(For cross the stream his bow and club were cast), <br />
Swift he plung&#8217;d in: These billows shall be past, <br />
He said, nor sought where smoother waters glide, <br />
But stem&#8217;d the rapid dangers of the tide. <br />
The bank he reach&#8217;d; again the bow he bears; <br />
When, hark! his bride&#8217;s known voice alarms his ears. <br />
Nessus, to thee I call (aloud he cries) <br />
Vain is thy trust in flight, be timely wise: <br />
Thou monster double-shap&#8217;d, my right set free; <br />
If thou no rev&#8217;rence owe my fame and me, <br />
Yet kindred should thy lawless lust deny; <br />
Think not, perfidious wretch, from me to fly, <br />
Tho&#8217; wing&#8217;d with horse&#8217;s speed; wounds shall pursue; <br />
Swift as his words the fatal arrow flew: <br />
The centaur&#8217;s back admits the feather&#8217;d wood, <br />
And thro&#8217; his breast the barbed weapon stood; <br />
Which when, in anguish, thro&#8217; the flesh he tore, <br />
From both the wounds gush&#8217;d forth the spumy gore <br />
Mix&#8217;d with Lernaean venom; this he took, <br />
Nor dire revenge his dying breast forsook. <br />
His garment, in the reeking purple dy&#8217;d, <br />
To rouse love&#8217;s passion, he presents the bride.</p>
<p>The Death of Hercules</p>
<p>Now a long interval of time succeeds, <br />
When the great son of Jove&#8217;s immortal deeds, <br />
And step-dame&#8217;s hate, had fill&#8217;d Earth&#8217;s utmost round; <br />
He from Oechalia, with new lawrels crown&#8217;d, <br />
In triumph was return&#8217;d. He rites prepares, <br />
And to the King of Gods directs his pray&#8217;rs; <br />
When Fame (who falshood cloaths in truth&#8217;s disguise, <br />
And swells her little bulk with growing lies) <br />
Thy tender ear, o Deianira, mov&#8217;d, <br />
That Hercules the fair Iole lov&#8217;d. <br />
Her love believes the tale; the truth she fears <br />
Of his new passion, and gives way to tears. <br />
The flowing tears diffus&#8217;d her wretched grief, <br />
Why seek I thus, from streaming eyes, relief? <br />
She cries; indulge not thus these fruitless cares, <br />
The harlot will but triumph in thy tears: <br />
Let something be resolv&#8217;d, while yet there&#8217;s time; <br />
My bed not conscious of a rival&#8217;s crime. <br />
In silence shall I mourn, or loud complain? <br />
Shall I seek Calydon, or here remain? <br />
What tho&#8217;, ally&#8217;d to Meleager&#8217;s fame, <br />
I boast the honours of a sister&#8217;s name? <br />
My wrongs, perhaps, now urge me to pursue <br />
Some desp&#8217;rate deed, by which the world shall view <br />
How far revenge, and woman&#8217;s rage can rise, <br />
When weltring in her blood the harlot dies.</p>
<p>Thus various passions rul&#8217;d by turns her breast, <br />
She now resolves to send the fatal vest, <br />
Dy&#8217;d with Lernaean gore, whose pow&#8217;r might move <br />
His soul anew, and rouse declining love. <br />
Nor knew she what her sudden rage bestows, <br />
When she to Lychas trusts her future woes; <br />
With soft endearments she the boy commands, <br />
To bear the garment to her husband&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>Th&#8217; unwitting hero takes the gift in haste, <br />
And o&#8217;er his shoulders Lerna&#8217;s poison cast, <br />
As first the fire with frankincense he strows, <br />
And utters to the Gods his holy vows; <br />
And on the marble altar&#8217;s polish&#8217;d frame <br />
Pours forth the grapy stream; the rising flame <br />
Sudden dissolves the subtle pois&#8217;nous juice, <br />
Which taints his blood, and all his nerves bedews. <br />
With wonted fortitude he bore the smart, <br />
And not a groan confess&#8217;d his burning heart. <br />
At length his patience was subdu&#8217;d by pain, <br />
He rends the sacred altar from the plain; <br />
Oete&#8217;s wide forests echo with his cries: <br />
Now to rip off the deathful robe he tries. <br />
Where-e&#8217;er he plucks the vest, the skin he tears, <br />
The mangled muscles, and huge bones he bares <br />
(A ghastful sight!), or raging with his pain, <br />
To rend the sticking plague he tugs in vain.</p>
<p>As the red iron hisses in the flood, <br />
So boils the venom in his curdling blood. <br />
Now with the greedy flame his entrails glow, <br />
And livid sweats down all his body flow; <br />
The cracking nerves burnt up are burst in twain, <br />
The lurking venom melts his swimming brain.</p>
<p>Then, lifting both his hands aloft, he cries, <br />
Glut thy revenge, dread Empress of the skies; <br />
Sate with my death the rancour of thy heart, <br />
Look down with pleasure, and enjoy my smart. <br />
Or, if e&#8217;er pity mov&#8217;d a hostile breast <br />
(For here I stand thy enemy profest), <br />
Take hence this hateful life, with tortures torn, <br />
Inur&#8217;d to trouble, and to labours born. <br />
Death is the gift most welcome to my woe, <br />
And such a gift a stepdame may bestow. <br />
Was it for this Busiris was subdu&#8217;d, <br />
Whose barb&#8217;rous temples reek&#8217;d with strangers&#8217; blood? <br />
Press&#8217;d in these arms his fate Antaeus found, <br />
Nor gain&#8217;d recruited vigour from the ground. <br />
Did I not triple-form&#8217;d Geryon fell? <br />
Or did I fear the triple dog of Hell? <br />
Did not these hands the bull&#8217;s arm&#8217;d forehead hold? <br />
Are not our mighty toils in Elis told? <br />
Do not Stymphalian lakes proclaim thy fame? <br />
And fair Parthenian woods resound thy name? <br />
Who seiz&#8217;d the golden belt of Thermodon? <br />
And who the dragon-guarded apples won? <br />
Could the fierce centaur&#8217;s strength my force withstand, <br />
Or the fell boar that spoil&#8217;d th&#8217; Arcadian land? <br />
Did not these arms the Hydra&#8217;s rage subdue, <br />
Who from his wounds to double fury grew? <br />
What if the Thracian horses, fat with gore, <br />
Who human bodies in their mangers tore, <br />
I saw, and with their barb&#8217;rous lord o&#8217;erthrew? <br />
What if these hands Nemaea&#8217;s lion slew? <br />
Did not this neck the heav&#8217;nly globe sustain? <br />
The female partner of the Thunderer&#8217;s reign <br />
Fatigu&#8217;d, at length suspends her harsh commands, <br />
Yet no fatigue hath slack&#8217;d these valiant hands. <br />
But now new plagues pursue me, neither force, <br />
Nor arms, nor darts can stop their raging course. <br />
Devouring flame thro&#8217; my rack&#8217;d entrails strays, <br />
And on my lungs and shrivel&#8217;d muscles preys. <br />
Yet still Eurystheus breathes the vital air. <br />
What mortal now shall seek the Gods with pray&#8217;r?</p>
<p>The Transformation of Lychas into a Rock</p>
<p>The hero said; and with the torture stung, <br />
Furious o&#8217;er Oete&#8217;s lofty hills he sprung. <br />
Stuck with the shaft, thus scours the tyger round, <br />
And seeks the flying author of his wound. <br />
Now might you see him trembling, now he vents <br />
His anguish&#8217;d soul in groans, and loud laments; <br />
He strives to tear the clinging vest in vain, <br />
And with up-rooted forests strows the plain; <br />
Now kindling into rage, his hands he rears, <br />
And to his kindred Gods directs his pray&#8217;rs. <br />
When Lychas, lo, he spies; who trembling flew, <br />
And in a hollow rock conceal&#8217;d from view, <br />
Had shun&#8217;d his wrath. Now grief renew&#8217;d his pain, <br />
His madness chaf&#8217;d, and thus he raves again.</p>
<p>Lychas, to thee alone my fate I owe, <br />
Who bore the gift, the cause of all my woe. <br />
The youth all pale, with shiv&#8217;ring fear was stung, <br />
And vain excuses falter&#8217;d on his tongue. <br />
Alcides snatch&#8217;d him, as with suppliant face <br />
He strove to clasp his knees, and beg for grace: <br />
He toss&#8217;d him o&#8217;er his head with airy course, <br />
And hurl&#8217;d with more than with an engine&#8217;s force; <br />
Far o&#8217;er th&#8217; Eubaean main aloof he flies, <br />
And hardens by degrees amid the skies. <br />
So showry drops, when chilly tempests blow, <br />
Thicken at first, then whiten into snow, <br />
In balls congeal&#8217;d the rolling fleeces bound, <br />
In solid hail result upon the ground. <br />
Thus, whirl&#8217;d with nervous force thro&#8217; distant air, <br />
The purple tide forsook his veins, with fear; <br />
All moisture left his limbs. Transform&#8217;d to stone, <br />
In ancient days the craggy flint was known; <br />
Still in the Eubaean waves his front he rears, <br />
Still the small rock in human form appears, <br />
And still the name of hapless Lychas bears.</p>
<p>The Apotheosis of Hercules</p>
<p>But now the hero of immortal birth <br />
Fells Oete&#8217;s forests on the groaning Earth; <br />
A pile he builds; to Philoctetes&#8217; care <br />
He leaves his deathful instruments of war; <br />
To him commits those arrows, which again <br />
Shall see the bulwarks of the Trojan reign. <br />
The son of Paean lights the lofty pyre, <br />
High round the structure climbs the greedy fire; <br />
Plac&#8217;d on the top, thy nervous shoulders spread <br />
With the Nemaean spoils, thy careless head <br />
Rais&#8217;d on a knotty club, with look divine, <br />
Here thou, dread hero, of celestial line, <br />
Wert stretch&#8217;d at ease; as when a chearful guest, <br />
Wine crown&#8217;d thy bowls, and flow&#8217;rs thy temples drest.</p>
<p>Now on all sides the potent flames aspire, <br />
And crackle round those limbs that mock the fire <br />
A sudden terror seiz&#8217;d th&#8217; immortal host, <br />
Who thought the world&#8217;s profess&#8217;d defender lost. <br />
This when the Thund&#8217;rer saw, with smiles he cries, <br />
&#8216;Tis from your fears, ye Gods, my pleasures rise; <br />
Joy swells my breast, that my all-ruling hand <br />
O&#8217;er such a grateful people boasts command, <br />
That you my suff&#8217;ring progeny would aid; <br />
Tho&#8217; to his deeds this just respect be paid, <br />
Me you&#8217;ve oblig&#8217;d. Be all your fears forborn, <br />
Th&#8217; Oetean fires do thou, great hero, scorn. <br />
Who vanquish&#8217;d all things, shall subdue the flame. <br />
That part alone of gross maternal frame <br />
Fire shall devour; while what from me he drew <br />
Shall live immortal, and its force subdue; <br />
That, when he&#8217;s dead, I&#8217;ll raise to realms above; <br />
May all the Pow&#8217;rs the righteous act approve. <br />
If any God dissent, and judge too great <br />
The sacred honours of the heav&#8217;nly seat, <br />
Ev&#8217;n he shall own his deeds deserve the sky, <br />
Ev&#8217;n he reluctant, shall at length comply. <br />
Th&#8217; assembled Pow&#8217;rs assent. No frown &#8217;till now <br />
Had mark&#8217;d with passion vengeful Juno&#8217;s brow, <br />
Mean-while whate&#8217;er was in the pow&#8217;r of flame <br />
Was all consum&#8217;d; his body&#8217;s nervous frame <br />
No more was known, of human form bereft, <br />
Th&#8217; eternal part of Jove alone was left. <br />
As an old serpent casts his scaly vest, <br />
Wreathes in the sun, in youthful glory drest; <br />
So when Alcides mortal mold resign&#8217;d, <br />
His better part enlarg&#8217;d, and grew refin&#8217;d; <br />
August his visage shone; almighty Jove <br />
In his swift carr his honour&#8217;d offspring drove; <br />
High o&#8217;er the hollow clouds the coursers fly, <br />
And lodge the hero in the starry sky.</p>
<p>The Transformation of Galanthis</p>
<p>Atlas perceiv&#8217;d the load of Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s new guest. <br />
Revenge still rancour&#8217;d in Eurystheus&#8217; breast <br />
Against Alcides&#8217; race. Alcmena goes <br />
To Iole, to vent maternal woes; <br />
Here she pours forth her grief, recounts the spoils <br />
Her son had bravely reap&#8217;d in glorious toils. <br />
This Iole, by Hercules&#8217; commands, <br />
Hyllus had lov&#8217;d, and joyn&#8217;d in nuptial bands. <br />
Her swelling womb the teeming birth confess&#8217;d, <br />
To whom Alcmena thus her speech address&#8217;d.</p>
<p>O, may the Gods protect thee, in that hour, <br />
When, &#8216;midst thy throws, thou call&#8217;st th&#8217; Ilithyan Pow&#8217;r! <br />
May no delays prolong thy racking pain, <br />
As when I su&#8217;d for Juno&#8217;s aid in vain.</p>
<p>When now Alcides&#8217; mighty birth drew nigh, <br />
And the tenth sign roll&#8217;d forward on the sky, <br />
My womb extends with such a mighty load, <br />
As Jove the parent of the burthen show&#8217;d. <br />
I could no more th&#8217; encreasing smart sustain, <br />
My horror kindles to recount the pain; <br />
Cold chills my limbs while I the tale pursue, <br />
And now methinks I feel my pangs anew. <br />
Seven days and nights amidst incessant throws, <br />
Fatigu&#8217;d with ills I lay, nor knew repose; <br />
When lifting high my hands, in shrieks I pray&#8217;d, <br />
Implor&#8217;d the Gods, and call&#8217;d Lucina&#8217;s aid. <br />
She came, but prejudic&#8217;d, to give my Fate <br />
A sacrifice to vengeful Juno&#8217;s hate. <br />
She hears the groaning anguish of my fits, <br />
And on the altar at my door she sits. <br />
O&#8217;er her left knee her crossing leg she cast, <br />
Then knits her fingers close, and wrings them fast: <br />
This stay&#8217;d the birth; in mutt&#8217;ring verse she pray&#8217;d, <br />
The mutt&#8217;ring verse th&#8217; unfinish&#8217;d birth delay&#8217;d. <br />
Now with fierce struggles, raging with my pain, <br />
At Jove&#8217;s ingratitude I rave in vain. <br />
How did I wish for death! such groans I sent, <br />
As might have made the flinty heart relent.</p>
<p>Now the Cadmeian matrons round me press, <br />
Offer their vows, and seek to bring redress; <br />
Among the Theban dames Galanthis stands, <br />
Strong limb&#8217;d, red hair&#8217;d, and just to my commands: <br />
She first perceiv&#8217;d that all these racking woes <br />
From the persisting hate of Juno rose. <br />
As here and there she pass&#8217;d, by chance she sees <br />
The seated Goddess; on her close-press&#8217;d knees <br />
Her fast-knit hands she leans; with chearful voice <br />
Galanthis cries, Whoe&#8217;er thou art, rejoyce, <br />
Congratulate the dame, she lies at rest, <br />
At length the Gods Alcmena&#8217;s womb have blest. <br />
Swift from her seat the startled Goddess springs, <br />
No more conceal&#8217;d, her hands abroad she flings; <br />
The charm unloos&#8217;d, the birth my pangs reliev&#8217;d; <br />
Galanthis&#8217; laughter vex&#8217;d the Pow&#8217;r deceiv&#8217;d. <br />
Fame says, the Goddess dragg&#8217;d the laughing maid <br />
Fast by the hair; in vain her force essay&#8217;d <br />
Her grov&#8217;ling body from the ground to rear; <br />
Chang&#8217;d to fore-feet her shrinking arms appear: <br />
Her hairy back her former hue retains, <br />
The form alone is lost; her strength remains; <br />
Who, since the lye did from her mouth proceed, <br />
Shall from her pregnant mouth bring forth her breed; <br />
Nor shall she quit her long-frequented home, <br />
But haunt those houses where she lov&#8217;d to roam.</p>
<p>The Fable of Dryope</p>
<p>She said, and for her lost Galanthis sighs; <br />
When the fair consort of her son replies; <br />
Since you a servant&#8217;s ravish&#8217;d form bemoan, <br />
And kindly sigh for sorrows not your own, <br />
Let me (if tears and grief permit) relate <br />
A nearer woe, a sister&#8217;s stranger fate.</p>
<p>No nymph of all Oechaloa could compare <br />
For beauteous form with Dryope the fair; <br />
Her tender mother&#8217;s only hope and pride <br />
(My self the offspring of a second bride), <br />
This nymph, compress&#8217;d by him who rules the day, <br />
Whom Delphi, and the Delian isle obey, <br />
Andraemon lov&#8217;d; and blest in all those charms <br />
That pleas&#8217;d a God, succeeded to her arms.</p>
<p>A lake there was, with shelving banks around, <br />
Whose verdant summit fragrant myrtles crown&#8217;d. <br />
Those shades, unknowing of the fates, she sought; <br />
And to the Naiads flow&#8217;ry garlands brought; <br />
Her smiling babe (a pleasing charge) she prest <br />
Between her arms, and nourish&#8217;d at her breast. <br />
Not distant far a watry lotos grows; <br />
The Spring was new, and all the verdant boughs, <br />
Acorn&#8217;d with blossoms, promis&#8217;d fruits that vye <br />
In glowing colours with the Tyrian dye. <br />
Of these she cropt, to please her infant son, <br />
And I my self the same rash act had done, <br />
But, lo! I saw (as near her side I stood) <br />
The violated blossoms drop with blood; <br />
Upon the tree I cast a frightful look, <br />
The trembling tree with sudden horror shook. <br />
Lotis the nymph (if rural tales be true) <br />
As from Priapus&#8217; lawless lust she flew, <br />
Forsook her form; and fixing here became <br />
A flow&#8217;ry plant, which still preserves her name.</p>
<p>This change unknown, astonish&#8217;d at the sight, <br />
My trembling sister strove to urge her flight; <br />
Yet first the pardon of the Nymphs implor&#8217;d, <br />
And those offended Sylvan pow&#8217;rs ador&#8217;d: <br />
But when she backward would have fled, she found <br />
Her stiff&#8217;ning feet were rooted to the ground: <br />
In vain to free her fasten&#8217;d feet she strove, <br />
And as she struggles only moves above; <br />
She feels th&#8217; incroaching bark around her grow, <br />
By slow degrees, and cover all below: <br />
Surpriz&#8217;d at this, her trembling hand she heaves <br />
To rend her hair; her hand is fill&#8217;d with leaves; <br />
Where late was hair, the shooting leaves are seen <br />
To rise, and shade her with a sudden green. <br />
The Child Amphisus, to her bosom prest, <br />
Perceiv&#8217;d a colder and a harder breast, <br />
And found the springs, that n&#8217;er &#8217;till then deny&#8217;d <br />
Their milky moisture, on a sudden dry&#8217;d. <br />
I saw, unhappy, what I now relate, <br />
And stood the helpless witness of thy fate; <br />
Embrac&#8217;d thy boughs, the rising bark delay&#8217;d, <br />
There wish&#8217;d to grow, and mingle shade with shade.</p>
<p>Behold Andraemon, and th&#8217; unhappy sire <br />
Appear, and for their Dryope enquire; <br />
A springing tree for Dryope they find, <br />
And print warm kisses on the panting rind; <br />
Prostrate, with tears their kindred plant bedew, <br />
And close embrac&#8217;d, as to the roots they grew; <br />
The face was all that now remain&#8217;d of thee; <br />
No more a woman, nor yet quite a tree: <br />
Thy branches hung with humid pearls appear, <br />
From ev&#8217;ry leaf distills a trickling tear; <br />
And strait a voice, while yet a voice remains, <br />
Thus thro&#8217; the trembling boughs in sighs complains.</p>
<p>If to the wretched any faith be giv&#8217;n, <br />
I swear by all th&#8217; unpitying Pow&#8217;rs of Heav&#8217;n, <br />
No wilful crime this heavy vengeance bred, <br />
In mutual innocence our lives we led. <br />
If this be false, let these new greens decay, <br />
Let sounding axes lop my limbs away, <br />
And crackling flames on all my honours prey. <br />
Now from my branching arms this infant bear, <br />
Let some kind nurse supply a mother&#8217;s care; <br />
Yet to his mother let him oft be led, <br />
Sport in her shades, and in her shades be fed; <br />
Teach him, when first his infant voice shall frame <br />
Imperfect words, and lisp his mother&#8217;s name, <br />
To hail this tree, and say with weeping eyes, <br />
Within this plant my hapless parent lies; <br />
And when in youth he seeks the shady woods, <br />
Oh, let him fly the chrystal lakes and floods, <br />
Nor touch the fatal flow&#8217;rs; but warn&#8217;d by me, <br />
Believe a Goddess shrin&#8217;d in ev&#8217;ry tree. <br />
My sire, my sister, and my spouse farewel! <br />
If in your breasts or love, or pity, dwell, <br />
Protect your plant, nor let my branches feel <br />
The browzing cattle, or the piercing steel. <br />
Farewel! and since I cannot bend to join <br />
My lips to yours, advance at least to mine. <br />
My son, thy mother&#8217;s parting kiss receive, <br />
While yet thy mother has a kiss to give. <br />
I can no more; the creeping rind invades <br />
My closing lips, and hides my head in shades: <br />
Remove your hands; the bark shall soon suffice, <br />
Without their aid, to seal these dying eyes. <br />
She ceas&#8217;d at once to speak, and ceas&#8217;d to be; <br />
And all the nymph was lost within the tree: <br />
Yet latent life thro&#8217; her new branches reign&#8217;d, <br />
And long the plant a human heat retain&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Iolaus restor&#8217;d to Youth</p>
<p>While Iole the fatal change declares, <br />
Alcmena&#8217;s pitying hand oft wip&#8217;d her tears. <br />
Grief too stream&#8217;d down her cheeks; soon sorrow flies, <br />
And rising joy the trickling moisture dries, <br />
Lo Iolaus stands before their eyes. <br />
A youth he stood; and the soft down began <br />
O&#8217;er his smooth chin to spread, and promise man. <br />
Hebe submitted to her husband&#8217;s pray&#8217;rs, <br />
Instill&#8217;d new vigour, and restor&#8217;d his years.</p>
<p>The Prophecy of Themis</p>
<p>Now from her lips a solemn oath had past, <br />
That Iolaus this gift alone shou&#8217;d taste, <br />
Had not just Themis thus maturely said <br />
(Which check&#8217;d her vow, and aw&#8217;d the blooming maid).</p>
<p>Thebes is embroil&#8217;d in war. Capaneus stands <br />
Invincible, but by the Thund&#8217;rer&#8217;s hands. <br />
Ambition shall the guilty brothers fire, <br />
Both rush to mutual wounds, and both expire. <br />
The reeling Earth shall ope her gloomy womb, <br />
Where the yet breathing bard shall find his tomb. <br />
The son shall bath his hands in parents&#8217; blood, <br />
And in one act be both unjust, and good. <br />
Of home, and sense depriv&#8217;d, where-e&#8217;er he flies, <br />
The Furies, and his mother&#8217;s ghost he spies. <br />
His wife the fatal bracelet shall implore, <br />
And Phegeus stain his sword in kindred gore. <br />
Callirhoe shall then with suppliant pray&#8217;r <br />
Prevail on Jupiter&#8217;s relenting ear. <br />
Jove shall with youth her infant sons inspire, <br />
And bid their bosoms glow with manly fire.</p>
<p>The Debate of the Gods</p>
<p>When Themis thus with prescient voice had spoke, <br />
Among the Gods a various murmur broke; <br />
Dissention rose in each immortal breast, <br />
That one should grant, what was deny&#8217;d the rest. <br />
Aurora for her aged spouse complains, <br />
And Ceres grieves for Jason&#8217;s freezing veins; <br />
Vulcan would Erichthonius&#8217; years renew, <br />
Her future race the care of Venus drew, <br />
She would Anchises&#8217; blooming age restore; <br />
A diff&#8217;rent care employ&#8217;d each heav&#8217;nly Pow&#8217;r: <br />
Thus various int&#8217;rests did their jars encrease, <br />
&#8216;Till Jove arose; he spoke, their tumults cease.</p>
<p>Is any rev&#8217;rence to our presence giv&#8217;n, <br />
Then why this discord &#8216;mong the Pow&#8217;rs of Heav&#8217;n? <br />
Who can the settled will of Fate subdue? <br />
&#8216;Twas by the Fates that Iolaus knew <br />
A second youth. The Fates&#8217; determin&#8217;d doom <br />
Shall give Callirhoe&#8217;s race a youthful bloom. <br />
Arms, nor ambition can this pow&#8217;r obtain; <br />
Quell your desires; ev&#8217;n me the Fates restrain. <br />
Could I their will controul, no rolling years <br />
Had Aeacus bent down with silver hairs; <br />
Then Rhadamanthus still had youth possess&#8217;d, <br />
And Minos with eternal bloom been bless&#8217;d. <br />
Jove&#8217;s words the synod mov&#8217;d; the Pow&#8217;rs give o&#8217;er, <br />
And urge in vain unjust complaint no more. <br />
Since Rhadamanthus&#8217; veins now slowly flow&#8217;d, <br />
And Aeacus, and Minos bore the load; <br />
Minos, who in the flow&#8217;r of youth, and fame, <br />
Made mighty nations tremble at his name, <br />
Infirm with age, the proud Miletus fears, <br />
Vain of his birth, and in the strength of years, <br />
And now regarding all his realms as lost, <br />
He durst not force him from his native coast. <br />
But you by choice, Miletus, fled his reign, <br />
And thy swift vessel plow&#8217;d th&#8217; Aegean main; <br />
On Asiatick shores a town you frame, <br />
Which still is honour&#8217;d with the founder&#8217;s name. <br />
Here you Cyanee knew, the beauteous maid, <br />
As on her father&#8217;s winding banks she stray&#8217;d: <br />
Caunus and Byblis hence their lineage trace, <br />
The double offspring of your warm embrace.</p>
<p>The Passion of of Byblis</p>
<p>Let the sad fate of wretched Byblis prove <br />
A dismal warning to unlawful love; <br />
One birth gave being to the hapless pair, <br />
But more was Caunus than a sister&#8217;s care; <br />
Unknown she lov&#8217;d, for yet the gentle fire <br />
Rose not in flames, nor kindled to desire, <br />
&#8216;Twas thought no sin to wonder at his charms, <br />
Hang on his neck, and languish in his arms; <br />
Thus wing&#8217;d with joy, fled the soft hours away, <br />
And all the fatal guilt on harmless Nature lay.</p>
<p>But love (too soon from piety declin&#8217;d) <br />
Insensibly deprav&#8217;d her yielding mind. <br />
Dress&#8217;d she appears, with nicest art adorn&#8217;d, <br />
And ev&#8217;ry youth, but her lov&#8217;d brother, scorn&#8217;d; <br />
For him alone she labour&#8217;d to be fair, <br />
And curst all charms that might with hers compare. <br />
&#8216;Twas she, and only she, must Caunus please, <br />
Sick at her heart, yet knew not her disease: <br />
She call&#8217;d him lord, for brother was a name <br />
Too cold, and dull for her aspiring flame; <br />
And when he spoke, if sister he reply&#8217;d, <br />
For Byblis change that frozen word, she cry&#8217;d. <br />
Yet waking still she watch&#8217;d her strugling breast, <br />
And love&#8217;s approaches were in vain address&#8217;d, <br />
&#8216;Till gentle sleep an easy conquest made, <br />
And in her soft embrace the conqueror was laid. <br />
But oh too soon the pleasing vision fled, <br />
And left her blushing on the conscious bed: <br />
Ah me! (she cry&#8217;d) how monstrous do I seem? <br />
Why these wild thoughts? and this incestuous dream? <br />
Envy herself (&#8217;tis true) must own his charms, <br />
But what is beauty in a sister&#8217;s arms? <br />
Oh were I not that despicable she, <br />
How bless&#8217;d, how pleas&#8217;d, how happy shou&#8217;d I be! <br />
But unregarded now must bear my pain, <br />
And but in dreams, my wishes can obtain.</p>
<p>O sea-born Goddess! with thy wanton boy! <br />
Was ever such a charming scene of joy? <br />
Such perfect bliss! such ravishing delight! <br />
Ne&#8217;er hid before in the kind shades of night. <br />
How pleas&#8217;d my heart! in what sweet raptures tost! <br />
Ev&#8217;n life it self in the soft combat lost, <br />
While breathless he on my heav&#8217;d bosom lay, <br />
And snatch&#8217;d the treasures of my soul away.</p>
<p>If the bare fancy so affects my mind, <br />
How shou&#8217;d I rave if to the substance join&#8217;d? <br />
Oh, gentle Caunus! quit thy hated line, <br />
Or let thy parents be no longer mine! <br />
Oh that in common all things were enjoy&#8217;d, <br />
But those alone who have our hopes destroy&#8217;d. <br />
Were I a princess, thou an humble swain, <br />
The proudest kings shou&#8217;d rival thee in vain. <br />
It cannot be, alas! the dreadful ill <br />
Is fix&#8217;d by Fate, and he&#8217;s my brother still. <br />
Hear me, ye Gods! I must have friends in Heav&#8217;n, <br />
For Jove himself was to a sister giv&#8217;n: <br />
But what are their prerogatives above, <br />
To the short liberties of human love? <br />
Fantastick thoughts! down, down, forbidden fires, <br />
Or instant death extinguish my desires. <br />
Strict virtue, then, with thy malicious leave, <br />
Without a crime I may a kiss receive: <br />
But say shou&#8217;d I in spight of laws comply, <br />
Yet cruel Caunus might himself deny, <br />
No pity take of an afflicted maid <br />
(For love&#8217;s sweet game must be by couples play&#8217;d). <br />
Yet why shou&#8217;d youth, and charms like mine, despair? <br />
Such fears ne&#8217;er startled the Aeolian pair; <br />
No ties of blood could their full hopes destroy, <br />
They broke thro&#8217; all, for the prevailing joy; <br />
And who can tell but Caunus too may be <br />
Rack&#8217;d and tormented in his breast for me? <br />
Like me, to the extreamest anguish drove, <br />
Like me, just waking from a dream of love? <br />
But stay! Oh whither wou&#8217;d my fury run! <br />
What arguments I urge to be undone! <br />
Away fond Byblis, quench these guilty flames; <br />
Caunus thy love but as brother claims; <br />
Yet had he first been touch&#8217;d with love of me, <br />
The charming youth cou&#8217;d I despairing see? <br />
Oppress&#8217;d with grief, and dying by disdain? <br />
Ah no! too sure I shou&#8217;d have eas&#8217;d his pain! <br />
Since then, if Caunus ask&#8217;d me, it were done; <br />
Asking my self, what dangers can I run? <br />
But canst thou ask? and see that right betray&#8217;d, <br />
From Pyrrha down to thy whole sex convey&#8217;d? <br />
That self-denying gift we all enjoy, <br />
Of wishing to be won, yet seeming to be coy. <br />
Well then, for once, let a fond mistress woo; <br />
The force of love no custom can subdue; <br />
This frantick passion he by words shall know, <br />
Soft as the melting heart from whence they flow. <br />
The pencil then in her fair hand she held, <br />
By fear discourag&#8217;d, but by love compell&#8217;d <br />
She writes, then blots, writes on, and blots again, <br />
Likes it as fit, then razes it as vain: <br />
Shame, and assurance in her face appear, <br />
And a faint hope just yielding to despair; <br />
Sister was wrote, and blotted as a word <br />
Which she, and Caunus too (she hop&#8217;d) abhorr&#8217;d; <br />
But now resolv&#8217;d to be no more controul&#8217;d <br />
By scrup&#8217;lous virtue, thus her grief she told.</p>
<p>Thy lover (gentle Caunus) wishes thee <br />
That health, which thou alone canst give to me. <br />
O charming youth! the gift I ask bestow, <br />
Ere thou the name of the fond writer know; <br />
To thee without a name I would be known, <br />
Since knowing that, my frailty I must own. <br />
Yet why shou&#8217;d I my wretched name conceal? <br />
When thousand instances my flames reveal: <br />
Wan looks, and weeping eyes have spoke my pain, <br />
And sighs discharg&#8217;d from my heav&#8217;d heart in vain; <br />
Had I not wish&#8217;d my passion might be seen, <br />
What cou&#8217;d such fondness and embraces mean? <br />
Such kisses too! (Oh heedless lovely boy) <br />
Without a crime no sister cou&#8217;d enjoy: <br />
Yet (tho&#8217; extreamest rage has rack&#8217;d my soul, <br />
And raging fires in my parch&#8217;d bosom roul) <br />
Be witness, Gods! how piously I strove, <br />
To rid my thoughts of this enchanting love. <br />
But who cou&#8217;d scape so fierce, and sure a dart, <br />
Aim&#8217;d at a tender, and defenceless heart? <br />
Alas! what maid cou&#8217;d suffer, I have born, <br />
Ere the dire secret from my breast was torn; <br />
To thee a helpless vanquish&#8217;d wretch I come, <br />
&#8216;Tis you alone can save, or give my doom; <br />
My life, or death this moment you may chuse. <br />
Yet think, oh think, no hated stranger sues, <br />
No foe; but one, alas! too near ally&#8217;d, <br />
And wishing still much nearer to be ty&#8217;d. <br />
The forms of decency let age debate, <br />
And virtue&#8217;s rules by their cold morals state; <br />
Their ebbing joys give leisure to enquire, <br />
And blame those noble flights our youth inspire: <br />
Where Nature kindly summons let us go, <br />
Our sprightly years no bounds in love shou&#8217;d know, <br />
Shou&#8217;d feel no check of guilt, and fear no ill; <br />
Lovers, and Gods act all things at their will: <br />
We gain one blessing from our hated kin, <br />
Since our paternal freedom hides the sin; <br />
Uncensur&#8217;d in each other&#8217;s arms we lye, <br />
Think then how easie to compleat our joy. <br />
Oh, pardon and oblige a blushing maid, <br />
Whose rage the pride of her vain sex betray&#8217;d; <br />
Nor let my tomb thus mournfully complain, <br />
Here Byblis lies, by her lov&#8217;d Caunus slain.</p>
<p>Forc&#8217;d here to end, she with a falling tear <br />
Temper&#8217;d the pliant wax, which did the signet bear: <br />
The curious cypher was impress&#8217;d by art, <br />
But love had stamp&#8217;d one deeper in her heart; <br />
Her page, a youth of confidence, and skill, <br />
(Secret as night) stood waiting on her will; <br />
Sighing (she cry&#8217;d): Bear this, thou faithful boy, <br />
To my sweet partner in eternal joy: <br />
Here a long pause her secret guilt confess&#8217;d, <br />
And when at length she would have spoke the rest, <br />
Half the dear name lay bury&#8217;d in her breast.</p>
<p>Thus as he listned to her vain command, <br />
Down fell the letter from her trembling hand. <br />
The omen shock&#8217;d her soul. Yet go, she cry&#8217;d; <br />
Can a request from Byblis be deny&#8217;d?</p>
<p>To the Maeandrian youth this message&#8217;s born, <br />
The half-read lines by his fierce rage were torn; <br />
Hence, hence, he cry&#8217;d, thou pandar to her lust, <br />
Bear hence the triumph of thy impious trust: <br />
Thy instant death will but divulge her shame, <br />
Or thy life&#8217;s blood shou&#8217;d quench the guilty flame. <br />
Frighted, from threatning Caunus he withdrew, <br />
And with the dreadful news to his lost mistress flew. <br />
The sad repulse so struck the wounded fair, <br />
Her sense was bury&#8217;d in her wild despair; <br />
Pale was her visage, as the ghastly dead; <br />
And her scar&#8217;d soul from the sweet mansion fled; <br />
Yet with her life renew&#8217;d, her love returns, <br />
And faintly thus her cruel fate she mourns: <br />
&#8216;Tis just, ye Gods! was my false reason blind? <br />
To write a secret of this tender kind? <br />
With female craft I shou&#8217;d at first have strove, <br />
By dubious hints to sound his distant love; <br />
And try&#8217;d those useful, tho&#8217; dissembled, arts, <br />
Which women practise on disdainful hearts: <br />
I shou&#8217;d have watch&#8217;d whence the black storm might rise; <br />
Ere I had trusted the unfaithful skies. <br />
Now on the rouling billows I am tost, <br />
And with extended sails, on the blind shelves am lost. <br />
Did not indulgent Heav&#8217;n my doom foretell, <br />
When from my hand the fatal letter fell? <br />
What madness seiz&#8217;d my soul? and urg&#8217;d me on <br />
To take the only course to be undone? <br />
I cou&#8217;d my self have told the moving tale <br />
With such alluring grace as must prevail; <br />
Then had his eyes beheld my blushing fears, <br />
My rising sighs, and my descending tears; <br />
Round his dear neck these arms I then had spread, <br />
And, if rejected, at his feet been dead: <br />
If singly these had not his thoughts inclin&#8217;d, <br />
Yet all united would have shock&#8217;d his mind. <br />
Perhaps, my careless page might be in fault, <br />
And in a luckless hour the fatal message brought; <br />
Business, and worldly thoughts might fill his breast, <br />
Sometimes ev&#8217;n love itself may be an irksome guest: <br />
He cou&#8217;d not else have treated me with scorn, <br />
For Caunus was not of a tygress born; <br />
Nor steel, nor adamant has fenc&#8217;d his heart; <br />
Like mine, &#8217;tis naked to the burning dart.</p>
<p>Away false fears! he must, he shall be mine; <br />
In death alone I will my claim resign; <br />
&#8216;Tis vain to wish my written crime unknown, <br />
And for my guilt much vainer to atone. <br />
Repuls&#8217;d and baffled, fiercer still she burns, <br />
And Caunus with disdain her impious love returns. <br />
He saw no end of her injurious flame, <br />
And fled his country to avoid the shame. <br />
Forsaken Byblis, who had hopes no more; <br />
Burst out in rage, and her loose robes she tore; <br />
With her fair hands she smote her tender breast, <br />
And to the wond&#8217;ring world her love confess&#8217;d; <br />
O&#8217;er hills and dales, o&#8217;er rocks and streams she flew, <br />
But still in vain did her wild lust pursue: <br />
Wearied at length, on the cold earth she fell, <br />
And now in tears alone could her sad story tell. <br />
Relenting Gods in pity fix&#8217;d her there, <br />
And to a fountain turn&#8217;d the weeping fair.</p>
<p>The Fable of Iphis and Ianthe</p>
<p>The fame of this, perhaps, thro&#8217; Crete had flown: <br />
But Crete had newer wonders of her own, <br />
In Iphis chang&#8217;d; for, near the Gnossian bounds <br />
(As loud report the miracle resounds), <br />
At Phaestus dwelt a man of honest blood, <br />
But meanly born, and not so rich as good; <br />
Esteem&#8217;d, and lov&#8217;d by all the neighbourhood; <br />
Who to his wife, before the time assign&#8217;d <br />
For child-birth came, thus bluntly spoke his mind. <br />
If Heav&#8217;n, said Lygdus, will vouchsafe to hear, <br />
I have but two petitions to prefer; <br />
Short pains for thee, for me a son and heir. <br />
Girls cost as many throes in bringing forth; <br />
Beside, when born, the titts are little worth; <br />
Weak puling things, unable to sustain <br />
Their share of labour, and their bread to gain. <br />
If, therefore, thou a creature shalt produce, <br />
Of so great charges, and so little use <br />
(Bear witness, Heav&#8217;n, with what reluctancy), <br />
Her hapless innocence I doom to die. <br />
He said, and common tears the common grief display, <br />
Of him who bad, and her who must obey.</p>
<p>Yet Telethusa still persists, to find <br />
Fit arguments to move a father&#8217;s mind; <br />
T&#8217; extend his wishes to a larger scope, <br />
And in one vessel not confine his hope. <br />
Lygdus continues hard: her time drew near, <br />
And she her heavy load could scarcely bear; <br />
When slumbring, in the latter shades of night, <br />
Before th&#8217; approaches of returning light, <br />
She saw, or thought she saw, before her bed, <br />
A glorious train, and Isis at their head: <br />
Her moony horns were on her forehead plac&#8217;d, <br />
And yellow shelves her shining temples grac&#8217;d: <br />
A mitre, for a crown, she wore on high; <br />
The dog, and dappl&#8217;d bull were waiting by; <br />
Osyris, sought along the banks of Nile; <br />
The silent God: the sacred crocodile; <br />
And, last, a long procession moving on, <br />
With timbrels, that assist the lab&#8217;ring moon. <br />
Her slumbers seem&#8217;d dispell&#8217;d, and, broad awake, <br />
She heard a voice, that thus distinctly spake. <br />
My votary, thy babe from death defend, <br />
Nor fear to save whate&#8217;er the Gods will send. <br />
Delude with art thy husband&#8217;s dire decree: <br />
When danger calls, repose thy trust on me: <br />
And know thou hast not serv&#8217;d a thankless deity. <br />
This promise made, with night the Goddess fled; <br />
With joy the woman wakes, and leaves her bed; <br />
Devoutly lifts her spotless hands on high, <br />
And prays the Pow&#8217;rs their gift to ratifie.</p>
<p>Now grinding pains proceed to bearing throes, <br />
&#8216;Till its own weight the burden did disclose. <br />
&#8216;Twas of the beauteous kind, and brought to light <br />
With secrecy, to shun the father&#8217;s sight. <br />
Th&#8217; indulgent mother did her care employ, <br />
And past it on her husband for a boy. <br />
The nurse was conscious of the fact alone; <br />
The father paid his vows as for a son; <br />
And call&#8217;d him Iphis, by a common name, <br />
Which either sex with equal right may claim. <br />
Iphis his grandsire was; the wife was pleas&#8217;d, <br />
Of half the fraud by Fortune&#8217;s favour eas&#8217;d: <br />
The doubtful name was us&#8217;d without deceit, <br />
And truth was cover&#8217;d with a pious cheat. <br />
The habit show&#8217;d a boy, the beauteous face <br />
With manly fierceness mingled female grace.</p>
<p>Now thirteen years of age were swiftly run, <br />
When the fond father thought the time drew on <br />
Of settling in the world his only son. <br />
Ianthe was his choice; so wondrous fair, <br />
Her form alone with Iphis cou&#8217;d compare; <br />
A neighbour&#8217;s daughter of his own degree, <br />
And not more bless&#8217;d with Fortune&#8217;s goods than he.</p>
<p>They soon espous&#8217;d; for they with ease were join&#8217;d, <br />
Who were before contracted in the mind. <br />
Their age the same, their inclinations too; <br />
And bred together, in one school they grew. <br />
Thus, fatally dispos&#8217;d to mutual fires, <br />
They felt, before they knew, the same desires. <br />
Equal their flame, unequal was their care; <br />
One lov&#8217;d with hope, one languish&#8217;d in despair. <br />
The maid accus&#8217;d the lingring day alone: <br />
For whom she thought a man, she thought her own. <br />
But Iphis bends beneath a greater grief; <br />
As fiercely burns, but hopes for no relief. <br />
Ev&#8217;n her despair adds fuel to her fire; <br />
A maid with madness does a maid desire. <br />
And, scarce refraining tears, Alas, said she, <br />
What issue of my love remains for me! <br />
How wild a passion works within my breast, <br />
With what prodigious flames am I possest! <br />
Could I the care of Providence deserve, <br />
Heav&#8217;n must destroy me, if it would preserve. <br />
And that&#8217;s my fate, or sure it would have sent <br />
Some usual evil for my punishment: <br />
Not this unkindly curse; to rage, and burn, <br />
Where Nature shews no prospect of return. <br />
Nor cows for cows consume with fruitless fire; <br />
Nor mares, when hot, their fellow-mares desire: <br />
The father of the fold supplies his ewes; <br />
The stag through secret woods his hind pursues; <br />
And birds for mates the males of their own species chuse. <br />
Her females Nature guards from female flame, <br />
And joins two sexes to preserve the game: <br />
Wou&#8217;d I were nothing, or not what I am! <br />
Crete, fam&#8217;d for monsters, wanted of her store, <br />
&#8216;Till my new love produc&#8217;d one monster more. <br />
The daughter of the sun a bull desir&#8217;d, <br />
And yet ev&#8217;n then a male a female fir&#8217;d: <br />
Her passion was extravagantly new, <br />
But mine is much the madder of the two. <br />
To things impossible she was not bent, <br />
But found the means to compass her intent. <br />
To cheat his eyes she took a different shape; <br />
Yet still she gain&#8217;d a lover, and a leap. <br />
Shou&#8217;d all the wit of all the world conspire, <br />
Shou&#8217;d Daedalus assist my wild desire, <br />
What art can make me able to enjoy, <br />
Or what can change Ianthe to a boy? <br />
Extinguish then thy passion, hopeless maid, <br />
And recollect thy reason for thy aid. <br />
Know what thou art, and love as maidens ought, <br />
And drive these golden wishes from thy thought. <br />
Thou canst not hope thy fond desires to gain; <br />
Where hope is wanting, wishes are in vain.</p>
<p>And yet no guards against our joys conspire; <br />
No jealous husband hinders our desire; <br />
My parents are propitious to my wish, <br />
And she herself consenting to the bliss. <br />
All things concur to prosper our design; <br />
All things to prosper any love but mine. <br />
And yet I never can enjoy the fair; <br />
&#8216;Tis past the pow&#8217;r of Heav&#8217;n to grant my pray&#8217;r. <br />
Heav&#8217;n has been kind, as far as Heav&#8217;n can be; <br />
Our parents with our own desires agree; <br />
But Nature, stronger than the Gods above, <br />
Refuses her assistance to my love; <br />
She sets the bar that causes all my pain; <br />
One gift refus&#8217;d, makes all their bounty vain. <br />
And now the happy day is just at hand, <br />
To bind our hearts in Hymen&#8217;s holy band: <br />
Our hearts, but not our bodies: thus accurs&#8217;d, <br />
In midst of water I complain of thirst. <br />
Why com&#8217;st thou, Juno, to these barren rites, <br />
To bless a bed defrauded of delights? <br />
But why shou&#8217;d Hymen lift his torch on high, <br />
To see two brides in cold embraces lye?</p>
<p>Thus love-sick Iphis her vain passion mourns; <br />
With equal ardour fair Ianthe burns, <br />
Invoking Hymen&#8217;s name, and Juno&#8217;s pow&#8217;r, <br />
To speed the work, and haste the happy hour.</p>
<p>She hopes, while Telethusa fears the day, <br />
And strives to interpose some new delay: <br />
Now feigns a sickness, now is in a fright <br />
For this bad omen, or that boding sight. <br />
But having done whate&#8217;er she could devise, <br />
And empty&#8217;d all her magazine of lies, <br />
The time approach&#8217;d; the next ensuing day <br />
The fatal secret must to light betray. <br />
Then Telethusa had recourse to pray&#8217;r, <br />
She, and her daughter with dishevel&#8217;d hair; <br />
Trembling with fear, great Isis they ador&#8217;d, <br />
Embrac&#8217;d her altar, and her aid implor&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Fair queen, who dost on fruitful Egypt smile, <br />
Who sway&#8217;st the sceptre of the Pharian isle, <br />
And sev&#8217;n-fold falls of disemboguing Nile, <br />
Relieve, in this our last distress, she said, <br />
A suppliant mother, and a mournful maid. <br />
Thou, Goddess, thou wert present to my sight; <br />
Reveal&#8217;d I saw thee by thy own fair light: <br />
I saw thee in my dream, as now I see, <br />
With all thy marks of awful majesty: <br />
The glorious train that compass&#8217;d thee around; <br />
And heard the hollow timbrels holy sound. <br />
Thy words I noted, which I still retain; <br />
Let not thy sacred oracles be vain. <br />
That Iphis lives, that I myself am free <br />
From shame, and punishment, I owe to thee. <br />
On thy protection all our hopes depend. <br />
Thy counsel sav&#8217;d us, let thy pow&#8217;r defend.</p>
<p>Her tears pursu&#8217;d her words; and while she spoke, <br />
The Goddess nodded, and her altar shook: <br />
The temple doors, as with a blast of wind, <br />
Were heard to clap; the lunar horns that bind <br />
The brows of Isis cast a blaze around; <br />
The trembling timbrel made a murm&#8217;ring sound.</p>
<p>Some hopes these happy omens did impart; <br />
Forth went the mother with a beating heart: <br />
Not much in fear, nor fully satisfy&#8217;d; <br />
But Iphis follow&#8217;d with a larger stride: <br />
The whiteness of her skin forsook her face; <br />
Her looks embolden&#8217;d with an awful grace; <br />
Her features, and her strength together grew, <br />
And her long hair to curling locks withdrew. <br />
Her sparkling eyes with manly vigour shone, <br />
Big was her voice, audacious was her tone. <br />
The latent parts, at length reveal&#8217;d, began <br />
To shoot, and spread, and burnish into man. <br />
The maid becomes a youth; no more delay <br />
Your vows, but look, and confidently pay. <br />
Their gifts the parents to the temple bear: <br />
The votive tables this inscription wear; <br />
Iphis the man, has to the Goddess paid <br />
The vows, that Iphis offer&#8217;d when a maid.</p>
<p>Now when the star of day had shewn his face, <br />
Venus and Juno with their presence grace <br />
The nuptial rites, and Hymen from above <br />
Descending to compleat their happy love; <br />
The Gods of marriage lend their mutual aid; <br />
And the warm youth enjoys the lovely maid. </p>
