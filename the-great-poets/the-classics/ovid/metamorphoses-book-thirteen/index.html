				<p>The Speeches of Ajax and Ulysses</p>
<p>The chiefs were set; the soldiers crown&#8217;d the field: <br />
To these the master of the seven-fold shield <br />
Upstarted fierce: and kindled with disdain. <br />
Eager to speak, unable to contain <br />
His boiling rage, he rowl&#8217;d his eyes around <br />
The shore, and Graecian gallies hall&#8217;d a-ground. <br />
Then stretching out his hands, O Jove, he cry&#8217;d, <br />
Must then our cause before the fleet be try&#8217;d? <br />
And dares Ulysses for the prize contend, <br />
In sight of what he durst not once defend? <br />
But basely fled that memorable day, <br />
When I from Hector&#8217;s hands redeem&#8217;d the flaming prey. <br />
So much &#8217;tis safer at the noisie bar <br />
With words to flourish, than ingage in war. <br />
By diff&#8217;rent methods we maintain our right, <br />
Nor am I made to talk, nor he to fight. <br />
In bloody fields I labour to be great; <br />
His arms are a smooth tongue, and soft deceit: <br />
Nor need I speak my deeds, for those you see, <br />
The sun, and day are witnesses for me. <br />
Let him who fights unseen, relate his own, <br />
And vouch the silent stars, and conscious moon. <br />
Great is the prize demanded, I confess, <br />
But such an abject rival makes it less; <br />
That gift, those honours, he but hop&#8217;d to gain, <br />
Can leave no room for Ajax to be vain: <br />
Losing he wins, because his name will be <br />
Ennobled by defeat, who durst contend with me. <br />
Were my known valour question&#8217;d, yet my blood <br />
Without that plea wou&#8217;d make my title good: <br />
My sire was Telamon, whose arms, employ&#8217;d <br />
With Hercules, these Trojan walls destroy&#8217;d; <br />
And who before with Jason sent from Greece, <br />
In the first ship brought home the golden fleece. <br />
Great Telamon from Aeacus derives <br />
His birth (th&#8217; inquisitor of guilty lives <br />
In shades below; where Sisyphus, whose son <br />
This thief is thought, rouls up the restless heavy stone), <br />
Just Aeacus, the king of Gods above <br />
Begot: thus Ajax is the third from Jove. <br />
Nor shou&#8217;d I seek advantage from my line, <br />
Unless (Achilles) it was mix&#8217;d with thine: <br />
As next of kin, Achilles&#8217; arms I claim; <br />
This fellow wou&#8217;d ingraft a foreign name <br />
Upon our stock, and the Sisyphian seed <br />
By fraud, and theft asserts his father&#8217;s breed: <br />
Then must I lose these arms, because I came <br />
To fight uncall&#8217;d, a voluntary name, <br />
Nor shunn&#8217;d the cause, but offer&#8217;d you my aid? <br />
While he long lurking was to war betray&#8217;d: <br />
Forc&#8217;d to the field he came, but in the reer; <br />
And feign&#8217;d distraction to conceal his fear: <br />
&#8216;Till one more cunning caught him in the snare <br />
(Ill for himself); and dragg&#8217;d him into war. <br />
Now let a hero&#8217;s arms a coward vest, <br />
And he who shunn&#8217;d all honours, gain the best: <br />
And let me stand excluded from my right, <br />
Robb&#8217;d of my kinsman&#8217;s arms, who first appear&#8217;d in fight, <br />
Better for us, at home had he remain&#8217;d, <br />
Had it been true the madness which he feign&#8217;d, <br />
Or so believ&#8217;d; the less had been our shame, <br />
The less his counsell&#8217;d crime, which brands the Grecian name; <br />
Nor Philoctetes had been left inclos&#8217;d <br />
In a bare isle, to wants and pains expos&#8217;d, <br />
Where to the rocks, with solitary groans, <br />
His suff&#8217;rings, and our baseness he bemoans: <br />
And wishes (so may Heav&#8217;n his wish fulfill) <br />
The due reward to him, who caus&#8217;d his ill. <br />
Now he, with us to Troy&#8217;s destruction sworn, <br />
Our brother of the war, by whom are born <br />
Alcides&#8217; arrows, pent in narrow bounds, <br />
With cold and hunger pinch&#8217;d, and pain&#8217;d with wounds, <br />
To find him food and cloathing, must employ <br />
Against the birds the shafts due to the fate of Troy. <br />
Yet still he lives, and lives from treason free, <br />
Because he left Ulysses&#8217; company; <br />
Poor Palamede might wish, so void of aid, <br />
Rather to have been left, than so to death betray&#8217;d. <br />
The coward bore the man immortal spight, <br />
Who sham&#8217;d him out of madness into fight: <br />
Nor daring otherwise to vent his hate, <br />
Accus&#8217;d him first of treason to the state; <br />
And then for proof produc&#8217;d the golden store, <br />
Himself had hidden in his tent before: <br />
Thus of two champions he depriv&#8217;d our host, <br />
By exile one, and one by treason lost. <br />
Thus fights Ulysses, thus his fame extends, <br />
A formidable man, but to his friends: <br />
Great, for what greatness is in words, and sound, <br />
Ev&#8217;n faithful Nestor less in both is found: <br />
But that he might without a rival reign, <br />
He left this faithful Nestor on the plain; <br />
Forsook his friend ev&#8217;n at his utmost need, <br />
Who tir&#8217;d, and tardy with his wounded steed, <br />
Cry&#8217;d out for aid, and call&#8217;d him by his name; <br />
But cowardice has neither ears nor shame; <br />
Thus fled the good old man, bereft of aid, <br />
And, for as much as lay in him, betray&#8217;d: <br />
That this is not a fable forg&#8217;d by me, <br />
Like one of his, an Ulyssean lie, <br />
I vouch ev&#8217;n Diomede, who tho&#8217; his friend, <br />
Cannot that act excuse, much less defend: <br />
He call&#8217;d him back aloud, and tax&#8217;d his fear; <br />
And sure enough he heard, but durst not hear.</p>
<p>The Gods with equal eyes on mortal look, <br />
He justly was forsaken, who forsook: <br />
Wanted that succour, he refus&#8217;d to lend, <br />
Found ev&#8217;ry fellow such another friend: <br />
No wonder, if he roar&#8217;d that all might hear; <br />
His elocution was increas&#8217;d by fear: <br />
I heard, I ran, I found him out of breath, <br />
Pale, trembling, and half dead with fear of death. <br />
Though he had judg&#8217;d himself by his own laws, <br />
And stood condemn&#8217;d, I help&#8217;d the common cause: <br />
With my broad buckler hid him from the foe <br />
(Ev&#8217;n the shield trembled as he lay below); <br />
And from impending Fate the coward freed: <br />
Good Heav&#8217;n forgive me for so bad a deed! <br />
If still he will persist, and urge the strife, <br />
First let him give me back his forfeit life: <br />
Let him return to that opprobrious field; <br />
Again creep under my protecting shield: <br />
Let him lie wounded, let the foe be near, <br />
And let his quiv&#8217;ring heart confess his fear; <br />
There put him in the very jaws of Fate; <br />
And let him plead his cause in that estate: <br />
And yet when snatch&#8217;d from death, when from below <br />
My lifted shield I loos&#8217;d, and let him go; <br />
Good Heav&#8217;ns, how light he rose, with what a bound <br />
He sprung from earth, forgetful of his wound; <br />
How fresh, how eager then his feet to ply; <br />
Who had not strength to stand, had speed to fly!</p>
<p>Hector came on, and brought the Gods along; <br />
Fear seiz&#8217;d alike the feeble, and the strong: <br />
Each Greek was an Ulysses; such a dread <br />
Th&#8217; approach, and ev&#8217;n the sound of Hector bred: <br />
Him, flesh&#8217;d with slaughter, and with conquest crown&#8217;d, <br />
I met, and over-turn&#8217;d him to the ground; <br />
When after, matchless as he deem&#8217;d in might, <br />
He challeng&#8217;d all our host to single fight; <br />
All eyes were fix&#8217;d on me: the lots were thrown; <br />
But for your champion I was wish&#8217;d alone: <br />
Your vows were heard; we fought, and neither yield; <br />
Yet I return&#8217;d unvanquish&#8217;d from the field. <br />
With Jove to friend, th&#8217; insulting Trojan came, <br />
And menac&#8217;d us with force, our fleet with flame. <br />
Was it the strength of this tongue-valiant lord, <br />
In that black hour, that sav&#8217;d you from the sword? <br />
Or was my breast expos&#8217;d alone, to brave <br />
A thousand swords, a thousand ships to save? <br />
The hopes of your return! And can you yield, <br />
For a sav&#8217;d fleet, less than a single shield? <br />
Think it no boast, o Grecians, if I deem <br />
These arms want Ajax, more than Ajax them: <br />
Or, I with them an equal honour share; <br />
They honour&#8217;d to be worn, and I to wear. <br />
Will he compare my courage with his sleight? <br />
As well he may compare the day with night. <br />
Night is indeed the province of his reign: <br />
Yet all his dark exploits no more contain <br />
Than a spy taken, and a sleeper slain; <br />
A priest made pris&#8217;ner, Pallas made a prey: <br />
But none of all these actions done by day: <br />
Nor ought of these was done, and Diomede away. <br />
If on such petty merits you confer <br />
So vast a prize, let each his portion share; <br />
Make a just dividend; and if not all, <br />
The greater part to Diomede will fall. <br />
But why for Ithacus such arms as those, <br />
Who naked, and by night invades his foes? <br />
The glitt&#8217;ring helm by moonlight will proclaim <br />
The latent robber, and prevent his game: <br />
Nor cou&#8217;d he hold his tott&#8217;ring head upright <br />
Beneath that morion, or sustain the weight; <br />
Nor that right arm cou&#8217;d toss the beamy lance; <br />
Much less the left that ampler shield advance; <br />
Pond&#8217;rous with precious weight, and rough with cost <br />
Of the round world in rising gold emboss&#8217;d. <br />
That orb would ill become his hand to wield, <br />
And look as for the gold he stole the shield; <br />
Which, shou&#8217;d your error on the wretch bestow, <br />
It would not frighten, but allure the foe: <br />
Why asks he, what avails him not in fight, <br />
And wou&#8217;d but cumber, and retard his flight, <br />
In which his only excellence is plac&#8217;d? <br />
You give him death, that intercept his haste. <br />
Add, that his own is yet a maiden-shield, <br />
Nor the least dint has suffer&#8217;d in the field, <br />
Guiltless of fight: mine batter&#8217;d, hew&#8217;d, and bor&#8217;d, <br />
Worn out of service, must forsake his lord, <br />
What farther need of words our right to scan? <br />
My arguments are deeds, let action speak the man. <br />
Since from a champion&#8217;s arms the strife arose, <br />
Go cast the glorious prize amid the foes; <br />
Then send us to redeem both arms, and shield, <br />
And let him wear, who wins &#8216;em in the field.</p>
<p>He said: a murmur from a multitude, <br />
Or somewhat like a stifled shout, ensu&#8217;d: <br />
&#8216;Till from his seat arose Laertes&#8217; son, <br />
Look&#8217;d down a while, and paus&#8217;d, e&#8217;er he begun; <br />
Then, to th&#8217; expecting audience, rais&#8217;d his look, <br />
And not without prepar&#8217;d attention spoke: <br />
Soft was his tone, and sober was his face; <br />
Action his words, and words his action grace.</p>
<p>If Heav&#8217;n, my lords, had heard our common pray&#8217;r, <br />
These arms had caus&#8217;d no quarrel for an heir; <br />
Still great Achilles had his own possess&#8217;d, <br />
And we with great Achilles had been bless&#8217;d; <br />
But since hard Fate, and Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s severe decree, <br />
Have ravish&#8217;d him away from you, and me <br />
(At this he sigh&#8217;d, and wip&#8217;d his eyes, and drew, <br />
Or seem&#8217;d to draw, some drops of kindly dew), <br />
Who better can succeed Achilles lost, <br />
Than he, who gave Achilles to your hoast? <br />
This only I request, that neither he <br />
May gain, by being what he seems to be, <br />
A stupid thing; nor I may lose the prize, <br />
By having sense, which Heav&#8217;n to him denies: <br />
Since great or small, the talent I enjoy&#8217;d <br />
Was ever in the common cause employ&#8217;d; <br />
Nor let my wit, and wonted eloquence, <br />
Which often has been us&#8217;d in your defense, <br />
And in my own, this only time be brought <br />
To bear against my self, and deem&#8217;d a fault. <br />
Make not a crime, where Nature made it none; <br />
For ev&#8217;ry man may freely use his own. <br />
The deeds of long-descended ancestors <br />
Are but by grace of imputation ours, <br />
Theirs in effect; but since he draws his line <br />
From Jove, and seems to plead a right divine; <br />
From Jove, like him, I claim my pedigree, <br />
And am descended in the same degree: <br />
My sire Laertes was Arcesius&#8217; heir, <br />
Arcesius was the son of Jupiter: <br />
No parricide, no banish&#8217;d man, is known <br />
In all my line: let him excuse his own. <br />
Hermes ennobles too my mother&#8217;s side, <br />
By both my parents to the Gods ally&#8217;d. <br />
But not because that on the female part <br />
My blood is better, dare I claim desert, <br />
Or that my sire from parricide is free; <br />
But judge by merit betwixt him, and me: <br />
The prize be to the best; provided yet <br />
That Ajax for a while his kin forget, <br />
And his great sire, and greater uncle&#8217;s name, <br />
To fortifie by them his feeble claim: <br />
Be kindred and relation laid aside, <br />
And honour&#8217;s cause by laws of honour try&#8217;d: <br />
For if he plead proximity of blood; <br />
That empty title is with ease withstood. <br />
Peleus, the hero&#8217;s sire, more nigh than he, <br />
And Pyrrhus, his undoubted progeny, <br />
Inherit first these trophies of the field; <br />
To Scyros, or to Pthia, send the shield: <br />
And Teucer has an uncle&#8217;s right; yet he <br />
Waves his pretensions, nor contends with me.</p>
<p>Then since the cause on pure desert is plac&#8217;d, <br />
Whence shall I take my rise, what reckon last? <br />
I not presume on ev&#8217;ry act to dwell, <br />
But take these few, in order as they fell.</p>
<p>Thetis, who knew the Fates, apply&#8217;d her care <br />
To keep Achilles in disguise from war; <br />
And &#8217;till the threatning influence was past, <br />
A woman&#8217;s habit on the hero cast: <br />
All eyes were cozen&#8217;d by the borrow&#8217;d vest, <br />
And Ajax (never wiser than the rest) <br />
Found no Pelides there: at length I came <br />
With proffer&#8217;d wares to this pretended dame; <br />
She, not discover&#8217;d by her mien, or voice, <br />
Betray&#8217;d her manhood by her manly choice; <br />
And while on female toys her fellows look, <br />
Grasp&#8217;d in her warlike hand, a javelin shook; <br />
Whom, by this act reveal&#8217;d, I thus bespoke: <br />
O Goddess-born! resist not Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s decree, <br />
The fall of Ilium is reserv&#8217;d for thee; <br />
Then seiz&#8217;d him, and produc&#8217;d in open light, <br />
Sent blushing to the field the fatal knight. <br />
Mine then are all his actions of the war; <br />
Great Telephus was conquer&#8217;d by my spear, <br />
And after cur&#8217;d: to me the Thebans owe, <br />
Lesbos, and Tenedos, their overthrow; <br />
Syros and Cylla: not on all to dwell, <br />
By me Lyrnesus, and strong Chrysa fell: <br />
And since I sent the man who Hector slew, <br />
To me the noble Hector&#8217;s death is due: <br />
Those arms I put into his living hand, <br />
Those arms, Pelides dead, I now demand.</p>
<p>When Greece was injur&#8217;d in the Spartan prince, <br />
And met at Aulis to avenge th&#8217; offence, <br />
&#8216;Twas a dead calm, or adverse blasts, that reign&#8217;d, <br />
And in the port the wind-bound fleet detain&#8217;d: <br />
Bad signs were seen, and oracles severe <br />
Were daily thunder&#8217;d in our gen&#8217;ral&#8217;s ear; <br />
That by his daughter&#8217;s blood we must appease <br />
Diana&#8217;s kindled wrath, and free the seas. <br />
Affection, int&#8217;rest, fame, his heart assail&#8217;d: <br />
But soon the father o&#8217;er the king prevail&#8217;d: <br />
Bold, on himself he took the pious crime, <br />
As angry with the Gods, as they with him. <br />
No subject cou&#8217;d sustain their sov&#8217;reign&#8217;s look, <br />
&#8216;Till this hard enterprize I undertook: <br />
I only durst th&#8217; imperial pow&#8217;r controul, <br />
And undermin&#8217;d the parent in his soul; <br />
Forc&#8217;d him t&#8217; exert the king for common good, <br />
And pay our ransom with his daughter&#8217;s blood. <br />
Never was cause more difficult to plead, <br />
Than where the judge against himself decreed: <br />
Yet this I won by dint of argument; <br />
The wrongs his injur&#8217;d brother underwent, <br />
And his own office, sham&#8217;d him to consent.</p>
<p>&#8216;Tis harder yet to move the mother&#8217;s mind, <br />
And to this heavy task was I design&#8217;d: <br />
Reasons against her love I knew were vain; <br />
I circumvented whom I could not gain: <br />
Had Ajax been employ&#8217;d, our slacken&#8217;d sails <br />
Had still at Aulis waited happy gales.</p>
<p>Arriv&#8217;d at Troy, your choice was fix&#8217;d on me, <br />
A fearless envoy, fit for a bold embassy: <br />
Secure, I enter&#8217;d through the hostile court, <br />
Glitt&#8217;ring with steel, and crowded with resort: <br />
There, in the midst of arms, I plead our cause, <br />
Urge the foul rape, and violated laws; <br />
Accuse the foes, as authors of the strife, <br />
Reproach the ravisher, demand the wife. <br />
Priam, Antenor, and the wiser few, <br />
I mov&#8217;d; but Paris, and his lawless crew <br />
Scarce held their hands, and lifted swords; but stood <br />
In act to quench their impious thirst of blood: <br />
This Menelaus knows; expos&#8217;d to share <br />
With me the rough preludium of the war.</p>
<p>Endless it were to tell, what I have done, <br />
In arms, or council, since the siege begun: <br />
The first encounter&#8217;s past, the foe repell&#8217;d, <br />
They skulk&#8217;d within the town, we kept the field. <br />
War seem&#8217;d asleep for nine long years; at length <br />
Both sides resolv&#8217;d to push, we try&#8217;d our strength <br />
Now what did Ajax, while our arms took breath, <br />
Vers&#8217;d only in the gross mechanick trade of death? <br />
If you require my deeds, with ambush&#8217;d arms <br />
I trapp&#8217;d the foe, or tir&#8217;d with false alarms; <br />
Secur&#8217;d the ships, drew lines along the plain, <br />
The fainting chear&#8217;d, chastis&#8217;d the rebel-train, <br />
Provided forage, our spent arms renew&#8217;d; <br />
Employ&#8217;d at home, or sent abroad, the common cause pursu&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The king, deluded in a dream by Jove, <br />
Despair&#8217;d to take the town, and order&#8217;d to remove. <br />
What subject durst arraign the Pow&#8217;r supream, <br />
Producing Jove to justifie his dream? <br />
Ajax might wish the soldiers to retain <br />
From shameful flight, but wishes were in vain: <br />
As wanting of effect had been his words, <br />
Such as of course his thundring tongue affords. <br />
But did this boaster threaten, did he pray, <br />
Or by his own example urge their stay? <br />
None, none of these: but ran himself away. <br />
I saw him run, and was asham&#8217;d to see; <br />
Who ply&#8217;d his feet so fast to get aboard, as he? <br />
Then speeding through the place, I made a stand, <br />
And loudly cry&#8217;d, O base degenerate band, <br />
To leave a town already in your hand! <br />
After so long expence of blood, for fame, <br />
To bring home nothing, but perpetual shame! <br />
These words, or what I have forgotten since <br />
(For grief inspir&#8217;d me then with eloquence), <br />
Reduc&#8217;d their minds; they leave the crowded port, <br />
And to their late forsaken camp resort: <br />
Dismay&#8217;d the council met: this man was there, <br />
But mute, and not recover&#8217;d of his fear: <br />
Thersites tax&#8217;d the king, and loudly rail&#8217;d, <br />
But his wide opening mouth with blows I seal&#8217;d. <br />
Then, rising, I excite their souls to fame, <br />
And kindle sleeping virtue into flame. <br />
From thence, whatever he perform&#8217;d in fight <br />
Is justly mine, who drew him back from flight.</p>
<p>Which of the Grecian chiefs consorts with thee? <br />
But Diomede desires my company, <br />
And still communicates his praise with me. <br />
As guided by a God, secure he goes, <br />
Arm&#8217;d with my fellowship, amid the foes: <br />
And sure no little merit I may boast, <br />
Whom such a man selects from such an hoast; <br />
Unforc&#8217;d by lots I went without affright, <br />
To dare with him the dangers of the night: <br />
On the same errand sent, we met the spy <br />
Of Hector, double-tongu&#8217;d, and us&#8217;d to lie; <br />
Him I dispatch&#8217;d, but not &#8217;till undermin&#8217;d, <br />
I drew him first to tell, what treach&#8217;rous Troy design&#8217;d: <br />
My task perform&#8217;d, with praise I had retir&#8217;d, <br />
But not content with this, to greater praise aspir&#8217;d: <br />
Invaded Rhesus, and his Thracian crew, <br />
And him, and his, in their own strength I slew; <br />
Return&#8217;d a victor, all my vows compleat, <br />
With the king&#8217;s chariot, in his royal seat: <br />
Refuse me now his arms, whose fiery steeds <br />
Were promis&#8217;d to the spy for his nocturnal deeds: <br />
Yet let dull Ajax bear away my right, <br />
When all his days out-balance this one night.</p>
<p>Nor fought I darkling still: the sun beheld <br />
With slaughter&#8217;d Lycians when I strew&#8217;d the field: <br />
You saw, and counted as I pass&#8217;d along, <br />
Alastor, Chromius, Ceranos the strong, <br />
Alcander, Prytanis, and Halius, <br />
Noemon, Charopes, and Ennomus; <br />
Coon, Chersidamas; and five beside, <br />
Men of obscure descent, but courage try&#8217;d: <br />
All these this hand laid breathless on the ground; <br />
Nor want I proofs of many a manly wound: <br />
All honest, all before: believe not me; <br />
Words may deceive, but credit what you see.</p>
<p>At this he bar&#8217;d his breast, and show&#8217;d his scars, <br />
As of a furrow&#8217;d field, well plow&#8217;d with wars; <br />
Nor is this part unexercis&#8217;d, said he; <br />
That gyant-bulk of his from wounds is free: <br />
Safe in his shield he fears no foe to try, <br />
And better manages his blood, than I: <br />
But this avails me not; our boaster strove <br />
Not with our foes alone, but partial Jove, <br />
To save the fleet: this I confess is true <br />
(Nor will I take from any man his due): <br />
But thus assuming all, he robs from you. <br />
Some part of honour to your share will fall, <br />
He did the best indeed, but did not all. <br />
Patroclus in Achilles&#8217; arms, and thought <br />
The chief he seem&#8217;d, with equal ardour fought; <br />
Preserv&#8217;d the fleet, repell&#8217;d the raging fire, <br />
And forc&#8217;d the fearful Trojans to retire.</p>
<p>But Ajax boasts, that he was only thought <br />
A match for Hector, who the combat sought: <br />
Sure he forgets the king, the chiefs, and me: <br />
All were as eager for the fight, as he: <br />
He but the ninth, and not by publick voice, <br />
Or ours preferr&#8217;d, was only Fortune&#8217;s choice: <br />
They fought; nor can our hero boast th&#8217; event, <br />
For Hector from the field unwounded went.</p>
<p>Why am I forc&#8217;d to name that fatal day, <br />
That snatch&#8217;d the prop and pride of Greece away? <br />
I saw Pelides sink, with pious grief, <br />
And ran in vain, alas! to his relief; <br />
For the brave soul was fled: full of my friend <br />
I rush&#8217;d amid the war, his relicks to defend: <br />
Nor ceas&#8217;d my toil, &#8217;till I redeem&#8217;d the prey, <br />
And, loaded with Achilles, march&#8217;d away: <br />
Those arms, which on these shoulders then I bore, <br />
&#8216;Tis just you to these shoulders should restore. <br />
You see I want not nerves, who cou&#8217;d sustain <br />
The pond&#8217;rous ruins of so great a man: <br />
Or if in others equal force you find, <br />
None is endu&#8217;d with a more grateful mind.</p>
<p>Did Thetis then, ambitious in her care, <br />
These arms thus labour&#8217;d for her son prepare; <br />
That Ajax after him the heav&#8217;nly gift shou&#8217;d wear! <br />
For that dull soul to stare with stupid eyes, <br />
On the learn&#8217;d unintelligible prize! <br />
What are to him the sculptures of the shield, <br />
Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s planets, Earth, and Ocean&#8217;s watry field? <br />
The Pleiads, Hyads; less, and greater Bear, <br />
Undipp&#8217;d in seas; Orion&#8217;s angry star; <br />
Two diff&#8217;ring cities, grav&#8217;d on either hand; <br />
Would he wear arms he cannot understand?</p>
<p>Beside, what wise objections he prepares <br />
Against my late accession to the wars? <br />
Does not the fool perceive his argument <br />
Is with more force against Achilles bent? <br />
For if dissembling be so great a crime, <br />
The fault is common, and the same in him: <br />
And if he taxes both of long delay, <br />
My guilt is less, who sooner came away. <br />
His pious mother, anxious for his life, <br />
Detain&#8217;d her son; and me, my pious wife. <br />
To them the blossoms of our youth were due, <br />
Our riper manhood we reserv&#8217;d for you. <br />
But grant me guilty, &#8217;tis not much my care, <br />
When with so great a man my guilt I share: <br />
My wit to war the matchless hero brought, <br />
But by this fool I never had been caught.</p>
<p>Nor need I wonder, that on me he threw <br />
Such foul aspersions, when he spares not you: <br />
If Palamede unjustly fell by me, <br />
Your honour suffer&#8217;d in th&#8217; unjust decree: <br />
I but accus&#8217;d, you doom&#8217;d: and yet he dy&#8217;d, <br />
Convinc&#8217;d of treason, and was fairly try&#8217;d: <br />
You heard not he was false; your eyes beheld <br />
The traytor manifest; the bribe reveal&#8217;d.</p>
<p>That Philoctetes is on Lemnos left, <br />
Wounded, forlorn, of human aid bereft, <br />
Is not my crime, or not my crime alone; <br />
Defend your justice, for the fact&#8217;s your own: <br />
&#8216;Tis true, th&#8217; advice was mine; that staying there <br />
He might his weary limbs with rest repair, <br />
From a long voyage free, and from a longer war. <br />
He took the counsl, and he lives at least; <br />
Th&#8217; event declares I counsell&#8217;d for the best: <br />
Though faith is all in ministers of state; <br />
For who can promise to be fortunate? <br />
Now since his arrows are the Fate of Troy, <br />
Do not my wit, or weak address, employ; <br />
Send Ajax there, with his persuasive sense, <br />
To mollifie the man, and draw him thence: <br />
But Xanthus shall run backward; Ida stand <br />
A leafless mountain; and the Grecian band <br />
Shall fight for Troy; if, when my councils fail, <br />
The wit of heavy Ajax can prevail.</p>
<p>Hard Philoctetes, exercise thy spleen <br />
Against thy fellows, and the king of men; <br />
Curse my devoted head, above the rest, <br />
And wish in arms to meet me breast to breast: <br />
Yet I the dang&#8217;rous task will undertake, <br />
And either die my self, or bring thee back.</p>
<p>Nor doubt the same success, as when before <br />
The Phrygian prophet to these tents I bore, <br />
Surpriz&#8217;d by night, and forc&#8217;d him to declare <br />
In what was plac&#8217;d the fortune of the war, <br />
Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s dark decrees, and answers to display, <br />
And how to take the town, and where the secret lay: <br />
Yet this I compass&#8217;d, and from Troy convey&#8217;d <br />
The fatal image of their guardian-maid; <br />
That work was mine; for Pallas, though our friend, <br />
Yet while she was in Troy, did Troy defend. <br />
Now what has Ajax done, or what design&#8217;d? <br />
A noisie nothing, and an empty wind. <br />
If he be what he promises in show, <br />
Why was I sent, and why fear&#8217;d he to go? <br />
Our boasting champion thought the task not light <br />
To pass the guards, commit himself to night; <br />
Not only through a hostile town to pass, <br />
But scale, with steep ascent, the sacred place; <br />
With wand&#8217;ring steps to search the cittadel, <br />
And from the priests their patroness to steal: <br />
Then through surrounding foes to force my way, <br />
And bear in triumph home the heavn&#8217;ly prey; <br />
Which had I not, Ajax in vain had held, <br />
Before that monst&#8217;rous bulk, his sev&#8217;nfold shield. <br />
That night to conquer Troy I might be said, <br />
When Troy was liable to conquest made.</p>
<p>Why point&#8217;st thou to my partner of the war? <br />
Tydides had indeed a worthy share <br />
In all my toil, and praise; but when thy might <br />
Our ships protected, did&#8217;st thou singly fight? <br />
All join&#8217;d, and thou of many wert but one; <br />
I ask&#8217;d no friend, nor had, but him alone: <br />
Who, had he not been well assur&#8217;d, that art, <br />
And conduct were of war the better part, <br />
And more avail&#8217;d than strength, my valiant friend <br />
Had urg&#8217;d a better right, than Ajax can pretend: <br />
As good at least Eurypilus may claim, <br />
And the more mod&#8217;rate Ajax of the name: <br />
The Cretan king, and his brave charioteer, <br />
And Menelaus bold with sword, and spear: <br />
All these had been my rivals in the shield, <br />
And yet all these to my pretensions yield. <br />
Thy boist&#8217;rous hands are then of use, when I <br />
With this directing head those hands apply. <br />
Brawn without brain is thine: my prudent care <br />
Foresees, provides, administers the war: <br />
Thy province is to fight; but when shall be <br />
The time to fight, the king consults with me: <br />
No dram of judgment with thy force is join&#8217;d: <br />
Thy body is of profit, and my mind. <br />
By how much more the ship her safety owes <br />
To him who steers, than him that only rows; <br />
By how much more the captain merits praise, <br />
Than he who fights, and fighting but obeys; <br />
By so much greater is my worth than thine, <br />
Who canst but execute, what I design. <br />
What gain&#8217;st thou, brutal man, if I confess <br />
Thy strength superior, when thy wit is less? <br />
Mind is the man: I claim my whole desert, <br />
From the mind&#8217;s vigour, and th&#8217; immortal part.</p>
<p>But you, o Grecian chiefs, reward my care, <br />
Be grateful to your watchman of the war: <br />
For all my labours in so long a space, <br />
Sure I may plead a title to your grace: <br />
Enter the town, I then unbarr&#8217;d the gates, <br />
When I remov&#8217;d their tutelary Fates. <br />
By all our common hopes, if hopes they be <br />
Which I have now reduc&#8217;d to certainty; <br />
By falling Troy, by yonder tott&#8217;ring tow&#8217;rs, <br />
And by their taken Gods, which now are ours; <br />
Or if there yet a farther task remains, <br />
To be perform&#8217;d by prudence, or by pains; <br />
If yet some desp&#8217;rate action rests behind, <br />
That asks high conduct, and a dauntless mind; <br />
If ought be wanting to the Trojan doom, <br />
Which none but I can manage, and o&#8217;ercome, <br />
Award, those arms I ask, by your decree: <br />
Or give to this, what you refuse to me.</p>
<p>He ceas&#8217;d: and ceasing with respect he bow&#8217;d, <br />
And with his hand at once the fatal statue show&#8217;d. <br />
Heav&#8217;n, air and ocean rung, with loud applause, <br />
And by the gen&#8217;ral vote he gain&#8217;d his cause. <br />
Thus conduct won the prize, when courage fail&#8217;d, <br />
And eloquence o&#8217;er brutal force prevail&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The Death of Ajax</p>
<p>He who cou&#8217;d often, and alone, withstand <br />
The foe, the fire, and Jove&#8217;s own partial hand, <br />
Now cannot his unmaster&#8217;d grief sustain, <br />
But yields to rage, to madness, and disdain; <br />
Then snatching out his fauchion, Thou, said he, <br />
Art mine; Ulysses lays no claim to thee. <br />
O often try&#8217;d, and ever-trusty sword, <br />
Now do thy last kind office to thy lord: <br />
&#8216;Tis Ajax who requests thy aid, to show <br />
None but himself, himself cou&#8217;d overthrow: <br />
He said, and with so good a will to die, <br />
Did to his breast the fatal point apply, <br />
It found his heart, a way &#8217;till then unknown, <br />
Where never weapon enter&#8217;d, but his own. <br />
No hands cou&#8217;d force it thence, so fix&#8217;d it stood, <br />
&#8216;Till out it rush&#8217;d, expell&#8217;d by streams of spouting blood. <br />
The fruitful blood produc&#8217;d a flow&#8217;r, which grew <br />
On a green stem; and of a purple hue: <br />
Like his, whom unaware Apollo slew: <br />
Inscrib&#8217;d in both, the letters are the same, <br />
But those express the grief, and these the name.</p>
<p>The Story of Polyxena and Hecuba</p>
<p>The victor with full sails for Lemnos stood <br />
(Once stain&#8217;d by matrons with their husbands&#8217; blood), <br />
Thence great Alcides&#8217; fatal shafts to bear, <br />
Assign&#8217;d to Philoctetes&#8217; secret care. <br />
These with their guardian to the Greeks convey&#8217;d, <br />
Their ten years&#8217; toil with wish&#8217;d success repaid. <br />
With Troy old Priam falls: his queen survives; <br />
&#8216;Till all her woes compleat, transform&#8217;d she grieves <br />
In borrow&#8217;d sounds, nor with an human face, <br />
Barking tremendous o&#8217;er the plains of Thrace. <br />
Still Ilium&#8217;s flames their pointed columns raise, <br />
And the red Hellespont reflects the blaze. <br />
Shed on Jove&#8217;s altar are the poor remains <br />
Of blood, which trickl&#8217;d from old Priam&#8217;s veins. <br />
Cassandra lifts her hands to Heav&#8217;n in vain, <br />
Drag&#8217;d by her sacred hair; the trembling train <br />
Of matrons to their burning temples fly: <br />
There to their Gods for kind protection cry; <br />
And to their statues cling &#8217;till forc&#8217;d away, <br />
The victor Greeks bear off th&#8217; invidious prey. <br />
From those high tow&#8217;rs Astyanax is thrown, <br />
Whence he was wont with pleasure to look down. <br />
When oft his mother with a fond delight <br />
Pointed to view his father&#8217;s rage in fight, <br />
To win renown, and guard his country&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>The winds now call to sea; brisk northern gales <br />
Sing in the shrowds, and court the spreading sails. <br />
Farewel, dear Troy, the captive matrons cry; <br />
Yes, we must leave our long-lov&#8217;d native sky. <br />
Then prostrate on the shore they kiss the sand, <br />
And quit the smoking ruines of the land. <br />
Last Hecuba on board, sad sight! appears; <br />
Found weeping o&#8217;er her children&#8217;s sepulchres: <br />
Drag&#8217;d by Ulysses from her slaughter&#8217;d sons, <br />
Whilst yet she graspt their tombs, and kist their mouldring bones. <br />
Yet Hector&#8217;s ashes from his urn she bore, <br />
And in her bosom the sad relique wore: <br />
Then scatter&#8217;d on his tomb her hoary hairs, <br />
A poor oblation mingled with her tears.</p>
<p>Oppos&#8217;d to Ilium lye the Thracian plains, <br />
Where Polymestor safe in plenty reigns. <br />
King Priam to his care commits his son, <br />
Young Polydore, the chance of war to shun. <br />
A wise precaution! had not gold, consign&#8217;d <br />
For the child&#8217;s use, debauch&#8217;d the tyrant&#8217;s mind. <br />
When sinking Troy to its last period drew, <br />
With impious hands his royal charge he slew; <br />
Then in the sea the lifeless coarse is thrown; <br />
As with the body he the guilt could drown.</p>
<p>The Greeks now riding on the Thracian shore, <br />
&#8216;Till kinder gales invite, their vessels moor. <br />
Here the wide-op&#8217;ning Earth to sudden view <br />
Disclos&#8217;d Achilles, great as when he drew <br />
The vital air, but fierce with proud disdain, <br />
As when he sought Briseis to regain; <br />
When stern debate, and rash injurious strife <br />
Unsheath&#8217;d his sword, to reach Atrides&#8217; life. <br />
And will ye go? he said. Is then the name <br />
Of the once great Achilles lost to fame? <br />
Yet stay, ungrateful Greeks; nor let me sue <br />
In vain for honours to my Manes due. <br />
For this just end, Polyxena I doom <br />
With victim-rites to grace my slighted tomb.</p>
<p>The phantom spoke; the ready Greeks obey&#8217;d, <br />
And to the tomb led the devoted maid <br />
Snatch&#8217;d from her mother, who with pious care <br />
Cherish&#8217;d this last relief of her despair. <br />
Superior to her sex, the fearless maid, <br />
Approach&#8217;d the altar, and around survey&#8217;d <br />
The cruel rites, and consecrated knife, <br />
Which Pyrrhus pointed at her guiltless life, <br />
Then as with stern amaze intent he stood, <br />
&#8220;Now strike,&#8221; she said; &#8220;now spill my genr&#8217;ous blood; <br />
Deep in my breast, or throat, your dagger sheath, <br />
Whilst thus I stand prepar&#8217;d to meet my death. <br />
For life on terms of slav&#8217;ry I despise: <br />
Yet sure no God approves this sacrifice. <br />
O cou&#8217;d I but conceal this dire event <br />
From my sad mother, I should dye content. <br />
Yet should she not with tears my death deplore, <br />
Since her own wretched life demands them more. <br />
But let not the rude touch of man pollute <br />
A virgin-victim; &#8217;tis a modest suit. <br />
It best will please, whoe&#8217;er demands my blood, <br />
That I untainted reach the Stygian flood. <br />
Yet let one short, last, dying prayer be heard; <br />
To Priam&#8217;s daughter pay this last regard; <br />
&#8216;Tis Priam&#8217;s daughter, not a captive, sues; <br />
Do not the rites of sepulture refuse. <br />
To my afflicted mother, I implore, <br />
Free without ransom my dead corpse restore: <br />
Nor barter me for gain, when I am cold; <br />
But be her tears the price, if I am sold: <br />
Time was she could have ransom&#8217;d me with gold&#8221;.</p>
<p>Thus as she pray&#8217;d, one common shower of tears <br />
Burst forth, and stream&#8217;d from ev&#8217;ry eye but hers. <br />
Ev&#8217;n the priest wept, and with a rude remorse <br />
Plung&#8217;d in her heart the steel&#8217;s resistless force. <br />
Her slacken&#8217;d limbs sunk gently to the ground, <br />
Dauntless her looks, unalter&#8217;d by the wound. <br />
And as she fell, she strove with decent pride <br />
To hide, what suits a virgin&#8217;s care to hide. <br />
The Trojan matrons the pale corpse receive, <br />
And the whole slaughter&#8217;d race of Priam grieve, <br />
Sad they recount the long disastrous tale; <br />
Then with fresh tears, thee, royal maid, bewail; <br />
Thy widow&#8217;d mother too, who flourish&#8217;d late <br />
The royal pride of Asia&#8217;s happier state: <br />
A captive lot now to Ulysses born; <br />
Whom yet the victor would reject with scorn, <br />
Were she not Hector&#8217;s mother: Hector&#8217;s fame <br />
Scarce can a master for his mother claim! <br />
With strict embrace the lifeless coarse she view&#8217;d; <br />
And her fresh grief that flood of tears renew&#8217;d, <br />
With which she lately mourn&#8217;d so many dead; <br />
Tears for her country, sons, and husband shed. <br />
With the thick gushing stream she bath&#8217;d the wound; <br />
Kiss&#8217;d her pale lips; then weltring on the ground, <br />
With wonted rage her frantick bosom tore; <br />
Sweeping her hair amidst the clotted gore; <br />
Whilst her sad accents thus her loss deplore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Behold a mother&#8217;s last dear pledge of woe! <br />
Yes, &#8217;tis the last I have to suffer now. <br />
Thou, my Polyxena, my ills must crown: <br />
Already in thy Fate, I feel my own. <br />
&#8216;Tis thus, lest haply of my numerous seed <br />
One should unslaughter&#8217;d fall, even thou must bleed: <br />
And yet I hop&#8217;d thy sex had been thy guard; <br />
But neither has thy tender sex been spar&#8217;d. <br />
The same Achilles, by whose deadly hate <br />
Thy brothers fell, urg&#8217;d thy untimely fate! <br />
The same Achilles, whose destructive rage <br />
Laid waste my realms, has robb&#8217;d my childless age. <br />
When Paris&#8217; shafts with Phoebus&#8217; certain aid <br />
At length had pierc&#8217;d this dreaded chief, I said, <br />
Secure of future ills, he can no more: <br />
But see, he still pursues me as before. <br />
With rage rekindled his dead ashes burn; <br />
And his yet murd&#8217;ring ghost my wretched house must mourn. <br />
This tyrant&#8217;s lust of slaughter I have fed <br />
With large supplies from my too-fruitful bed. <br />
Troy&#8217;s tow&#8217;rs lye waste; and the wide ruin ends <br />
The publick woe; but me fresh woe attends. <br />
Troy still survives to me; to none but me; <br />
And from its ills I never must be free. <br />
I, who so late had power, and wealth, and ease, <br />
Bless&#8217;d with my husband, and a large encrease, <br />
Must now in poverty an exile mourn; <br />
Ev&#8217;n from the tombs of my dead offspring torn: <br />
Giv&#8217;n to Penelope, who proud of spoil, <br />
Allots me to the loom&#8217;s ungrateful toil; <br />
Points to her dames, and crys with scorning mien: <br />
See Hector&#8217;s mother, and great Priam&#8217;s queen! <br />
And thou, my child, sole hope of all that&#8217;s lost, <br />
Thou now art slain, to sooth this hostile ghost. <br />
Yes, my child falls an offering to my foe! <br />
Then what am I, who still survive this woe? <br />
Say, cruel Gods! for what new scenes of death <br />
Must a poor aged wretch prolong this hated breath? <br />
Troy fal&#8217;n, to whom could Priam happy seem? <br />
Yet was he so; and happy must I deem <br />
His death; for O! my child, he saw not thine, <br />
When he his life did with his Troy resign. <br />
Yet sure due obsequies thy tomb might grace; <br />
And thou shalt sleep amidst thy kingly race. <br />
Alas! my child, such fortune does not wait <br />
Our suffering house in this abandon&#8217;d state. <br />
A foreign grave, and thy poor mother&#8217;s tears <br />
Are all the honours that attend thy herse. <br />
All now is lost!- Yet no; one comfort more <br />
Of life remains, my much-lov&#8217;d Polydore. <br />
My youngest hope: here on this coast he lives, <br />
Nurs&#8217;d by the guardian-king, he still survives. <br />
Then let me hasten to the cleansing flood, <br />
And wash away these stains of guiltless blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Streit to the shore her feeble steps repair <br />
With limping pace, and torn dishevell&#8217;d hair <br />
Silver&#8217;d with age. &#8220;Give me an urn,&#8221; she cry&#8217;d, <br />
&#8220;To bear back water from this swelling tide&#8221;: <br />
When on the banks her son in ghastly hue <br />
Transfix&#8217;d with Thracian arrows strikes her view. <br />
The matrons shriek&#8217;d; her big-swoln grief surpast <br />
The pow&#8217;r of utterance; she stood aghast; <br />
She had nor speech, nor tears to give relief; <br />
Excess of woe suppress&#8217;d the rising grief. <br />
Lifeless as stone, on Earth she fix&#8217;d her eyes; <br />
And then look&#8217;d up to Heav&#8217;n with wild surprise. <br />
Now she contemplates o&#8217;er with sad delight <br />
Her son&#8217;s pale visage; then her aking sight <br />
Dwells on his wounds: she varys thus by turns, <br />
Wild as the mother-lion, when among <br />
The haunts of prey she seeks her ravish&#8217;d young: <br />
Swift flies the ravisher; she marks his trace, <br />
And by the print directs her anxious chase. <br />
So Hecuba with mingled grief, and rage <br />
Pursues the king, regardless of her age. <br />
She greets the murd&#8217;rer with dissembled joy <br />
Of secret treasure hoarded for her boy. <br />
The specious tale th&#8217; unwary king betray&#8217;d. <br />
Fir&#8217;d with the hopes of prey: &#8220;Give quick,&#8221; he said <br />
With soft enticing speech, &#8220;the promis&#8217;d store: <br />
Whate&#8217;er you give, you give to Polydore. <br />
Your son, by the immortal Gods I swear, <br />
Shall this with all your former bounty share.&#8221; <br />
She stands attentive to his soothing lyes, <br />
And darts avenging horrour from her eyes. <br />
Then full resentment fires her boyling blood: <br />
She springs upon him, &#8216;midst the captive crowd <br />
(Her thirst of vengeance want of strength supplies): <br />
Fastens her forky fingers in his eyes: <br />
Tears out the rooted balls; her rage pursues, <br />
And in the hollow orbs her hand imbrews.</p>
<p>The Thracians, fir&#8217;d, at this inhuman scene, <br />
With darts, and stones assail the frantick queen. <br />
She snarls, and growls, nor in an human tone; <br />
Then bites impatient at the bounding stone; <br />
Extends her jaws, as she her voice would raise <br />
To keen invectives in her wonted phrase; <br />
But barks, and thence the yelping brute betrays. <br />
Still a sad monument the place remains, <br />
And from this monstrous change its name obtains: <br />
Where she, in long remembrance of her ills, <br />
With plaintive howlings the wide desart fills.</p>
<p>Greeks, Trojans, friends, and foes, and Gods above <br />
Her num&#8217;rous wrongs to just compassion move. <br />
Ev&#8217;n Juno&#8217;s self forgets her ancient hate, <br />
And owns, she had deserv&#8217;d a milder fate.</p>
<p>The Funeral of Memnon</p>
<p>Yet bright Aurora, partial as she was <br />
To Troy, and those that lov&#8217;d the Trojan cause, <br />
Nor Troy, nor Hecuba can now bemoan, <br />
But weeps a sad misfortune, more her own. <br />
Her offspring Memnon, by Achilles slain, <br />
She saw extended on the Phrygian plain: <br />
She saw, and strait the purple beams, that grace <br />
The rosie morning, vanish&#8217;d from her face; <br />
A deadly pale her wonted bloom invades, <br />
And veils the lowring skies with mournful shades. <br />
But when his limbs upon the pile were laid, <br />
The last kind duty that by friends is paid, <br />
His mother to the skies directs her flight, <br />
Nor cou&#8217;d sustain to view the doleful sight: <br />
But frantick, with her loose neglected hair, <br />
Hastens to Jove, and falls a suppliant there. <br />
O king of Heav&#8217;n, o father of the skies, <br />
The weeping Goddess passionately cries, <br />
Tho&#8217; I the meanest of immortals am, <br />
And fewest temples celebrate my fame, <br />
Yet still a Goddess, I presume to come <br />
Within the verge of your etherial dome: <br />
Yet still may plead some merit, if my light <br />
With purple dawn controuls the Pow&#8217;rs of night; <br />
If from a female hand that virtue springs, <br />
Which to the Gods, and men such pleasure brings. <br />
Yet I nor honours seek, nor rites divine, <br />
Nor for more altars, or more fanes repine; <br />
Oh! that such trifles were the only cause, <br />
From whence Aurora&#8217;s mind its anguish draws! <br />
For Memnon lost, my dearest only child, <br />
With weightier grief my heavy heart is fill&#8217;d; <br />
My warrior son! that liv&#8217;d but half his time, <br />
Nipt in the bud, and blasted in his prime; <br />
Who for his uncle early took the field, <br />
And by Achilles&#8217; fatal spear was kill&#8217;d. <br />
To whom but Jove shou&#8217;d I for succour come? <br />
For Jove alone cou&#8217;d fix his cruel doom. <br />
O sov&#8217;reign of the Gods accept my pray&#8217;r, <br />
Grant my request, and sooth a mother&#8217;s care; <br />
On the deceas&#8217;d some solemn boon bestow, <br />
To expiate the loss, and ease my woe.</p>
<p>Jove, with a nod, comply&#8217;d with her desire; <br />
Around the body flam&#8217;d the fun&#8217;ral fire; <br />
The pile decreas&#8217;d, that lately seem&#8217;d so high, <br />
And sheets of smoak roll&#8217;d upward to the sky: <br />
As humid vapours from a marshy bog, <br />
Rise by degrees, condensing into fog, <br />
That intercept the sun&#8217;s enliv&#8217;ning ray, <br />
And with a cloud infect the chearful day. <br />
The sooty ashes wafted by the air, <br />
Whirl round, and thicken in a body there; <br />
Then take a form, which their own heat, and fire <br />
With active life, and energy inspire. <br />
Its lightness makes it seem to fly, and soon <br />
It skims on real wings, that are its own; <br />
A real bird, it beats the breezy wind, <br />
Mix&#8217;d with a thousand sisters of the kind, <br />
That, from the same formation newly sprung, <br />
Up-born aloft on plumy pinions hung. <br />
Thrice round the pile advanc&#8217;d the circling throng. <br />
Thrice, with their wings, a whizzing consort rung. <br />
In the fourth flight their squadron they divide, <br />
Rank&#8217;d in two diff&#8217;rent troops, on either side: <br />
Then two, and two, inspir&#8217;d with martial rage, <br />
From either troop in equal pairs engage. <br />
Each combatant with beak, and pounces press&#8217;d, <br />
In wrathful ire, his adversary&#8217;s breast; <br />
Each falls a victim, to preserve the fame <br />
Of that great hero, whence their being came. <br />
From him their courage, and their name they take, <br />
And, as they liv&#8217;d, they dye for Memnon&#8217;s sake. <br />
Punctual to time, with each revolving year, <br />
In fresh array the champion birds appear; <br />
Again, prepar&#8217;d with vengeful minds, they come <br />
To bleed, in honour of the souldier&#8217;s tomb.</p>
<p>Therefore in others it appear&#8217;d not strange, <br />
To grieve for Hecuba&#8217;s unhappy change: <br />
But poor Aurora had enough to do <br />
With her own loss, to mind another&#8217;s woe; <br />
Who still in tears, her tender nature shews, <br />
Besprinkling all the world with pearly dews.</p>
<p>The Voyage of Aeneas</p>
<p>Troy thus destroy&#8217;d, &#8217;twas still deny&#8217;d by Fate, <br />
The hopes of Troy should perish with the state. <br />
His sire, the son of Cytherea bore, <br />
And household-Gods from burning Ilium&#8217;s shore, <br />
The pious prince (a double duty paid) <br />
Each sacred burthen thro&#8217; the flames convey&#8217;d. <br />
With young Ascanius, and this only prize, <br />
Of heaps of wealth, he from Antandros flies; <br />
But struck with horror, left the Thracian shore, <br />
Stain&#8217;d with the blood of murder&#8217;d Polydore. <br />
The Delian isle receives the banish&#8217;d train, <br />
Driv&#8217;n by kind gales, and favour&#8217;d by the main.</p>
<p>Here pious Anius, priest, and monarch reign&#8217;d, <br />
And either charge, with equal care sustain&#8217;d, <br />
His subjects rul&#8217;d, to Phoebus homage pay&#8217;d, <br />
His God obeying, and by those obey&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The priest displays his hospitable gate, <br />
And shows the riches of his church, and state <br />
The sacred shrubs, which eas&#8217;d Latona&#8217;s pain, <br />
The palm, and olive, and the votive fane. <br />
Here grateful flames with fuming incense fed, <br />
And mingled wine, ambrosial odours shed; <br />
Of slaughter&#8217;d steers the crackling entrails burn&#8217;d: <br />
And then the strangers to the court return&#8217;d.</p>
<p>On beds of tap&#8217;stry plac&#8217;d aloft, they dine <br />
With Ceres&#8217; gift, and flowing bowls of wine; <br />
When thus Anchises spoke, amidst the feast: <br />
Say, mitred monarch, Phoebus&#8217; chosen priest, <br />
Or (e&#8217;er from Troy by cruel Fate expell&#8217;d) <br />
When first mine eyes these sacred walls beheld, <br />
A son, and twice two daughters crown&#8217;d thy bliss? <br />
Or errs my mem&#8217;ry, and I judge amiss?</p>
<p>The royal prophet shook his hoary head, <br />
With snowy fillets bound, and sighing, said: <br />
Thy mem&#8217;ry errs not, prince; thou saw&#8217;st me then, <br />
The happy father of so large a train; <br />
Behold me now (such turns of chance befall <br />
The race of man!), almost bereft of all. <br />
For (ah!) what comfort can my son bestow, <br />
What help afford, to mitigate my woe! <br />
While far from hence, in Andros&#8217; isle he reigns, <br />
(From him so nam&#8217;d) and there my place sustains. <br />
Him Delius praescience gave; the twice-born God <br />
A boon more wond&#8217;rous on the maids bestow&#8217;d. <br />
Whate&#8217;er they touch&#8217;d, he gave them to transmute <br />
(A gift past credit, and above their suit) <br />
To Ceres, Bacchus, and Minerva&#8217;s fruit. <br />
How great their value, and how rich their use, <br />
Whose only touch such treasures could produce!</p>
<p>The dire destroyer of the Trojan reign, <br />
Fierce Agamemnon, such a prize to gain <br />
(A proof we also were design&#8217;d by Fate <br />
To feel the tempest, that o&#8217;erturn&#8217;d your state), <br />
With force superior, and a ruffian crew, <br />
From these weak arms, the helpless virgins drew: <br />
And sternly bad them use the grant divine, <br />
To keep the fleet in corn, and oil, and wine. <br />
Each, as they could, escap&#8217;d: two strove to gain <br />
Euboea&#8217;s isle, and two their brother&#8217;s reign. <br />
The soldier follows, and demands the dames; <br />
If held by force, immediate war proclaims. <br />
Fear conquer&#8217;d Nature in their brother&#8217;s mind, <br />
And gave them up to punishment assign&#8217;d. <br />
Forgive the deed; nor Hector&#8217;s arm was there, <br />
Nor thine, Aeneas, to maintain the war; <br />
Whose only force upheld your Ilium&#8217;s tow&#8217;rs, <br />
For ten long years, against the Grecian pow&#8217;rs. <br />
Prepar&#8217;d to bind their captive arms in bands, <br />
To Heav&#8217;n they rear&#8217;d their yet unfetter&#8217;d hands, <br />
Help, Bacchus, author of the gift, they pray&#8217;d; <br />
The gift&#8217;s great author gave immediate aid; <br />
If such destruction of their human frame <br />
By ways so wond&#8217;rous, may deserve the name; <br />
Nor could I hear, nor can I now relate <br />
Exact, the manner of their alter&#8217;d state; <br />
But this in gen&#8217;ral of my loss I knew, <br />
Transform&#8217;d to doves, on milky plumes they flew, <br />
Such as on Ida&#8217;s mount thy consort&#8217;s chariot drew.</p>
<p>With such discourse, they entertain&#8217;d the feast; <br />
Then rose from table, and withdrew to rest. <br />
The following morn, ere Sol was seen to shine, <br />
Th&#8217; inquiring Trojans sought the sacred shrine; <br />
The mystick Pow&#8217;r commands them to explore <br />
Their ancient mother, and a kindred shore. <br />
Attending to the sea, the gen&#8217;rous prince <br />
Dismiss&#8217;d his guests with rich munificence, <br />
In old Anchises&#8217; hand a sceptre plac&#8217;d, <br />
A vest, and quiver young Ascanius grac&#8217;d, <br />
His sire, a cup; which from th&#8217; Aonian coast, <br />
Ismenian Therses sent his royal host. <br />
Alcon of Myle made what Therses sent, <br />
And carv&#8217;d thereon this ample argument.</p>
<p>A town with sev&#8217;n distinguish&#8217;d gates was shown, <br />
Which spoke its name, and made the city known; <br />
Before it, piles, and tombs, and rising flames, <br />
The rites of death, and quires of mourning dames, <br />
Who bar&#8217;d their breasts, and gave their hair to flow, <br />
The signs of grief, and marks of publick woe. <br />
Their fountains dry&#8217;d, the weeping Naiads mourn&#8217;d, <br />
The trees stood bare, with searing cankers burn&#8217;d, <br />
No herbage cloath&#8217;d the ground, a ragged flock <br />
Of goats half-famish&#8217;d, lick&#8217;d the naked rock, <br />
Of manly courage, and with mind serene, <br />
Orion&#8217;s daughters in the town were seen; <br />
One heav&#8217;d her chest to meet the lifted knife, <br />
One plung&#8217;d the poyniard thro&#8217; the seat of life, <br />
Their country&#8217;s victims; mourns the rescu&#8217;d state, <br />
The bodies burns, and celebrates their Fate. <br />
To save the failure of th&#8217; illustrious line, <br />
From the pale ashes rose, of form divine, <br />
Two gen&#8217;rous youths; these, fame Coronae calls, <br />
Who join the pomp, and mourn their mother&#8217;s falls.</p>
<p>These burnish&#8217;d figures form&#8217;d of antique mold, <br />
Shone on the brass, with rising sculpture bold; <br />
A wreath of gilt Acanthus round the brim was roll&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Nor less expence the Trojan gifts express&#8217;d; <br />
A fuming censer for the royal priest, <br />
A chalice, and a crown of princely cost, <br />
With ruddy gold, and sparkling gems emboss&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Now hoisting sail, to Crete the Trojans stood, <br />
Themselves remembring sprung from Teucer&#8217;s blood; <br />
But Heav&#8217;n forbids, and pestilential Jove <br />
From noxious skies, the wand&#8217;ring navy drove. <br />
Her hundred cities left, from Crete they bore, <br />
And sought the destin&#8217;d land, Ausonia&#8217;s shore; <br />
But toss&#8217;d by storms at either Strophas lay, <br />
&#8216;Till scar&#8217;d by Harpies from the faithless bay. <br />
Then passing onward with a prosp&#8217;rous wind, <br />
Left sly Ulysses&#8217; spacious realms behind; <br />
Ambracia&#8217;s state, in former ages known. <br />
The strife of Gods, the judge transform&#8217;d to stone <br />
They saw; for Actian Phoebus since renown&#8217;d, <br />
Who Caesar&#8217;s arms with naval conquest crown&#8217;d; <br />
Next pass&#8217;d Dodona, wont of old to boast <br />
Her vocal forest; and Chaonia&#8217;s coast, <br />
Where king Molossus&#8217; sons on wings aspir&#8217;d, <br />
And saw secure the harmless fewel fir&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Now to Phaeacia&#8217;s happy isle they came, <br />
For fertile orchards known to early fame; <br />
Epirus past, they next beheld with joy <br />
A second Ilium, and fictitious Troy; <br />
Here Trojan Helenus the sceptre sway&#8217;d, <br />
Who show&#8217;d their fate and mystick truths display&#8217;d. <br />
By him confirm&#8217;d Sicilia&#8217;s isle they reach&#8217;d, <br />
Whose sides to sea three promontories stretch&#8217;d, <br />
Pachynos to the stormy south is plac&#8217;d, <br />
On Lilybaeum blows the gentle west, <br />
Peloro&#8217;s cliffs the northern bear survey, <br />
Who rolls above, and dreads to touch the sea. <br />
By this they steer, and favour&#8217;d by the tide, <br />
Secure by night in Zancle&#8217;s harbour ride.</p>
<p>Here cruel Scylla guards the rocky shore, <br />
And there the waves of loud Charybdis roar: <br />
This sucks, and vomits ships, and bodies drown&#8217;d; <br />
And rav&#8217;nous dogs the womb of that surround, <br />
In face a virgin; and (if ought be true <br />
By bards recorded) once a virgin too.</p>
<p>A train of youths in vain desir&#8217;d her bed; <br />
By sea-nymphs lov&#8217;d, to nymphs of seas she fled; <br />
The maid to these, with female pride, display&#8217;d <br />
Their baffled courtship, and their love betray&#8217;d.</p>
<p>When Galatea thus bespoke the fair <br />
(But first she sigh&#8217;d), while Scylla comb&#8217;d her hair: <br />
You, lovely maid, a gen&#8217;rous race pursues, <br />
Whom safe you may (as now you do) refuse; <br />
To me, tho&#8217; pow&#8217;rful in a num&#8217;rous train <br />
Of sisters, sprung from Gods, who rule the main, <br />
My native seas could scarce a refuge prove, <br />
To shun the fury of the Cyclops&#8217; love,</p>
<p>Tears choak&#8217;d her utt&#8217;rance here; the pity&#8217;ng maid <br />
With marble fingers wip&#8217;d them off, and said:</p>
<p>My dearest Goddess, let thy Scylla know, <br />
(For I am faithful) whence these sorrows flow.</p>
<p>The maid&#8217;s intreaties o&#8217;er the nymph prevail, <br />
Who thus to Scylla tells the mournful tale.</p>
<p>The Story of Acis, Polyphemus and Galatea</p>
<p>Acis, the lovely youth, whose loss I mourn, <br />
From Faunus, and the nymph Symethis born, <br />
Was both his parents&#8217; pleasure; but, to me <br />
Was all that love could make a lover be. <br />
The Gods our minds in mutual bands did join: <br />
I was his only joy, and he was mine. <br />
Now sixteen summers the sweet youth had seen; <br />
And doubtful down began to shade his chin: <br />
When Polyphemus first disturb&#8217;d our joy; <br />
And lov&#8217;d me fiercely, as I lov&#8217;d the boy. <br />
Ask not which passion in my soul was high&#8217;r, <br />
My last aversion, or my first desire: <br />
Nor this the greater was, nor that the less; <br />
Both were alike, for both were in excess. <br />
Thee, Venus, thee both Heav&#8217;n, and Earth obey; <br />
Immense thy pow&#8217;r, and boundless is thy sway. <br />
The Cyclops, who defy&#8217;d th&#8217; aetherial throne, <br />
And thought no thunder louder than his own, <br />
The terror of the woods, and wilder far <br />
Than wolves in plains, or bears in forests are, <br />
Th&#8217; inhuman host, who made his bloody feasts <br />
On mangl&#8217;d members of his butcher&#8217;d guests, <br />
Yet felt the force of love, and fierce desire, <br />
And burnt for me, with unrelenting fire. <br />
Forgot his caverns, and his woolly care, <br />
Assum&#8217;d the softness of a lover&#8217;s air; <br />
And comb&#8217;d, with teeth of rakes, his rugged hair. <br />
Now with a crooked scythe his beard he sleeks; <br />
And mows the stubborn stubble of his cheeks: <br />
Now in the crystal stream he looks, to try <br />
His simagres, and rowls his glaring eye. <br />
His cruelty, and thirst of blood are lost; <br />
And ships securely sail along the coast.</p>
<p>The prophet Telemus (arriv&#8217;d by chance <br />
Where Aetna&#8217;s summets to the seas advance, <br />
Who mark&#8217;d the tracts of every bird that flew, <br />
And sure presages from their flying drew) <br />
Foretold the Cyclops, that Ulysses&#8217; hand <br />
In his broad eye shou&#8217;d thrust a flaming brand. <br />
The giant, with a scornful grin, reply&#8217;d, <br />
Vain augur, thou hast falsely prophesy&#8217;d; <br />
Already love his flaming brand has tost; <br />
Looking on two fair eyes, my sight I lost, <br />
Thus, warn&#8217;d in vain, with stalking pace he strode, <br />
And stamp&#8217;d the margin of the briny flood <br />
With heavy steps; and weary, sought agen <br />
The cool retirement of his gloomy den.</p>
<p>A promontory, sharp&#8217;ning by degrees, <br />
Ends in a wedge, and overlooks the seas: <br />
On either side, below, the water flows; <br />
This airy walk the giant lover chose. <br />
Here on the midst he sate; his flocks, unled, <br />
Their shepherd follow&#8217;d, and securely fed. <br />
A pine so burly, and of length so vast, <br />
That sailing ships requir&#8217;d it for a mast, <br />
He wielded for a staff, his steps to guide: <br />
But laid it by, his whistle while he try&#8217;d. <br />
A hundred reeds of a prodigious growth, <br />
Scarce made a pipe, proportion&#8217;d to his mouth: <br />
Which when he gave it wind, the rocks around, <br />
And watry plains, the dreadful hiss resound. <br />
I heard the ruffian-shepherd rudely blow, <br />
Where, in a hollow cave, I sat below; <br />
On Acis&#8217; bosom I my head reclin&#8217;d: <br />
And still preserve the poem in my mind.</p>
<p>Oh lovely Galatea, whiter far <br />
Than falling snows, and rising lillies are; <br />
More flowry than the meads, as chrystal bright: <br />
Erect as alders, and of equal height: <br />
More wanton than a kid, more sleek thy skin, <br />
Than orient shells, that on the shores are seen, <br />
Than apples fairer, when the boughs they lade; <br />
Pleasing, as winter suns, or summer shade: <br />
More grateful to the sight, than goodly plains; <br />
And softer to the touch, than down of swans; <br />
Or curds new turn&#8217;d; and sweeter to the taste <br />
Than swelling grapes, that to the vintage haste: <br />
More clear than ice, or running streams, that stray <br />
Through garden plots, but ah! more swift than they.</p>
<p>Yet, Galatea, harder to be broke <br />
Than bullocks, unreclaim&#8217;d, to bear the yoke, <br />
And far more stubborn, than the knotted oak: <br />
Like sliding streams, impossible to hold; <br />
Like them, fallacious, like their fountains, cold. <br />
More warping, than the willow, to decline <br />
My warm embrace, more brittle, than the vine; <br />
Immovable, and fixt in thy disdain: <br />
Tough, as these rocks, and of a harder grain. <br />
More violent, than is the rising flood; <br />
And the prais&#8217;d peacock is not half so proud. <br />
Fierce, as the fire, and sharp, as thistles are, <br />
And more outragious, than a mother-bear: <br />
Deaf, as the billows to the vows I make; <br />
And more revengeful, than a trodden snake. <br />
In swiftness fleeter, than the flying hind, <br />
Or driven tempests, or the driving wind. <br />
All other faults, with patience I can bear; <br />
But swiftness is the vice I only fear.</p>
<p>Yet if you knew me well, you wou&#8217;d not shun <br />
My love, but to my wish&#8217;d embraces run: <br />
Wou&#8217;d languish in your turn, and court my stay; <br />
And much repent of your unwise delay.</p>
<p>My palace, in the living rock, is made <br />
By Nature&#8217;s hand; a spacious pleasing shade: <br />
Which neither heat can pierce, nor cold invade. <br />
My garden fill&#8217;d with fruits you may behold, <br />
And grapes in clusters, imitating gold; <br />
Some blushing bunches of a purple hue: <br />
And these, and those, are all reserv&#8217;d for you. <br />
Red strawberries, in shades, expecting stand, <br />
Proud to be gather&#8217;d by so white a hand. <br />
Autumnal cornels latter fruit provide; <br />
And plumbs, to tempt you, turn their glossy side: <br />
Not those of common kinds; but such alone, <br />
As in Phaeacian orchards might have grown: <br />
Nor chestnuts shall be wanting to your food, <br />
Nor garden-fruits, nor wildings of the wood; <br />
The laden boughs for you alone shall bear; <br />
And yours shall be the product of the year.</p>
<p>The flocks you see, are all my own; beside <br />
The rest that woods, and winding vallies hide; <br />
And those that folded in the caves abide. <br />
Ask not the numbers of my growing store; <br />
Who knows how many, knows he has no more. <br />
Nor will I praise my cattle; trust not me, <br />
But judge your self, and pass your own decree: <br />
Behold their swelling dugs; the sweepy weight <br />
Of ewes, that sink beneath the milky freight; <br />
In the warm folds their tender lambkins lye; <br />
Apart from kids, that call with human cry. <br />
New milk in nut-brown bowls is duely serv&#8217;d <br />
For daily drink; the rest for cheese reserv&#8217;d. <br />
Nor are these household dainties all my store: <br />
The fields, and forests will afford us more; <br />
The deer, the hare, the goat, the savage boar. <br />
All sorts of ven&#8217;son; and of birds the best; <br />
A pair of turtles taken from the nest. <br />
I walk&#8217;d the mountains, and two cubs I found <br />
(Whose dam had left &#8216;em on the naked ground), <br />
So like, that no distinction could be seen: <br />
So pretty, they were presents for a queen; <br />
And so they shall; I took them both away; <br />
And keep, to be companions of your play.</p>
<p>Oh raise, fair nymph, your beauteous face above <br />
The waves; nor scorn my presents, and my love. <br />
Come, Galatea, come, and view my face; <br />
I late beheld it, in the watry glass; <br />
And found it lovelier, than I fear&#8217;d it was. <br />
Survey my towring stature, and my size: <br />
Not Jove, the Jove you dream, that rules the skies, <br />
Bears such a bulk, or is so largely spread: <br />
My locks (the plenteous harvest of my head) <br />
Hang o&#8217;er my manly face; and dangling down, <br />
As with a shady grove, my shoulders crown. <br />
Nor think, because my limbs and body bear <br />
A thick-set underwood of bristling hair, <br />
My shape deform&#8217;d; what fouler sight can be, <br />
Than the bald branches of a leafless tree? <br />
Foul is the steed without a flowing mane: <br />
And birds, without their feathers, and their train. <br />
Wool decks the sheep; and Man receives a grace <br />
From bushy limbs, and from a bearded face. <br />
My forehead with a single eye is fill&#8217;d, <br />
Round, as a ball, and ample, as a shield. <br />
The glorious lamp of Heav&#8217;n, the radiant sun, <br />
Is Nature&#8217;s eye; and she&#8217;s content with one. <br />
Add, that my father sways your seas, and I, <br />
Like you, am of the watry family. <br />
I make you his, in making you my own; <br />
You I adore; and kneel to you alone: <br />
Jove, with his fabled thunder, I despise, <br />
And only fear the lightning of your eyes. <br />
Frown not, fair nymph; yet I cou&#8217;d bear to be <br />
Disdain&#8217;d, if others were disdain&#8217;d with me. <br />
But to repulse the Cyclops, and prefer <br />
The love of Acis (Heav&#8217;ns!) I cannot bear. <br />
But let the stripling please himself; nay more, <br />
Please you, tho&#8217; that&#8217;s the thing I most abhor; <br />
The boy shall find, if e&#8217;er we cope in fight, <br />
These giant limbs, endu&#8217;d with giant might. <br />
His living bowels from his belly torn, <br />
And scatter&#8217;d limbs shall on the flood be born: <br />
Thy flood, ungrateful nymph; and fate shall find, <br />
That way for thee, and Acis to be join&#8217;d. <br />
For oh! I burn with love, and thy disdain <br />
Augments at once my passion, and my pain. <br />
Translated Aetna flames within my heart, <br />
And thou, inhuman, wilt not ease my smart.</p>
<p>Lamenting thus in vain, he rose, and strode <br />
With furious paces to the neighb&#8217;ring wood: <br />
Restless his feet, distracted was his walk; <br />
Mad were his motions, and confus&#8217;d his talk. <br />
Mad, as the vanquish&#8217;d bull, when forc&#8217;d to yield <br />
His lovely mistress, and forsake the field.</p>
<p>Thus far unseen I saw: when fatal chance, <br />
His looks directing, with a sudden glance, <br />
Acis and I were to his sight betray&#8217;d; <br />
Where, nought suspecting, we securely play&#8217;d. <br />
From his wide mouth a bellowing cry he cast, <br />
I see, I see; but this shall be your last: <br />
A roar so loud made Aetna to rebound: <br />
And all the Cyclops labour&#8217;d in the sound. <br />
Affrighted with his monstrous voice, I fled, <br />
And in the neighbouring ocean plung&#8217;d my head. <br />
Poor Acis turn&#8217;d his back, and Help, he cry&#8217;d, <br />
Help, Galatea, help, my parent Gods, <br />
And take me dying to your deep abodes. <br />
The Cyclops follow&#8217;d; but he sent before <br />
A rib, which from the living rock he tore: <br />
Though but an angle reach&#8217;d him of the stone, <br />
The mighty fragment was enough alone, <br />
To crush all Acis; &#8217;twas too late to save, <br />
But what the Fates allow&#8217;d to give, I gave: <br />
That Acis to his lineage should return; <br />
And rowl, among the river Gods, his urn. <br />
Straight issu&#8217;d from the stone a stream of blood; <br />
Which lost the purple, mingling with the flood, <br />
Then, like a troubled torrent, it appear&#8217;d: <br />
The torrent too, in little space, was clear&#8217;d. <br />
The stone was cleft, and through the yawning chink <br />
New reeds arose, on the new river&#8217;s brink. <br />
The rock, from out its hollow womb, disclos&#8217;d <br />
A sound like water in its course oppos&#8217;d, <br />
When (wond&#8217;rous to behold), full in the flood, <br />
Up starts a youth, and navel high he stood. <br />
Horns from his temples rise; and either horn <br />
Thick wreaths of reeds (his native growth) adorn. <br />
Were not his stature taller than before, <br />
His bulk augmented, and his beauty more, <br />
His colour blue; for Acis he might pass: <br />
And Acis chang&#8217;d into a stream he was, <br />
But mine no more; he rowls along the plains <br />
With rapid motion, and his name retains.</p>
<p>The Story of Glaucus and Scylla</p>
<p>Here ceas&#8217;d the nymph; the fair assembly broke, <br />
The sea-green Nereids to the waves betook: <br />
While Scylla, fearful of the wide-spread main, <br />
Swift to the safer shore returns again. <br />
There o&#8217;er the sandy margin, unarray&#8217;d, <br />
With printless footsteps flies the bounding maid; <br />
Or in some winding creek&#8217;s secure retreat <br />
She baths her weary limbs, and shuns the noonday&#8217;s heat. <br />
Her Glaucus saw, as o&#8217;er the deep he rode, <br />
New to the seas, and late receiv&#8217;d a God. <br />
He saw, and languish&#8217;d for the virgin&#8217;s love; <br />
With many an artful blandishment he strove <br />
Her flight to hinder, and her fears remove. <br />
The more he sues, the more she wings her flight, <br />
And nimbly gains a neighb&#8217;ring mountain&#8217;s height. <br />
Steep shelving to the margin of the flood, <br />
A neighb&#8217;ring mountain bare, and woodless stood; <br />
Here, by the place secur&#8217;d, her steps she stay&#8217;d, <br />
And, trembling still, her lover&#8217;s form survey&#8217;d. <br />
His shape, his hue, her troubled sense appall, <br />
And dropping locks that o&#8217;er his shoulders fall; <br />
She sees his face divine, and manly brow, <br />
End in a fish&#8217;s wreathy tail below: <br />
She sees, and doubts within her anxious mind, <br />
Whether he comes of God, or monster kind. <br />
This Glaucus soon perceiv&#8217;d; and, Oh! forbear <br />
(His hand supporting on a rock lay near), <br />
Forbear, he cry&#8217;d, fond maid, this needless fear. <br />
Nor fish am I, nor monster of the main, <br />
But equal with the watry Gods I reign; <br />
Nor Proteus, nor Palaemon me excell, <br />
Nor he whose breath inspires the sounding shell. <br />
My birth, &#8217;tis true, I owe to mortal race, <br />
And I my self but late a mortal was: <br />
Ev&#8217;n then in seas, and seas alone, I joy&#8217;d; <br />
The seas my hours, and all my cares employ&#8217;d, <br />
In meshes now the twinkling prey I drew; <br />
Now skilfully the slender line I threw, <br />
And silent sat the moving float to view. <br />
Not far from shore, there lies a verdant mead, <br />
With herbage half, and half with water spread: <br />
There, nor the horned heifers browsing stray, <br />
Nor shaggy kids, nor wanton lambkins play; <br />
There, nor the sounding bees their nectar cull, <br />
Nor rural swains their genial chaplets pull, <br />
Nor flocks, nor herds, nor mowers haunt the place, <br />
To crop the flow&#8217;rs, or cut the bushy grass: <br />
Thither, sure first of living race came I, <br />
And sat by chance, my dropping nets to dry. <br />
My scaly prize, in order all display&#8217;d, <br />
By number on the greensward there I lay&#8217;d, <br />
My captives, whom or in my nets I took, <br />
Or hung unwary on my wily hook. <br />
Strange to behold! yet what avails a lye? <br />
I saw &#8216;em bite the grass, as I sate by; <br />
Then sudden darting o&#8217;er the verdant plain, <br />
They spread their finns, as in their native main: <br />
I paus&#8217;d, with wonder struck, while all my prey <br />
Left their new master, and regain&#8217;d the sea. <br />
Amaz&#8217;d, within my secret self I sought, <br />
What God, what herb the miracle had wrought: <br />
But sure no herbs have pow&#8217;r like this, I cry&#8217;d; <br />
And strait I pluck&#8217;d some neighb&#8217;ring herbs, and try&#8217;d. <br />
Scarce had I bit, and prov&#8217;d the wond&#8217;rous taste, <br />
When strong convulsions shook my troubled breast; <br />
I felt my heart grow fond of something strange, <br />
And my whole Nature lab&#8217;ring with a change. <br />
Restless I grew, and ev&#8217;ry place forsook, <br />
And still upon the seas I bent my look. <br />
Farewel for ever! farewel, land! I said; <br />
And plung&#8217;d amidst the waves my sinking head. <br />
The gentle Pow&#8217;rs, who that low empire keep, <br />
Receiv&#8217;d me as a brother of the deep; <br />
To Tethys, and to Ocean old, they pray <br />
To purge my mortal earthy parts away. <br />
The watry parents to their suit agreed, <br />
And thrice nine times a secret charm they read, <br />
Then with lustrations purify my limbs, <br />
And bid me bathe beneath a hundred streams: <br />
A hundred streams from various fountains run, <br />
And on my head at once come rushing down. <br />
Thus far each passage I remember well, <br />
And faithfully thus far the tale I tell; <br />
But then oblivion dark, on all my senses fell. <br />
Again at length my thought reviving came, <br />
When I no longer found my self the same; <br />
Then first this sea-green beard I felt to grow, <br />
And these large honours on my spreading brow; <br />
My long-descending locks the billows sweep, <br />
And my broad shoulders cleave the yielding deep; <br />
My fishy tail, my arms of azure hue, <br />
And ev&#8217;ry part divinely chang&#8217;d, I view. <br />
But what avail these useless honours now? <br />
What joys can immortality bestow? <br />
What, tho&#8217; our Nereids all my form approve? <br />
What boots it, while fair Scylla scorns my love?</p>
<p>Thus far the God; and more he wou&#8217;d have said; <br />
When from his presence flew the ruthless maid. <br />
Stung with repulse, in such disdainful sort, <br />
He seeks Titanian Circe&#8217;s horrid court. </p>
