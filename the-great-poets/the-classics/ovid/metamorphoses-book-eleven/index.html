				<p>The Death of Orpheus</p>
<p>Here, while the Thracian bard&#8217;s enchanting strain <br />
Sooths beasts, and woods, and all the listn&#8217;ing plain, <br />
The female Bacchanals, devoutly mad, <br />
In shaggy skins, like savage creatures, clad, <br />
Warbling in air perceiv&#8217;d his lovely lay, <br />
And from a rising ground beheld him play. <br />
When one, the wildest, with dishevel&#8217;d hair, <br />
That loosely stream&#8217;d, and ruffled in the air; <br />
Soon as her frantick eye the lyrist spy&#8217;d, <br />
See, see! the hater of our sex, she cry&#8217;d. <br />
Then at his face her missive javelin sent, <br />
Which whiz&#8217;d along, and brusht him as it went; <br />
But the soft wreathes of ivy twisted round, <br />
Prevent a deep impression of the wound. <br />
Another, for a weapon, hurls a stone, <br />
Which, by the sound subdu&#8217;d as soon as thrown, <br />
Falls at his feet, and with a seeming sense <br />
Implores his pardon for its late offence. <br />
But now their frantick rage unbounded grows, <br />
Turns all to madness, and no measure knows: <br />
Yet this the charms of musick might subdue, <br />
But that, with all its charms, is conquer&#8217;d too; <br />
In louder strains their hideous yellings rise, <br />
And squeaking horn-pipes eccho thro&#8217; the skies, <br />
Which, in hoarse consort with the drum, confound <br />
The moving lyre, and ev&#8217;ry gentle sound: <br />
Then &#8217;twas the deafen&#8217;d stones flew on with speed, <br />
And saw, unsooth&#8217;d, their tuneful poet bleed. <br />
The birds, the beasts, and all the savage crew <br />
Which the sweet lyrist to attention drew, <br />
Now, by the female mob&#8217;s more furious rage, <br />
Are driv&#8217;n, and forc&#8217;d to quit the shady stage. <br />
Next their fierce hands the bard himself assail, <br />
Nor can his song against their wrath prevail: <br />
They flock, like birds, when in a clustring flight, <br />
By day they chase the boding fowl of night. <br />
So crowded amphitheatres survey <br />
The stag, to greedy dogs a future prey. <br />
Their steely javelins, which soft curls entwine <br />
Of budding tendrils from the leafy vine, <br />
For sacred rites of mild religion made, <br />
Are flung promiscuous at the poet&#8217;s head. <br />
Those clods of earth or flints discharge, and these <br />
Hurl prickly branches sliver&#8217;d from the trees. <br />
And, lest their passion shou&#8217;d be unsupply&#8217;d, <br />
The rabble crew, by chance, at distance spy&#8217;d <br />
Where oxen, straining at the heavy yoke, <br />
The fallow&#8217;d field with slow advances broke; <br />
Nigh which the brawny peasants dug the soil, <br />
Procuring food with long laborious toil. <br />
These, when they saw the ranting throng draw near, <br />
Quitted their tools, and fled, possest with fear. <br />
Long spades, and rakes of mighty size were found, <br />
Carelesly left upon the broken ground. <br />
With these the furious lunaticks engage, <br />
And first the lab&#8217;ring oxen feel their rage; <br />
Then to the poet they return with speed, <br />
Whose fate was, past prevention, now decreed: <br />
In vain he lifts his suppliant hands, in vain <br />
He tries, before, his never-failing strain. <br />
And, from those sacred lips, whose thrilling sound <br />
Fierce tygers, and insensate rocks cou&#8217;d wound, <br />
Ah Gods! how moving was the mournful sight! <br />
To see the fleeting soul now take its flight. <br />
Thee the soft warblers of the feather&#8217;d kind <br />
Bewail&#8217;d; for thee thy savage audience pin&#8217;d; <br />
Those rocks and woods that oft thy strain had led, <br />
Mourn for their charmer, and lament him dead; <br />
And drooping trees their leafy glories shed. <br />
Naids and Dryads with dishevel&#8217;d hair <br />
Promiscuous weep, and scarfs of sable wear; <br />
Nor cou&#8217;d the river-Gods conceal their moan, <br />
But with new floods of tears augment their own. <br />
His mangled limbs lay scatter&#8217;d all around, <br />
His head, and harp a better fortune found; <br />
In Hebrus&#8217; streams they gently roul&#8217;d along, <br />
And sooth&#8217;d the waters with a mournful song. <br />
Soft deadly notes the lifeless tongue inspire, <br />
A doleful tune sounds from the floating lyre; <br />
The hollows banks in solemn consort mourn, <br />
And the sad strain in ecchoing groans return. <br />
Now with the current to the sea they glide, <br />
Born by the billows of the briny tide; <br />
And driv&#8217;n where waves round rocky Lesbos roar, <br />
They strand, and lodge upon Methymna&#8217;s shore.</p>
<p>But here, when landed on the foreign soil, <br />
A venom&#8217;d snake, the product of the isle <br />
Attempts the head, and sacred locks embru&#8217;d <br />
With clotted gore, and still fresh-dropping blood. <br />
Phoebus, at last, his kind protection gives, <br />
And from the fact the greedy monster drives: <br />
Whose marbled jaws his impious crime atone, <br />
Still grinning ghastly, tho&#8217; transform&#8217;d to stone.</p>
<p>His ghost flies downward to the Stygian shore, <br />
And knows the places it had seen before: <br />
Among the shadows of the pious train <br />
He finds Eurydice, and loves again; <br />
With pleasure views the beauteous phantom&#8217;s charms, <br />
And clasps her in his unsubstantial arms. <br />
There side by side they unmolested walk, <br />
Or pass their blissful hours in pleasing talk; <br />
Aft or before the bard securely goes, <br />
And, without danger, can review his spouse.</p>
<p>The Thracian Women transform&#8217;d to Trees</p>
<p>Bacchus, resolving to revenge the wrong, <br />
Of Orpheus murder&#8217;d, on the madding throng, <br />
Decreed that each accomplice dame should stand <br />
Fix&#8217;d by the roots along the conscious land. <br />
Their wicked feet, that late so nimbly ran <br />
To wreak their malice on the guiltless man, <br />
Sudden with twisted ligatures were bound, <br />
Like trees, deep planted in the turfy ground. <br />
And, as the fowler with his subtle gins, <br />
His feather&#8217;d captives by the feet entwines, <br />
That flutt&#8217;ring pant, and struggle to get loose, <br />
Yet only closer draw the fatal noose; <br />
So these were caught; and, as they strove in vain <br />
To quit the place, they but encreas&#8217;d their pain. <br />
They flounce and toil, yet find themselves controul&#8217;d; <br />
The root, tho&#8217; pliant, toughly keeps its hold. <br />
In vain their toes and feet they look to find, <br />
For ev&#8217;n their shapely legs are cloath&#8217;d with rind. <br />
One smites her thighs with a lamenting stroke, <br />
And finds the flesh transform&#8217;d to solid oak; <br />
Another, with surprize, and grief distrest, <br />
Lays on above, but beats a wooden breast. <br />
A rugged bark their softer neck invades, <br />
Their branching arms shoot up delightful shades; <br />
At once they seem, and are, a real grove, <br />
With mossy trunks below, and verdant leaves above.</p>
<p>The Fable of Midas</p>
<p>Nor this suffic&#8217;d; the God&#8217;s disgust remains, <br />
And he resolves to quit their hated plains; <br />
The vineyards of Tymole ingross his care, <br />
And, with a better choir, he fixes there; <br />
Where the smooth streams of clear Pactolus roll&#8217;d, <br />
Then undistinguish&#8217;d for its sands of gold. <br />
The satyrs with the nymphs, his usual throng, <br />
Come to salute their God, and jovial danc&#8217;d along. <br />
Silenus only miss&#8217;d; for while he reel&#8217;d, <br />
Feeble with age, and wine, about the field, <br />
The hoary drunkard had forgot his way, <br />
And to the Phrygian clowns became a prey; <br />
Who to king Midas drag the captive God, <br />
While on his totty pate the wreaths of ivy nod.</p>
<p>Midas from Orpheus had been taught his lore, <br />
And knew the rites of Bacchus long before. <br />
He, when he saw his venerable guest, <br />
In honour of the God ordain&#8217;d a feast. <br />
Ten days in course, with each continu&#8217;d night, <br />
Were spent in genial mirth, and brisk delight: <br />
Then on th&#8217; eleventh, when with brighter ray <br />
Phosphor had chac&#8217;d the fading stars away, <br />
The king thro&#8217; Lydia&#8217;s fields young Bacchus sought, <br />
And to the God his foster-father brought. <br />
Pleas&#8217;d with the welcome sight, he bids him soon <br />
But name his wish, and swears to grant the boon. <br />
A glorious offer! yet but ill bestow&#8217;d <br />
On him whose choice so little judgment show&#8217;d. <br />
Give me, says he (nor thought he ask&#8217;d too much), <br />
That with my body whatsoe&#8217;er I touch, <br />
Chang&#8217;d from the nature which it held of old, <br />
May be converted into yellow gold. <br />
He had his wish; but yet the God repin&#8217;d, <br />
To think the fool no better wish could find.</p>
<p>But the brave king departed from the place, <br />
With smiles of gladness sparkling in his face: <br />
Nor could contain, but, as he took his way, <br />
Impatient longs to make the first essay. <br />
Down from a lowly branch a twig he drew, <br />
The twig strait glitter&#8217;d with a golden hue: <br />
He takes a stone, the stone was turn&#8217;d to gold; <br />
A clod he touches, and the crumbling mold <br />
Acknowledg&#8217;d soon the great transforming pow&#8217;r, <br />
In weight and substance like a mass of ore. <br />
He pluck&#8217;d the corn, and strait his grasp appears <br />
Fill&#8217;d with a bending tuft of golden ears. <br />
An apple next he takes, and seems to hold <br />
The bright Hesperian vegetable gold. <br />
His hand he careless on a pillar lays. <br />
With shining gold the fluted pillars blaze: <br />
And while he washes, as the servants pour, <br />
His touch converts the stream to Danae&#8217;s show&#8217;r.</p>
<p>To see these miracles so finely wrought, <br />
Fires with transporting joy his giddy thought. <br />
The ready slaves prepare a sumptuous board, <br />
Spread with rich dainties for their happy lord; <br />
Whose pow&#8217;rful hands the bread no sooner hold, <br />
But its whole substance is transform&#8217;d to gold: <br />
Up to his mouth he lifts the sav&#8217;ry meat, <br />
Which turns to gold as he attempts to eat: <br />
His patron&#8217;s noble juice of purple hue, <br />
Touch&#8217;d by his lips, a gilded cordial grew; <br />
Unfit for drink, and wondrous to behold, <br />
It trickles from his jaws a fluid gold.</p>
<p>The rich poor fool, confounded with surprize, <br />
Starving in all his various plenty lies: <br />
Sick of his wish, he now detests the pow&#8217;r, <br />
For which he ask&#8217;d so earnestly before; <br />
Amidst his gold with pinching famine curst; <br />
And justly tortur&#8217;d with an equal thirst. <br />
At last his shining arms to Heav&#8217;n he rears, <br />
And in distress, for refuge, flies to pray&#8217;rs. <br />
O father Bacchus, I have sinn&#8217;d, he cry&#8217;d, <br />
And foolishly thy gracious gift apply&#8217;d; <br />
Thy pity now, repenting, I implore; <br />
Oh! may I feel the golden plague no more.</p>
<p>The hungry wretch, his folly thus confest, <br />
Touch&#8217;d the kind deity&#8217;s good-natur&#8217;d breast; <br />
The gentle God annull&#8217;d his first decree, <br />
And from the cruel compact set him free. <br />
But then, to cleanse him quite from further harm, <br />
And to dilute the relicks of the charm, <br />
He bids him seek the stream that cuts the land <br />
Nigh where the tow&#8217;rs of Lydian Sardis stand; <br />
Then trace the river to the fountain head, <br />
And meet it rising from its rocky bed; <br />
There, as the bubling tide pours forth amain, <br />
To plunge his body in, and wash away the stain. <br />
The king instructed to the fount retires, <br />
But with the golden charm the stream inspires: <br />
For while this quality the man forsakes, <br />
An equal pow&#8217;r the limpid water takes; <br />
Informs with veins of gold the neighb&#8217;ring land, <br />
And glides along a bed of golden sand.</p>
<p>Now loathing wealth, th&#8217; occasion of his woes, <br />
Far in the woods he sought a calm repose; <br />
In caves and grottos, where the nymphs resort, <br />
And keep with mountain Pan their sylvan court. <br />
Ah! had he left his stupid soul behind! <br />
But his condition alter&#8217;d not his mind.</p>
<p>For where high Tmolus rears his shady brow, <br />
And from his cliffs surveys the seas below, <br />
In his descent, by Sardis bounded here, <br />
By the small confines of Hypaepa there, <br />
Pan to the nymphs his frolick ditties play&#8217;d, <br />
Tuning his reeds beneath the chequer&#8217;d shade. <br />
The nymphs are pleas&#8217;d, the boasting sylvan plays, <br />
And speaks with slight of great Apollo&#8217;s lays. <br />
Tmolus was arbiter; the boaster still <br />
Accepts the tryal with unequal skill. <br />
The venerable judge was seated high <br />
On his own hill, that seem&#8217;d to touch the sky. <br />
Above the whisp&#8217;ring trees his head he rears, <br />
From their encumbring boughs to free his ears; <br />
A wreath of oak alone his temples bound, <br />
The pendant acorns loosely dangled round. <br />
In me your judge, says he, there&#8217;s no delay: <br />
Then bids the goatherd God begin, and play. <br />
Pan tun&#8217;d the pipe, and with his rural song <br />
Pleas&#8217;d the low taste of all the vulgar throng; <br />
Such songs a vulgar judgment mostly please, <br />
Midas was there, and Midas judg&#8217;d with these.</p>
<p>The mountain sire with grave deportment now <br />
To Phoebus turns his venerable brow: <br />
And, as he turns, with him the listning wood <br />
In the same posture of attention stood. <br />
The God his own Parnassian laurel crown&#8217;d, <br />
And in a wreath his golden tresses bound, <br />
Graceful his purple mantle swept the ground. <br />
High on the left his iv&#8217;ry lute he rais&#8217;d, <br />
The lute, emboss&#8217;d with glitt&#8217;ring jewels, blaz&#8217;d <br />
In his right hand he nicely held the quill, <br />
His easy posture spoke a master&#8217;s skill. <br />
The strings he touch&#8217;d with more than human art, <br />
Which pleas&#8217;d the judge&#8217;s ear, and sooth&#8217;d his heart; <br />
Who soon judiciously the palm decreed, <br />
And to the lute postpon&#8217;d the squeaking reed.</p>
<p>All, with applause, the rightful sentence heard, <br />
Midas alone dissatisfy&#8217;d appear&#8217;d; <br />
To him unjustly giv&#8217;n the judgment seems, <br />
For Pan&#8217;s barbarick notes he most esteems. <br />
The lyrick God, who thought his untun&#8217;d ear <br />
Deserv&#8217;d but ill a human form to wear, <br />
Of that deprives him, and supplies the place <br />
With some more fit, and of an ampler space: <br />
Fix&#8217;d on his noddle an unseemly pair, <br />
Flagging, and large, and full of whitish hair; <br />
Without a total change from what he was, <br />
Still in the man preserves the simple ass.</p>
<p>He, to conceal the scandal of the deed, <br />
A purple turbant folds about his head; <br />
Veils the reproach from publick view, and fears <br />
The laughing world would spy his monstrous ears. <br />
One trusty barber-slave, that us&#8217;d to dress <br />
His master&#8217;s hair, when lengthen&#8217;d to excess, <br />
The mighty secret knew, but knew alone, <br />
And, tho&#8217; impatient, durst not make it known. <br />
Restless, at last, a private place he found, <br />
Then dug a hole, and told it to the ground; <br />
In a low whisper he reveal&#8217;d the case, <br />
And cover&#8217;d in the earth, and silent left the place.</p>
<p>In time, of trembling reeds a plenteous crop <br />
From the confided furrow sprouted up; <br />
Which, high advancing with the ripening year, <br />
Made known the tiller, and his fruitless care: <br />
For then the rustling blades, and whisp&#8217;ring wind, <br />
To tell th&#8217; important secret, both combin&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The Building of Troy</p>
<p>Phoebus, with full revenge, from Tmolus flies, <br />
Darts thro&#8217; the air, and cleaves the liquid skies; <br />
Near Hellespont he lights, and treads the plains <br />
Where great Laomedon sole monarch reigns; <br />
Where, built between the two projecting strands, <br />
To Panomphaean Jove an altar stands. <br />
Here first aspiring thoughts the king employ, <br />
To found the lofty tow&#8217;rs of future Troy. <br />
The work, from schemes magnificent begun, <br />
At vast expence was slowly carry&#8217;d on: <br />
Which Phoebus seeing, with the trident God <br />
Who rules the swelling surges with his nod, <br />
Assuming each a mortal shape, combine <br />
At a set price to finish his design. <br />
The work was built; the king their price denies, <br />
And his injustice backs with perjuries. <br />
This Neptune cou&#8217;d not brook, but drove the main, <br />
A mighty deluge, o&#8217;er the Phrygian plain: <br />
&#8216;Twas all a sea; the waters of the deep <br />
From ev&#8217;ry vale the copious harvest sweep; <br />
The briny billows overflow the soil, <br />
Ravage the fields, and mock the plowman&#8217;s toil.</p>
<p>Nor this appeas&#8217;d the God&#8217;s revengeful mind, <br />
For still a greater plague remains behind; <br />
A huge sea-monster lodges on the sands, <br />
And the king&#8217;s daughter for his prey demands. <br />
To him that sav&#8217;d the damsel, was decreed <br />
A set of horses of the Sun&#8217;s fine breed: <br />
But when Alcides from the rock unty&#8217;d <br />
The trembling fair, the ransom was deny&#8217;d. <br />
He, in revenge, the new-built walls attack&#8217;d, <br />
And the twice-perjur&#8217;d city bravely sack&#8217;d. <br />
Telamon aided, and in justice shar&#8217;d <br />
Part of the plunder as his due reward: <br />
The princess, rescu&#8217;d late, with all her charms, <br />
Hesione, was yielded to his arms; <br />
For Peleus, with a Goddess-bride, was more <br />
Proud of his spouse, than of his birth before: <br />
Grandsons to Jove there might be more than one, <br />
But he the Goddess had enjoy&#8217;d alone.</p>
<p>The Story of Thetis and Peleus</p>
<p>For Proteus thus to virgin Thetis said, <br />
Fair Goddess of the waves, consent to wed, <br />
And take some spritely lover to your bed. <br />
A son you&#8217;ll have, the terror of the field, <br />
To whom in fame, and pow&#8217;r his sire shall yield.</p>
<p>Jove, who ador&#8217;d the nymph with boundless love, <br />
Did from his breast the dangerous flame remove. <br />
He knew the Fates, nor car&#8217;d to raise up one, <br />
Whose fame and greatness should eclipse his own, <br />
On happy Peleus he bestow&#8217;d her charms, <br />
And bless&#8217;d his grandson in the Goddess&#8217; arms:</p>
<p>A silent creek Thessalia&#8217;s coast can show; <br />
Two arms project, and shape it like a bow; <br />
&#8216;Twould make a bay, but the transparent tide <br />
Does scarce the yellow-gravell&#8217;d bottom hide; <br />
For the quick eye may thro&#8217; the liquid wave <br />
A firm unweedy level beach perceive. <br />
A grove of fragrant myrtle near it grows, <br />
Whose boughs, tho&#8217; thick, a beauteous grot disclose; <br />
The well-wrought fabrick, to discerning eyes, <br />
Rather by art than Nature seems to rise. <br />
A bridled dolphin oft fair Thetis bore <br />
To this her lov&#8217;d retreat, her fav&#8217;rite shore. <br />
Here Peleus seiz&#8217;d her, slumbring while she lay, <br />
And urg&#8217;d his suit with all that love could say: <br />
But when he found her obstinately coy, <br />
Resolv&#8217;d to force her, and command the joy; <br />
The nymph, o&#8217;erpowr&#8217;d, to art for succour flies <br />
And various shapes the eager youth surprize: <br />
A bird she seems, but plies her wings in vain, <br />
His hands the fleeting substance still detain: <br />
A branchy tree high in the air she grew; <br />
About its bark his nimble arms he threw: <br />
A tyger next she glares with flaming eyes; <br />
The frighten&#8217;d lover quits his hold, and flies: <br />
The sea-Gods he with sacred rites adores, <br />
Then a libation on the ocean pours; <br />
While the fat entrails crackle in the fire, <br />
And sheets of smoak in sweet perfume aspire; <br />
&#8216;Till Proteus rising from his oozy bed, <br />
Thus to the poor desponding lover said: <br />
No more in anxious thoughts your mind employ, <br />
For yet you shall possess the dear expected joy. <br />
You must once more th&#8217; unwary nymph surprize, <br />
As in her cooly grot she slumbring lies; <br />
Then bind her fast with unrelenting hands, <br />
And strain her tender limbs with knotted bands. <br />
Still hold her under ev&#8217;ry different shape, <br />
&#8216;Till tir&#8217;d she tries no longer to escape. <br />
Thus he: then sunk beneath the glassy flood, <br />
And broken accents flutter&#8217;d, where he stood.</p>
<p>Bright Sol had almost now his journey done, <br />
And down the steepy western convex run; <br />
When the fair Nereid left the briny wave, <br />
And, as she us&#8217;d, retreated to her cave. <br />
He scarce had bound her fast, when she arose, <br />
And into various shapes her body throws: <br />
She went to move her arms, and found &#8216;em ty&#8217;d; <br />
Then with a sigh, Some God assists ye, cry&#8217;d, <br />
And in her proper shape stood blushing by his side. <br />
About her waiste his longing arms he flung, <br />
From which embrace the great Achilles sprung.</p>
<p>The Transformation of Daedalion</p>
<p>Peleus unmix&#8217;d felicity enjoy&#8217;d <br />
(Blest in a valiant son, and virtuous bride), <br />
&#8216;Till Fortune did in blood his hands imbrue, <br />
And his own brother by curst chance he slew: <br />
Then driv&#8217;n from Thessaly, his native clime, <br />
Trachinia first gave shelter to his crime; <br />
Where peaceful Ceyx mildly fill&#8217;d the throne, <br />
And like his sire, the morning planet, shone; <br />
But now, unlike himself, bedew&#8217;d with tears, <br />
Mourning a brother lost, his brow appears. <br />
First to the town with travel spent, and care, <br />
Peleus, and his small company repair: <br />
His herds, and flocks the while at leisure feed, <br />
On the rich pasture of a neighb&#8217;ring mead. <br />
The prince before the royal presence brought, <br />
Shew&#8217;d by the suppliant olive what he sought; <br />
Then tells his name, and race, and country right, <br />
But hides th&#8217; unhappy reason of his flight. <br />
He begs the king some little town to give, <br />
Where they may safe his faithful vassals live. <br />
Ceyx reply&#8217;d: To all my bounty flows, <br />
A hospitable realm your suit has chose. <br />
Your glorious race, and far-resounding fame, <br />
And grandsire Jove, peculiar favours claim. <br />
All you can wish, I grant; entreaties spare; <br />
My kingdom (would &#8217;twere worth the sharing) share.</p>
<p>Tears stop&#8217;d his speech: astonish&#8217;d Peleus pleads <br />
To know the cause from whence his grief proceeds. <br />
The prince reply&#8217;d: There&#8217;s none of ye but deems <br />
This hawk was ever such as now it seems; <br />
Know &#8217;twas a heroe once, Daedalion nam&#8217;d, <br />
For warlike deeds, and haughty valour fam&#8217;d; <br />
Like me to that bright luminary born, <br />
Who wakes Aurora, and brings on the morn. <br />
His fierceness still remains, and love of blood, <br />
Now dread of birds, and tyrant of the wood. <br />
My make was softer, peace my greatest care; <br />
But this my brother wholly bent on war; <br />
Late nations fear&#8217;d, and routed armies fled <br />
That force, which now the tim&#8217;rous pigeons dread. <br />
A daughter he possess&#8217;d, divinely fair, <br />
And scarcely yet had seen her fifteenth year; <br />
Young Chione: a thousand rivals strove <br />
To win the maid, and teach her how to love. <br />
Phoebus, and Mercury by chance one day <br />
From Delphi, and Cyllene past this way; <br />
Together they the virgin saw: desire <br />
At once warm&#8217;d both their breasts with am&#8217;rous fire. <br />
Phoebus resolv&#8217;d to wait &#8217;till close of day; <br />
But Mercury&#8217;s hot love brook&#8217;d no delay; <br />
With his entrancing rod the maid he charms, <br />
And unresisted revels in her arms. <br />
&#8216;Twas night, and Phoebus in a beldam&#8217;s dress, <br />
To the late rifled beauty got access. <br />
Her time compleat nine circling moons had run; <br />
To either God she bore a lovely son: <br />
To Mercury Autolycus she brought, <br />
Who turn&#8217;d to thefts and tricks his subtle thought; <br />
Possess&#8217;d he was of all his father&#8217;s slight, <br />
At will made white look black, and black look white. <br />
Philammon born to Phoebus, like his sire, <br />
The Muses lov&#8217;d, and finely struck the lyre, <br />
And made his voice, and touch in harmony conspire. <br />
In vain, fond maid, you boast this double birth, <br />
The love of Gods, and royal father&#8217;s worth, <br />
And Jove among your ancestors rehearse! <br />
Could blessings such as these e&#8217;er prove a curse? <br />
To her they did, who with audacious pride, <br />
Vain of her own, Diana&#8217;s charms decry&#8217;d. <br />
Her taunts the Goddess with resentment fill; <br />
My face you like not, you shall try my skill. <br />
She said; and strait her vengeful bow she strung, <br />
And sent a shaft that pierc&#8217;d her guilty tongue: <br />
The bleeding tongue in vain its accents tries; <br />
In the red stream her soul reluctant flies. <br />
With sorrow wild I ran to her relief, <br />
And try&#8217;d to moderate my brother&#8217;s grief. <br />
He, deaf as rocks by stormy surges beat, <br />
Loudly laments, and hears me not intreat. <br />
When on the fun&#8217;ral pile he saw her laid, <br />
Thrice he to rush into the flames assay&#8217;d, <br />
Thrice with officious care by us was stay&#8217;d. <br />
Now, mad with grief, away he fled amain, <br />
Like a stung heifer that resents the pain, <br />
And bellowing wildly bounds along the plain. <br />
O&#8217;er the most rugged ways so fast he ran, <br />
He seem&#8217;d a bird already, not a man: <br />
He left us breathless all behind; and now <br />
In quest of death had gain&#8217;d Parnassus&#8217; brow: <br />
But when from thence headlong himself he threw, <br />
He fell not, but with airy pinions flew. <br />
Phoebus in pity chang&#8217;d him to a fowl, <br />
Whose crooked beak and claws the birds controul, <br />
Little of bulk, but of a warlike soul. <br />
A hawk become, the feather&#8217;d race&#8217;s foe, <br />
He tries to case his own by other&#8217;s woe.</p>
<p>A Wolf turn&#8217;d into Marble</p>
<p>While they astonish&#8217;d heard the king relate <br />
These wonders of his hapless brother&#8217;s fate; <br />
The prince&#8217;s herdsman at the court arrives, <br />
And fresh surprize to all the audience gives. <br />
O Peleus, Peleus! dreadful news I bear, <br />
He said; and trembled as he spoke for fear. <br />
The worst, affrighted Peleus bid him tell, <br />
Whilst Ceyx too grew pale with friendly zeal. <br />
Thus he began: When Sol mid-heav&#8217;n had gain&#8217;d, <br />
And half his way was past, and half remain&#8217;d, <br />
I to the level shore my cattle drove, <br />
And let them freely in the meadows rove. <br />
Some stretch&#8217;d at length admire the watry plain, <br />
Some crop&#8217;d the herb, some wanton swam the main. <br />
A temple stands of antique make hard by, <br />
Where no gilt domes, nor marble lure the eye; <br />
Unpolish&#8217;d rafters bear its lowly height, <br />
Hid by a grove, as ancient, from the sight. <br />
Here Nereus, and the Nereids they adore; <br />
I learnt it from the man who thither bore <br />
His net, to dry it on the sunny shore. <br />
Adjoyns a lake, inclos&#8217;d with willows round, <br />
Where swelling waves have overflow&#8217;d the mound, <br />
And, muddy, stagnate on the lower ground. <br />
From thence a russling noise increasing flies, <br />
Strikes the still shore; and frights us with surprize, <br />
Strait a huge wolf rush&#8217;d from the marshy wood, <br />
His jaws besmear&#8217;d with mingled foam, and blood, <br />
Tho&#8217; equally by hunger urg&#8217;d, and rage, <br />
His appetite he minds not to asswage; <br />
Nought that he meets, his rabid fury spares, <br />
But the whole herd with mad disorder tears. <br />
Some of our men who strove to drive him thence, <br />
Torn by his teeth, have dy&#8217;d in their defence. <br />
The echoing lakes, the sea, and fields, and shore, <br />
Impurpled blush with streams of reeking gore. <br />
Delay is loss, nor have we time for thought; <br />
While yet some few remain alive, we ought <br />
To seize our arms, and with confederate force <br />
Try if we so can stop his bloody course. <br />
But Peleus car&#8217;d not for his ruin&#8217;d herd; <br />
His crime he call&#8217;d to mind, and thence inferr&#8217;d, <br />
That Psamathe&#8217;s revenge this havock made, <br />
In sacrifice to murder&#8217;d Phocus&#8217; shade. <br />
The king commands his servants to their arms; <br />
Resolv&#8217;d to go; but the loud noise alarms <br />
His lovely queen, who from her chamber flew, <br />
And her half-plaited hair behind her threw: <br />
About his neck she hung with loving fears, <br />
And now with words, and now with pleading tears, <br />
Intreated that he&#8217;d send his men alone, <br />
And stay himself, to save two lives in one. <br />
Then Peleus: Your just fears, o queen, forget; <br />
Too much the offer leaves me in your debt. <br />
No arms against the monster I shall bear, <br />
But the sea nymphs appease with humble pray&#8217;r.</p>
<p>The citadel&#8217;s high turrets pierce the sky, <br />
Which home-bound vessels, glad, from far descry; <br />
This they ascend, and thence with sorrow ken <br />
The mangled heifers lye, and bleeding men; <br />
Th&#8217; inexorable ravager they view, <br />
With blood discolour&#8217;d, still the rest pursue: <br />
There Peleus pray&#8217;d submissive tow&#8217;rds the sea, <br />
And deprecates the ire of injur&#8217;d Psamathe. <br />
But deaf to all his pray&#8217;rs the nymph remain&#8217;d, <br />
&#8216;Till Thetis for her spouse the boon obtain&#8217;d. <br />
Pleas&#8217;d with the luxury, the furious beast, <br />
Unstop&#8217;d, continues still his bloody feast: <br />
While yet upon a sturdy bull he flew, <br />
Chang&#8217;d by the nymph, a marble block he grew. <br />
No longer dreadful now the wolf appears, <br />
Bury&#8217;d in stone, and vanish&#8217;d like their fears. <br />
Yet still the Fates unhappy Peleus vex&#8217;d; <br />
To the Magnesian shore he wanders next. <br />
Acastus there, who rul&#8217;d the peaceful clime, <br />
Grants his request, and expiates his crime.</p>
<p>The Story of Ceyx and Alcyone</p>
<p>These prodigies affect the pious prince, <br />
But more perplex&#8217;d with those that happen&#8217;d since, <br />
He purposes to seek the Clarian God, <br />
Avoiding Delphi, his more fam&#8217;d abode, <br />
Since Phlegyan robbers made unsafe the road. <br />
Yet could he not from her he lov&#8217;d so well, <br />
The fatal voyage, he resolv&#8217;d, conceal; <br />
But when she saw her lord prepar&#8217;d to part, <br />
A deadly cold ran shiv&#8217;ring to her heart; <br />
Her faded cheeks are chang&#8217;d to boxen hue, <br />
And in her eyes the tears are ever new. <br />
She thrice essay&#8217;d to speak; her accents hung, <br />
And falt&#8217;ring dy&#8217;d unfinish&#8217;d on her tongue, <br />
And vanish&#8217;d into sighs: with long delay <br />
Her voice return&#8217;d, and found the wonted way.</p>
<p>Tell me, my lord, she said, what fault unknown <br />
Thy once belov&#8217;d Alcyone has done? <br />
Whither, ah, whither, is thy kindness gone! <br />
Can Ceyx then sustain to leave his wife, <br />
And unconcern&#8217;d forsake the sweets of life? <br />
What can thy mind to this long journey move? <br />
Or need&#8217;st thou absence to renew thy love? <br />
Yet, if thou go&#8217;st by land, tho&#8217; grief possess <br />
My soul ev&#8217;n then, my fears will be the less. <br />
But ah! be warn&#8217;d to shun the watry way, <br />
The face is frightful of the stormy sea: <br />
For late I saw a-drift disjointed planks, <br />
And empty tombs erected on the banks. <br />
Nor let false hopes to trust betray thy mind, <br />
Because my sire in caves constrains the wind, <br />
Can with a breath their clam&#8217;rous rage appease, <br />
They fear his whistle, and forsake the seas: <br />
Not so; for once indulg&#8217;d, they sweep the main; <br />
Deaf to the call, or hearing, hear in vain; <br />
But bent on mischief bear the waves before, <br />
And not content with seas, insult the shore, <br />
When ocean, air, and Earth, at once ingage, <br />
And rooted forests fly before their rage: <br />
At once the clashing clouds to battel move, <br />
And lightnings run across the fields above: <br />
I know them well, and mark&#8217;d their rude comport, <br />
While yet a child within my father&#8217;s court: <br />
In times of tempest they command alone, <br />
And he but sits precarious on the throne: <br />
The more I know, the more my fears augment; <br />
And fears are oft prophetick of th&#8217; event. <br />
But if not fears, or reasons will prevail, <br />
If Fate has fix&#8217;d thee obstinate to sail, <br />
Go not without thy wife, but let me bear <br />
My part of danger with an equal share, <br />
And present, what I suffer only fear: <br />
Then o&#8217;er the bounding billows shall we fly, <br />
Secure to live together, or to die.</p>
<p>These reasons mov&#8217;d her warlike husband&#8217;s heart, <br />
But still he held his purpose to depart: <br />
For as he lov&#8217;d her equal to his life, <br />
He would not to the seas expose his wife; <br />
Nor could be wrought his voyage to refrain, <br />
But sought by arguments to sooth her pain: <br />
Nor these avail&#8217;d; at length he lights on one, <br />
With which so difficult a cause he won: <br />
My love, so short an absence cease to fear, <br />
For by my father&#8217;s holy flame I swear, <br />
Before two moons their orb with light adorn, <br />
If Heav&#8217;n allow me life, I will return.</p>
<p>This promise of so short a stay prevails; <br />
He soon equips the ship, supplies the sails, <br />
And gives the word to launch; she trembling views <br />
This pomp of death, and parting tears renews: <br />
Last with a kiss, she took a long farewel, <br />
Sigh&#8217;d with a sad presage, and swooning fell: <br />
While Ceyx seeks delays, the lusty crew, <br />
Rais&#8217;d on their banks, their oars in order drew <br />
To their broad breasts, the ship with fury flew.</p>
<p>The queen recover&#8217;d, rears her humid eyes, <br />
And first her husband on the poop espies, <br />
Shaking his hand at distance on the main; <br />
She took the sign, and shook her hand again. <br />
Still as the ground recedes, contracts her view <br />
With sharpen&#8217;d sight, &#8217;till she no longer knew <br />
The much-lov&#8217;d face; that comfort lost supplies <br />
With less, and with the galley feeds her eyes; <br />
The galley born from view by rising gales, <br />
She follow&#8217;d with her sight the flying sails: <br />
When ev&#8217;n the flying sails were seen no more, <br />
Forsaken of all sight she left the shore.</p>
<p>Then on her bridal bed her body throws, <br />
And sought in sleep her wearied eyes to close: <br />
Her husband&#8217;s pillow, and the widow&#8217;d part <br />
Which once he press&#8217;d, renew&#8217;d the former smart.</p>
<p>And now a breeze from shoar began to blow, <br />
The sailors ship their oars, and cease to row; <br />
Then hoist their yards a-trip, and all their sails <br />
Let fall, to court the wind, and catch the gales: <br />
By this the vessel half her course had run, <br />
Both shoars were lost to sight, when at the close <br />
Of day a stiffer gale at east arose: <br />
The sea grew white, the rouling waves from far, <br />
Like heralds, first denounce the watry war.</p>
<p>This seen, the master soon began to cry, <br />
Strike, strike the top-sail; let the main-sheet fly, <br />
And furl your sails: the winds repel the sound, <br />
And in the speaker&#8217;s mouth the speech is drown&#8217;d. <br />
Yet of their own accord, as danger taught <br />
Each in his way, officiously they wrought; <br />
Some stow their oars, or stop the leaky sides, <br />
Another bolder, yet the yard bestrides, <br />
And folds the sails; a fourth with labour laves <br />
Th&#8217; intruding seas, and waves ejects on waves.</p>
<p>In this confusion while their work they ply, <br />
The winds augment the winter of the sky, <br />
And wage intestine wars; the suff&#8217;ring seas <br />
Are toss&#8217;d, and mingled, as their tyrants please. <br />
The master would command, but in despair <br />
Of safety, stands amaz&#8217;d with stupid care, <br />
Nor what to bid, or what forbid he knows, <br />
Th&#8217; ungovern&#8217;d tempest to such fury grows: <br />
Vain is his force, and vainer is his skill; <br />
With such a concourse comes the flood of ill; <br />
The cries of men are mix&#8217;d with rattling shrowds; <br />
Seas dash on seas, and clouds encounter clouds: <br />
At once from east to west, from pole to pole, <br />
The forky lightnings flash, the roaring thunders roul.</p>
<p>Now waves on waves ascending scale the skies, <br />
And in the fires above the water fries: <br />
When yellow sands are sifted from below, <br />
The glittering billows give a golden show: <br />
And when the fouler bottom spews the black <br />
The Stygian dye the tainted waters take: <br />
Then frothy white appear the flatted seas, <br />
And change their colour, changing their disease, <br />
Like various fits the Trachin vessel finds, <br />
And now sublime, she rides upon the winds; <br />
As from a lofty summit looks from high, <br />
And from the clouds beholds the nether sky; <br />
Now from the depth of Hell they lift their sight, <br />
And at a distance see superior light; <br />
The lashing billows make a loud report, <br />
And beat her sides, as batt&#8217;ring rams a fort: <br />
Or as a lion bounding in his way, <br />
With force augmented, bears against his prey, <br />
Sidelong to seize; or unapal&#8217;d with fear, <br />
Springs on the toils, and rushes on the spear: <br />
So seas impell&#8217;d by winds, with added pow&#8217;r <br />
Assault the sides, and o&#8217;er the hatches tow&#8217;r.</p>
<p>The planks (their pitchy cov&#8217;ring wash&#8217;d away) <br />
Now yield; and now a yawning breach display: <br />
The roaring waters with a hostile tide <br />
Rush through the ruins of her gaping side. <br />
Mean-time in sheets of rain the sky descends, <br />
And ocean swell&#8217;d with waters upwards tends; <br />
One rising, falling one, the Heav&#8217;ns and sea <br />
Meet at their confines, in the middle way: <br />
The sails are drunk with show&#8217;rs, and drop with rain, <br />
Sweet waters mingle with the briny main. <br />
No star appears to lend his friendly light; <br />
Darkness, and tempest make a double night; <br />
But flashing fires disclose the deep by turns, <br />
And while the lightnings blaze, the water burns.</p>
<p>Now all the waves their scatter&#8217;d force unite, <br />
And as a soldier foremost in the fight, <br />
Makes way for others, and an host alone <br />
Still presses on, and urging gains the town; <br />
So while th&#8217; invading billows come a-breast, <br />
The hero tenth advanc&#8217;d before the rest, <br />
Sweeps all before him with impetuous sway, <br />
And from the walls descends upon the prey; <br />
Part following enter, part remain without, <br />
With envy hear their fellows&#8217; conqu&#8217;ring shout, <br />
And mount on others&#8217; backs, in hopes to share <br />
The city, thus become the seat of war.</p>
<p>An universal cry resounds aloud, <br />
The sailors run in heaps, a helpless crowd; <br />
Art fails, and courage falls, no succour near; <br />
As many waves, as many deaths appear. <br />
One weeps, and yet despairs of late relief; <br />
One cannot weep, his fears congeal his grief, <br />
But stupid, with dry eyes expects his fate: <br />
One with loud shrieks laments his lost estate, <br />
And calls those happy whom their fun&#8217;rals wait. <br />
This wretch with pray&#8217;rs and vows the Gods implores, <br />
And ev&#8217;n the skies he cannot see, adores. <br />
That other on his friends his thoughts bestows, <br />
His careful father, and his faithful spouse. <br />
The covetous worldling in his anxious mind, <br />
Thinks only on the wealth he left behind.</p>
<p>All Ceyx his Alcyone employs, <br />
For her he grieves, yet in her absence joys: <br />
His wife he wishes, and would still be near, <br />
Not her with him, but wishes him with her: <br />
Now with last looks he seeks his native shoar, <br />
Which Fate has destin&#8217;d him to see no more; <br />
He sought, but in the dark tempestuous night <br />
He knew not whither to direct his sight. <br />
So whirl the seas, such darkness blinds the sky, <br />
That the black night receives a deeper dye.</p>
<p>The giddy ship ran round; the tempest tore <br />
Her mast, and over-board the rudder bore. <br />
One billow mounts, and with a scornful brow, <br />
Proud of her conquest gain&#8217;d, insults the waves below; <br />
Nor lighter falls, than if some giant tore <br />
Pindus and Athos with the freight they bore, <br />
And toss&#8217;d on seas; press&#8217;d with the pond&#8217;rous blow, <br />
Down sinks the ship within th&#8217; abyss below: <br />
Down with the vessel sink into the main <br />
The many, never more to rise again. <br />
Some few on scatter&#8217;d planks, with fruitless care, <br />
Lay hold, and swim; but while they swim, despair.</p>
<p>Ev&#8217;n he who late a scepter did command, <br />
Now grasps a floating fragment in his hand; <br />
And while he struggles on the stormy main, <br />
Invokes his father, and his wife&#8217;s, in vain. <br />
But yet his consort is his greatest care, <br />
Alcyone he names amidst his pray&#8217;r; <br />
Names as a charm against the waves and wind; <br />
Most in his mouth, and ever in his mind. <br />
Tir&#8217;d with his toil, all hopes of safety past, <br />
From pray&#8217;rs to wishes he descends at last; <br />
That his dead body, wafted to the sands, <br />
Might have its burial from her friendly hands, <br />
As oft as he can catch a gulp of air, <br />
And peep above the seas, he names the fair; <br />
And ev&#8217;n when plung&#8217;d beneath, on her he raves, <br />
Murm&#8217;ring Alcyone below the waves: <br />
At last a falling billow stops his breath, <br />
Breaks o&#8217;er his head, and whelms him underneath. <br />
That night, his heav&#8217;nly form obscur&#8217;d with tears, <br />
And since he was forbid to leave the skies, <br />
He muffled with a cloud his mournful eyes.</p>
<p>Mean-time Alcyone (his fate unknown) <br />
Computes how many nights he had been gone. <br />
Observes the waining moon with hourly view, <br />
Numbers her age, and wishes for a new; <br />
Against the promis&#8217;d time provides with care, <br />
And hastens in the woof the robes he was to wear: <br />
And for her self employs another loom, <br />
New-dress&#8217;d to meet her lord returning home, <br />
Flatt&#8217;ring her heart with joys, that never were to come: <br />
She fum&#8217;d the temples with an od&#8217;rous flame, <br />
And oft before the sacred altars came, <br />
To pray for him, who was an empty name. <br />
All Pow&#8217;rs implor&#8217;d, but far above the rest <br />
To Juno she her pious vows address&#8217;d, <br />
Her much-lov&#8217;d lord from perils to protect, <br />
And safe o&#8217;er seas his voyage to direct: <br />
Then pray&#8217;d, that she might still possess his heart, <br />
And no pretending rival share a part; <br />
This last petition heard of all her pray&#8217;r, <br />
The rest, dispers&#8217;d by winds, were lost in air.</p>
<p>But she, the Goddess of the nuptial bed, <br />
Tir&#8217;d with her vain devotions for the dead, <br />
Resolv&#8217;d the tainted hand should be repell&#8217;d, <br />
Which incense offer&#8217;d, and her altar held: <br />
Then Iris thus bespoke: Thou faithful maid, <br />
By whom thy queen&#8217;s commands are well convey&#8217;d, <br />
Haste to the house of sleep, and bid the God <br />
Who rules the night by visions with a nod, <br />
Prepare a dream, in figure, and in form <br />
Resembling him, who perish&#8217;d in the storm; <br />
This form before Alcyone present, <br />
To make her certain of the sad event.</p>
<p>Indu&#8217;d with robes of various hue she flies, <br />
And flying draws an arch (a segment of the skies): <br />
Then leaves her bending bow, and from the steep <br />
Descends, to search the silent house of sleep.</p>
<p>The House of Sleep</p>
<p>Near the Cymmerians, in his dark abode, <br />
Deep in a cavern, dwells the drowzy God; <br />
Whose gloomy mansion nor the rising sun, <br />
Nor setting, visits, nor the lightsome noon; <br />
But lazy vapours round the region fly, <br />
Perpetual twilight, and a doubtful sky: <br />
No crowing cock does there his wings display, <br />
Nor with his horny bill provoke the day; <br />
Nor watchful dogs, nor the more wakeful geese, <br />
Disturb with nightly noise the sacred peace; <br />
Nor beast of Nature, nor the tame are nigh, <br />
Nor trees with tempests rock&#8217;d, nor human cry; <br />
But safe repose without an air of breath <br />
Dwells here, and a dumb quiet next to death.</p>
<p>An arm of Lethe, with a gentle flow <br />
Arising upwards from the rock below, <br />
The palace moats, and o&#8217;er the pebbles creeps, <br />
And with soft murmurs calls the coming sleeps. <br />
Around its entry nodding poppies grow, <br />
And all cool simples that sweet rest bestow; <br />
Night from the plants their sleepy virtue drains, <br />
And passing, sheds it on the silent plains: <br />
No door there was th&#8217; unguarded house to keep, <br />
On creaking hinges turn&#8217;d, to break his sleep.</p>
<p>But in the gloomy court was rais&#8217;d a bed, <br />
Stuff&#8217;d with black plumes, and on an ebon-sted: <br />
Black was the cov&#8217;ring too, where lay the God, <br />
And slept supine, his limbs display&#8217;d abroad: <br />
About his head fantastick visions fly, <br />
Which various images of things supply, <br />
And mock their forms; the leaves on trees not more, <br />
Nor bearded ears in fields, nor sands upon the shore.</p>
<p>The virgin ent&#8217;ring bright, indulg&#8217;d the day <br />
To the brown cave, and brush&#8217;d the dreams away: <br />
The God disturb&#8217;d with this new glare of light, <br />
Cast sudden on his face, unseal&#8217;d his sight, <br />
And rais&#8217;d his tardy head, which sunk again, <br />
And sinking, on his bosom knock&#8217;d his chin; <br />
At length shook off himself, and ask&#8217;d the dame, <br />
(And asking yawn&#8217;d) for what intent she came.</p>
<p>To whom the Goddess thus: O sacred rest, <br />
Sweet pleasing sleep, of all the Pow&#8217;rs the best! <br />
O peace of mind, repairer of decay, <br />
Whose balms renew the limbs to labours of the day, <br />
Care shuns thy soft approach, and sullen flies away! <br />
Adorn a dream, expressing human form, <br />
The shape of him who suffer&#8217;d in the storm, <br />
And send it flitting to the Trachin court, <br />
The wreck of wretched Ceyx to report: <br />
Before his queen bid the pale spectre stand, <br />
Who begs a vain relief at Juno&#8217;s hand. <br />
She said, and scarce awake her eyes could keep, <br />
Unable to support the fumes of sleep; <br />
But fled, returning by the way she went, <br />
And swerv&#8217;d along her bow with swift ascent.</p>
<p>The God, uneasy &#8217;till he slept again, <br />
Resolv&#8217;d at once to rid himself of pain; <br />
And, tho&#8217; against his custom, call&#8217;d aloud, <br />
Exciting Morpheus from the sleepy crowd: <br />
Morpheus, of all his numerous train, express&#8217;d <br />
The shape of man, and imitated best; <br />
The walk, the words, the gesture could supply, <br />
The habit mimick, and the mein bely; <br />
Plays well, but all his action is confin&#8217;d, <br />
Extending not beyond our human kind. <br />
Another, birds, and beasts, and dragons apes, <br />
And dreadful images, and monster shapes: <br />
This demon, Icelos, in Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s high hall <br />
The Gods have nam&#8217;d; but men Phobetor call. <br />
A third is Phantasus, whose actions roul <br />
On meaner thoughts, and things devoid of soul; <br />
Earth, fruits, and flow&#8217;rs he represents in dreams, <br />
And solid rocks unmov&#8217;d, and running streams. <br />
These three to kings, and chiefs their scenes display, <br />
The rest before th&#8217; ignoble commons play. <br />
Of these the chosen Morpheus is dispatch&#8217;d; <br />
Which done, the lazy monarch, over-watch&#8217;d, <br />
Down from his propping elbow drops his head, <br />
Dissolv&#8217;d in sleep, and shrinks within his bed.</p>
<p>Darkling the demon glides, for flight prepar&#8217;d, <br />
So soft, that scarce his fanning wings are heard. <br />
To Trachin, swift as thought, the flitting shade, <br />
Thro&#8217; air his momentary journey made: <br />
Then lays aside the steerage of his wings, <br />
Forsakes his proper form, assumes the king&#8217;s; <br />
And pale, as death, despoil&#8217;d of his array, <br />
Into the queen&#8217;s apartment takes his way, <br />
And stands before the bed at dawn of day: <br />
Unmov&#8217;d his eyes, and wet his beard appears; <br />
And shedding vain, but seeming real tears; <br />
The briny waters dropping from his hairs. <br />
Then staring on her with a ghastly look, <br />
And hollow voice, he thus the queen bespoke.</p>
<p>Know&#8217;st thou not me? Not yet, unhappy wife? <br />
Or are my features perish&#8217;d with my life? <br />
Look once again, and for thy husband lost, <br />
Lo all that&#8217;s left of him, thy husband&#8217;s ghost! <br />
Thy vows for my return were all in vain, <br />
The stormy south o&#8217;ertook us in the main, <br />
And never shalt thou see thy living lord again. <br />
Bear witness, Heav&#8217;n, I call&#8217;d on thee in death, <br />
And while I call&#8217;d, a billow stop&#8217;d my breath. <br />
Think not, that flying fame reports my fate; <br />
I present, I appear, and my own wreck relate. <br />
Rise, wretched widow, rise; nor undeplor&#8217;d <br />
Permit my soul to pass the Stygian ford; <br />
But rise, prepar&#8217;d in black, to mourn thy perish&#8217;d lord.</p>
<p>Thus said the player-God; and adding art <br />
Of voice and gesture, so perform&#8217;d his part, <br />
She thought (so like her love the shade appears) <br />
That Ceyx spake the words, and Ceyx shed the tears; <br />
She groan&#8217;d, her inward soul with grief opprest, <br />
She sigh&#8217;d, she wept, and sleeping beat her breast; <br />
Then stretch&#8217;d her arms t&#8217; embrace his body bare; <br />
Her clasping arms inclose but empty air: <br />
At this, not yet awake, she cry&#8217;d, O stay; <br />
One is our fate, and common is our way!</p>
<p>So dreadful was the dream, so loud she spoke, <br />
That starting sudden up, the slumber broke: <br />
Then cast her eyes around, in hope to view <br />
Her vanish&#8217;d lord, and find the vision true: <br />
For now the maids, who waited her commands, <br />
Ran in with lighted tapers in their hands. <br />
Tir&#8217;d with the search, not finding what she seeks, <br />
With cruel blows she pounds her blubber&#8217;d cheeks; <br />
Then from her beaten breast the linnen tare, <br />
And cut the golden caul that bound her hair. <br />
Her nurse demands the cause; with louder cries <br />
She prosecutes her griefs, and thus replies.</p>
<p>No more Alcyone; she suffer&#8217;d death <br />
With her lov&#8217;d lord, when Ceyx lost his breath: <br />
No flatt&#8217;ry, no false comfort, give me none, <br />
My shipwreck&#8217;d Ceyx is for ever gone: <br />
I saw, I saw him manifest in view, <br />
His voice, his figure, and his gestures knew: <br />
His lustre lost, and ev&#8217;ry living grace, <br />
Yet I retain&#8217;d the features of his face; <br />
Tho&#8217; with pale cheeks, wet beard, and dropping hair, <br />
None but my Ceyx could appear so fair: <br />
I would have strain&#8217;d him with a strict embrace, <br />
But thro&#8217; my arms he slipt, and vanish&#8217;d from the place: <br />
There, ev&#8217;n just there he stood; and as she spoke, <br />
Where last the spectre was she cast her look: <br />
Fain would she hope, and gaz&#8217;d upon the ground, <br />
If any printed footsteps might be found.</p>
<p>Then sigh&#8217;d, and said: This I too well foreknew, <br />
And my prophetick fears presag&#8217;d too true: <br />
&#8216;Twas what I begg&#8217;d, when with a bleeding heart <br />
I took my leave, and suffer&#8217;d thee to part; <br />
Or I to go along, or thou to stay, <br />
Never, ah never to divide our way! <br />
Happier for me, that all our hours assign&#8217;d <br />
Together we had liv&#8217;d; ev&#8217;n not in death disjoin&#8217;d! <br />
So had my Ceyx still been living here, <br />
Or with my Ceyx I had perish&#8217;d there: <br />
Now I die absent, in the vast profound; <br />
And me, without my self, the seas have drown&#8217;d. <br />
The storms were not so cruel: should I strive <br />
To lengthen life, and such a grief survive; <br />
But neither will I strive, nor wretched thee <br />
In death forsake, but keep thee company. <br />
If not one common sepulchre contains <br />
Our bodies, or one urn our last remains, <br />
Yet Ceyx and Alcyone shall join, <br />
Their names remember&#8217;d in one common line.</p>
<p>No farther voice her mighty grief affords, <br />
For sighs come rushing in betwixt her words, <br />
And stop&#8217;d her tongue; but what her tongue deny&#8217;d, <br />
Soft tears, and groans, and dumb complaints supply&#8217;d.</p>
<p>&#8216;Twas morning; to the port she takes her way, <br />
And stands upon the margin of the sea: <br />
That place, that very spot of ground she sought, <br />
Or thither by her destiny was brought, <br />
Where last he stood: and while she sadly said, <br />
&#8216;Twas here he left me, lingring here delay&#8217;d <br />
His parting kiss, and there his anchors weigh&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Thus speaking, while her thoughts past actions trace, <br />
And call to mind, admonish&#8217;d by the place, <br />
Sharp at her utmost ken she cast her eyes, <br />
And somewhat floating from afar descries: <br />
It seems a corps a-drift to distant sight, <br />
But at a distance who could judge aright? <br />
It wafted nearer yet, and then she knew, <br />
That what before she but surmis&#8217;d, was true: <br />
A corps it was, but whose it was, unknown, <br />
Yet mov&#8217;d, howe&#8217;er, she made the cause her own. <br />
Took the bad omen of a shipwreck&#8217;d man, <br />
As for a stranger wept, and thus began.</p>
<p>Poor wretch, on stormy seas to lose thy life, <br />
Unhappy thou, but more thy widow&#8217;d wife; <br />
At this she paus&#8217;d: for now the flowing tide <br />
Had brought the body nearer to the side: <br />
The more she looks, the more her fears increase, <br />
At nearer sight; and she&#8217;s her self the less: <br />
Now driv&#8217;n ashore, and at her feet it lies, <br />
She knows too much in knowing whom she sees: <br />
Her husband&#8217;s corps; at this she loudly shrieks, <br />
&#8216;Tis he, &#8217;tis he, she cries, and tears her cheeks, <br />
Her hair, and vest; and stooping to the sands, <br />
About his neck she cast her trembling hands.</p>
<p>And is it thus, o dearer than my life, <br />
Thus, thus return&#8217;st thou to thy longing wife! <br />
She said, and to the neighbouring mole she strode, <br />
(Rais&#8217;d there to break th&#8217; incursions of the flood).</p>
<p>Headlong from hence to plunge her self she springs, <br />
But shoots along, supported on her wings; <br />
A bird new-made, about the banks she plies, <br />
Not far from shore, and short excursions tries; <br />
Nor seeks in air her humble flight to raise, <br />
Content to skim the surface of the seas: <br />
Her bill tho&#8217; slender, sends a creaking noise, <br />
And imitates a lamentable voice. <br />
Now lighting where the bloodless body lies, <br />
She with a fun&#8217;ral note renews her cries: <br />
At all her stretch, her little wings she spread, <br />
And with her feather&#8217;d arms embrac&#8217;d the dead: <br />
Then flick&#8217;ring to his palid lips, she strove <br />
To print a kiss, the last essay of love. <br />
Whether the vital touch reviv&#8217;d the dead, <br />
Or that the moving waters rais&#8217;d his head <br />
To meet the kiss, the vulgar doubt alone; <br />
For sure a present miracle was shown. <br />
The Gods their shapes to winter-birds translate, <br />
But both obnoxious to their former fate. <br />
Their conjugal affection still is ty&#8217;d, <br />
And still the mournful race is multiply&#8217;d: <br />
They bill, they tread; Alcyone compress&#8217;d, <br />
Sev&#8217;n days sits brooding on her floating nest: <br />
A wintry queen: her sire at length is kind, <br />
Calms ev&#8217;ry storm, and hushes ev&#8217;ry wind; <br />
Prepares his empire for his daughter&#8217;s ease, <br />
And for his hatching nephews smooths the seas.</p>
<p>Aesacus transform&#8217;d into a Cormorant</p>
<p>These some old man sees wanton in the air, <br />
And praises the unhappy constant pair. <br />
Then to his friend the long-neck&#8217;d corm&#8217;rant shows, <br />
The former tale reviving others&#8217; woes: <br />
That sable bird, he cries, which cuts the flood <br />
With slender legs, was once of royal blood; <br />
His ancestors from mighty Tros proceed, <br />
The brave Laomedon, and Ganymede <br />
(Whose beauty tempted Jove to steal the boy), <br />
And Priam, hapless prince! who fell with Troy: <br />
Himself was Hector&#8217;s brother, and (had Fate <br />
But giv&#8217;n this hopeful youth a longer date) <br />
Perhaps had rival&#8217;d warlike Hector&#8217;s worth, <br />
Tho&#8217; on the mother&#8217;s side of meaner birth; <br />
Fair Alyxothoe, a country maid, <br />
Bare Aesacus by stealth in Ida&#8217;s shade. <br />
He fled the noisy town, and pompous court, <br />
Lov&#8217;d the lone hills, and simple rural sport. <br />
And seldom to the city would resort. <br />
Yet he no rustick clownishness profest, <br />
Nor was soft love a stranger to his breast: <br />
The youth had long the nymph Hesperie woo&#8217;d, <br />
Oft thro&#8217; the thicket, or the mead pursu&#8217;d: <br />
Her haply on her father&#8217;s bank he spy&#8217;d, <br />
While fearless she her silver tresses dry&#8217;d; <br />
Away she fled: not stags with half such speed, <br />
Before the prowling wolf, scud o&#8217;er the mead; <br />
Not ducks, when they the safer flood forsake, <br />
Pursu&#8217;d by hawks, so swift regain the lake. <br />
As fast he follow&#8217;d in the hot career; <br />
Desire the lover wing&#8217;d, the virgin fear. <br />
A snake unseen now pierc&#8217;d her heedless foot; <br />
Quick thro&#8217; the veins the venom&#8217;d juices shoot: <br />
She fell, and &#8216;scap&#8217;d by death his fierce pursuit; <br />
Her lifeless body, frighted, he embrac&#8217;d, <br />
And cry&#8217;d, Not this I dreaded, but thy haste: <br />
O had my love been less, or less thy fear! <br />
The victory, thus bought, is far too dear. <br />
Accursed snake! yet I more curs&#8217;d than he! <br />
He gave the wound; the cause was given by me. <br />
Yet none shall say, that unreveng&#8217;d you dy&#8217;d. <br />
He spoke; then climb&#8217;d a cliff&#8217;s o&#8217;er-hanging side, <br />
And, resolute, leap&#8217;d on the foaming tide. <br />
Tethys receiv&#8217;d him gently on the wave; <br />
The death he sought deny&#8217;d, and feathers gave. <br />
Debarr&#8217;d the surest remedy of grief, <br />
And forc&#8217;d to live, he curst th&#8217; unask&#8217;d relief. <br />
Then on his airy pinions upward flies, <br />
And at a second fall successless tries; <br />
The downy plume a quick descent denies. <br />
Enrag&#8217;d, he often dives beneath the wave, <br />
And there in vain expects to find a grave. <br />
His ceaseless sorrow for th&#8217; unhappy maid, <br />
Meager&#8217;d his look, and on his spirits prey&#8217;d. <br />
Still near the sounding deep he lives; his name <br />
From frequent diving and emerging came. </p>
