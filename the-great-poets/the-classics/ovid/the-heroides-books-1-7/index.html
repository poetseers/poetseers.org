				<p>I: Penelope to Ulysses
</p>
<p>Your Penelope sends you this, Ulysses, the so-long-delayed.</p>
<p>Don?t reply to me however: come yourself.</p>
<p>Troy lies in ruins, an enemy, indeed, to the girls of Greece -</p>
<p>Priam, and all of Troy, were scarcely worth this!</p>
<p>O I wish, at that time when he sought Sparta with his fleet,</p>
<p>Paris, the adulterer, had been whelmed beneath angry seas!</p>
<p>I would not have lain here, cold in an empty bed,</p>
<p>nor be left behind, to complain, at suffering long days,</p>
<p>nor my hand, bereft, exhaust me, working all night long</p>
<p>to cause deception, with my doubtful web.</p>
<p>When have I not feared dangers worse than all realities?</p>
<p>Love is a thing full of anxious fears.</p>
<p>I imagined the Trojans? violent attacks on you:</p>
<p>often I grew pale at Hector?s name:</p>
<p>if someone told of Antilochus defeated by Hector,</p>
<p>Antilochus was the reason for my fears,</p>
<p>if of Patroclus, dying in Achilles?s armour,</p>
<p>I wept that tricks might fail of success.</p>
<p>Tlepolemus warmed the spear of Sarpedon with blood,</p>
<p>Tlepolemus?s death is then a new cause of anxiety to me.</p>
<p>In short, whoever of the Greek camp was killed,</p>
<p>the heart of a lover was chilled like ice.</p>
<p>But the god, who favours pure love, truly gave protection:</p>
<p>Troy is turned to ashes: by a hero who?s unharmed.</p>
<p>Our generals return to Greece, the altars smoke,</p>
<p>barbarous gifts are set before the country?s gods.</p>
<p>Wives give thanks, for the gift of living husbands:</p>
<p>who sing in turn of their Troy conquered by fate:</p>
<p>upright old men and trembling girls marvel,</p>
<p>the wife hangs on her husband?s words as he speaks.</p>
<p>And one seated at table describes the fierce battle</p>
<p>and draws all of Troy in a little wine:</p>
<p>?Here was Simois, here Sigean ground,</p>
<p>here stood aged Priam?s towering palace:</p>
<p>here Achilles camped, here Ulysses,</p>
<p>here mangled Hector scared the galloping horses.?</p>
<p>Indeed Nestor related it all to your son Telemachus,</p>
<p>sent to enquire about you, then he to me.</p>
<p>And he told of Rhesus and Dolon dead by your sword,</p>
<p>so that one was betrayed by sleep, the other by guile.</p>
<p>It was brave, oh you, who are more and more forgetful of your own,</p>
<p>to enter the Thracian camp, with night?s deception,</p>
<p>and kill so many men, with the help of one!</p>
<p>Then you were truly cautious, and thinking first of me!</p>
<p>My heart shook all the time, with fear, while my dear hero</p>
<p>was depicted, riding through the army on Ismarus?s horses.</p>
<p>But what benefit to me if Troy?s cast down, by your arms,</p>
<p>and the walls that it possessed are razed to the ground,</p>
<p>if I wait here, as I waited while Troy still stood,</p>
<p>and my husband away, with no end in sight?</p>
<p>Destroyed for others, Troy remains, for me alone,</p>
<p>where the victor lives to plough with captive oxen:</p>
<p>there are fields now, where Troy once was, and the earth,</p>
<p>beneath the scythe, crops densely, rich with Phrygian blood:</p>
<p>half-buried bones of heroes are struck by the curving plough,</p>
<p>and grass conceals the ruined houses.</p>
<p>The victor is absent, and I am not allowed to know,</p>
<p>the reason for his delay, or in what land he cruelly hides.</p>
<p>Whoever turns his wandering vessel towards this shore</p>
<p>departs weary of being questioned by me, about you:</p>
<p>and what he?ll deliver to you, if he sees you anywhere,</p>
<p>will be letters surrendered to him, written by my hand.</p>
<p>I sent to Pylos, to the Nelean fields of ancient Nestor:</p>
<p>doubtful rumours returned from Pylos:</p>
<p>and I sent to Sparta: no known truth from Sparta either.</p>
<p>What land do you live in, or with whom do you delay so long?</p>
<p>It would be better if Apollo?s walls still stood:</p>
<p>alas I?m angered myself by my thoughtless prayers!</p>
<p>I might have known where you were fighting, and only fear the war,</p>
<p>and my complaints would then have be joined with many others.</p>
<p>I don?t know what to fear: I fear everything, insanely,</p>
<p>and my anxieties are open to wide speculation.</p>
<p>Whether the sea contains the danger, or the land,</p>
<p>such long delays equally cause me to suspect.</p>
<p>While I foolishly fear it, that is your wilfulness,</p>
<p>you could be captive now to a foreign love.</p>
<p>And perhaps you tell her, that your wife?s an innocent,</p>
<p>considered to be almost like raw wool.</p>
<p>Let me be deceived, and let this charge vanish in thin air</p>
<p>and let your returning sails not be wilfully absent.</p>
<p>My father Iscarius forces me to leave my empty bed,</p>
<p>and rebukes me for my continual, endless waiting.</p>
<p>It?s all right for him to rebuke me continually! I?m yours, I should</p>
<p>be spoken of as yours: I?ll be Penelope, wife to Ulysses, always.</p>
<p>Yet he weakens knowing my piety, and my chaste prayers,</p>
<p>and he moderates the force of it himself.</p>
<p>An insistent crowd of suitors comes to ruin us,</p>
<p>from Dulichium and Samos, and those who hold high Zacynthus,</p>
<p>and they rule in your palace, without restraint:</p>
<p>they tear your possessions to pieces, and my heart.</p>
<p>What should I say of how you, shamefully absent, nourish</p>
<p>Pisander, Polybus, cruel Medon, the greedy hands of Eurymachus, and Antinous, and others: all of them, with your blood?</p>
<p>Irus and Melanthius driving in the flocks to be slaughtered</p>
<p>add the final insult to your ruin.</p>
<p>The unwarlike ones are three in number: a wife with no strength,</p>
<p>old Laertes, and Telemachus your son.</p>
<p>He, recently, was almost taken away from me by trickery,</p>
<p>when he prepared to go to Pylos, against their will.</p>
<p>I pray the gods decree that, in the natural order of things,</p>
<p>he will close my eyes in death, and yours!</p>
<p>The faithful guardian of the filthy sty makes up another three,</p>
<p>along with the herdsman, and your very ancient nurse:</p>
<p>but Laertes, has no power to hold his own among enemies,</p>
<p>he whose weapons are useless to him.</p>
<p>Telemachus, if only he lives, will become stronger with age:</p>
<p>now he ought to be protected with his father?s help.</p>
<p>I have no strength to drive these enemies from the house:</p>
<p>you must come quickly, to your harbour and refuge!</p>
<p>You?ve a son, and I pray he?ll be one who, in his tender years,</p>
<p>will be educated in his father?s arts.</p>
<p>Consider Laertes: who keeps death back to the very last day,</p>
<p>so that you might close his eyes.</p>
<p>You?ll find that I, in truth, a girl when you went away,</p>
<p>though you soon return, have become an aged woman.</p>
<p>II: Phyllis to Demophoon
</p>
<p>Phyllis, your Thracian friend, complains to you, Demophoon,</p>
<p>for being absent beyond your promised time.</p>
<p>When the moon?s horns had touched once more, at the full,</p>
<p>you agreed to anchor by our shores.</p>
<p>Four times the moon has hidden, four times waxed to the full,</p>
<p>without the Thracian sea bringing Athenian ships.</p>
<p>If you measure hours closely, as lovers measure,</p>
<p>my complaint does not come before due time.</p>
<p>Hope too was long drawn out. We?re slow to believe what wounds</p>
<p>us, when we do: now you seem guilty, reluctantly, to your lover.</p>
<p>I often deceived myself, for you, often I imagined</p>
<p>storms from the south brought back your white sails.</p>
<p>I cursed Theseus, because he did not wish to let you go:</p>
<p>or perhaps could not remember your course.</p>
<p>Now and then I feared lest, heading for Hebrus?s shallows,</p>
<p>the ship was wrecked, sunk in the white waves.</p>
<p>Often I have begged, impiously, of the gods that you be well,</p>
<p>have wished for it in prayer at incense-burning altars:</p>
<p>often, seeing favourable winds from sea and sky,</p>
<p>I said to myself: ?If he?s well, he will come,?</p>
<p>Lastly, love supposed you faithful, whatever prevented haste,</p>
<p>and I was imaginative as to the reasons.</p>
<p>But you are indifferent, in your absence! No oaths to the gods</p>
<p>bring you back, nor do you return moved by my love.</p>
<p>Demophoon, you gave words, and sails, to the wind:</p>
<p>I long for the sails? return, lacking faith in the words.</p>
<p>Tell me what I have done, except to love unwisely?</p>
<p>Could I have deserved you, through some crime of mine?</p>
<p>There is only one sin in me, that I pledged myself to you,</p>
<p>wicked man, but it has the weight and likeness of justice.</p>
<p>Where now is the pact of loyalty, hand linked to hand,</p>
<p>and how were so many oaths in one lying mouth?</p>
<p>Where is that Hymen now, who, through long years of friendship,</p>
<p>was sponsor and guarantor to me of marriage?</p>
<p>You swore to me by the sea, all stirred by winds and waves,</p>
<p>over which you surely travel, over which you were to go,</p>
<p>you swore by Neptune, your grandfather, unless that too is a lie,</p>
<p>who calms the waters roused by the winds,</p>
<p>by Venus, and those weapons, made so much so to me,</p>
<p>one weapon the bow, the other the torch,</p>
<p>and by Juno, whose kindness presides over the marriage bed,</p>
<p>and by the mystic rites of the torch-bearing goddess:</p>
<p>if each of these many injured gods took vengeance with their powers,</p>
<p>your life alone would not be enough, in punishment!</p>
<p>Ah, like a madwoman, I even had your damaged fleet rebuilt,</p>
<p>so that there was a sound ship ready for your desertion:</p>
<p>I gave you oars so that you might abandon me in flight.</p>
<p>Alas! I suffer wounds from weapons I created!</p>
<p>I believed the flattering words, of which you had a store:</p>
<p>I believed in your breeding and your titles:</p>
<p>I believed your tears. Or might even they be taught to deceive?</p>
<p>Might they have arts as well, to flow when commanded?</p>
<p>I believed them, too. Where now those many pledges of ours?</p>
<p>Any one of them was enough to imprison me.</p>
<p>I am not disturbed that I helped you with harbour and shelter:</p>
<p>but that should have been the end of my kindnesses!</p>
<p>I regret that friendship was shamefully crowned</p>
<p>by the nuptial bed, and body was entwined with body.</p>
<p>I would rather the night, before that night, had been my last,</p>
<p>while Phyllis could still die virtuously.</p>
<p>I hoped for better things, and thought I deserved them:</p>
<p>whatever hope comes from kindness, is just.</p>
<p>I cannot believe that to cheat a girl is anything</p>
<p>to boast of: my innocence deserved friendship.</p>
<p>The lover and the woman were deceived by your words:</p>
<p>may the gods let this be the one thing you are known for!</p>
<p>And let your statue be set up in the midst of the city,</p>
<p>among the sons of Aegeus: Theseus, your great father,</p>
<p>his honours before him: Sciron with his bed, grim Procrustes,</p>
<p>and Sinis, and the Minotaur, man and bull joined together,</p>
<p>and Thebes conquered in war, and the Centaurs routed,</p>
<p>and the blind, shattered kingdom of Pluto, the dark god:</p>
<p>your statue inscribed with its title after theirs:</p>
<p>?Here?s he who stole love from a stranger by a trick.?</p>
<p>Of all your father?s many deeds and affairs</p>
<p>only the abandoning of Ariadne sticks in your mind.</p>
<p>The thing in him needing to be excused, is the one thing you admire:</p>
<p>your father?s heir, deceiver: you act out his sin.</p>
<p>She ? I don?t begrudge it ?is blessed with a better husband</p>
<p>and rides high above Bacchus?s team of harnessed tigers.</p>
<p>But the Thracian men I despised flee from marriage with me,</p>
<p>because I allowed a man strange to me to be preferred.</p>
<p>And some said: ?Let her go to learned Athens:</p>
<p>there will be someone else to rule armed Thrace.</p>
<p>Outcomes justify actions.? I hope that anyone who thinks</p>
<p>what I did is wrong because of its result, also lacks success.</p>
<p>But if our water does foam under your oar,</p>
<p>they?ll say now I look out for myself, then my people.</p>
<p>But I have not looked to myself, and you will not touch</p>
<p>my shore, or bathe your limbs in Thracian water.</p>
<p>My eyes cling still to the sight of your going,</p>
<p>when your departing fleet sat in harbour.</p>
<p>You dared to embrace me, and, clinging to my neck,</p>
<p>poured out a lover?s slow kisses, through long moments,</p>
<p>and, as your tears mingled with my tears,</p>
<p>you complained at the favourable wind in your sails,</p>
<p>shouting to me, as you left, at the top of your voice:</p>
<p>?Phyllis, make sure you wait for your Demophoon!?</p>
<p>Should I wait, for you who are absent and never wish to see me?</p>
<p>Should I wait for the sails that are denied my seas?</p>
<p>And still I wait. Only return, though late, to your lover,</p>
<p>seeing that your promise might lapse through time alone!</p>
<p>Why should I beg, miserably? Perhaps another wife</p>
<p>has you, and that love which served me so badly, now:</p>
<p>How I?m forgotten by you, I think: a no-body, the Phyllis you knew.</p>
<p>Ah me! If you ask what Phyllis this might be, and from where,</p>
<p>I?m she who gave you shelter and friendship in Thrace:</p>
<p>you, Demophoon, driven by long wanderings:</p>
<p>I who added my wealth to you, to whom, rich in effect,</p>
<p>I gave many gifts, many that I was given:</p>
<p>she who brought you the wide kingdom of Lycurgus,</p>
<p>scarcely fit to be ruled in a woman?s name,</p>
<p>where sacred Hebrus extends, from icy Rhodope</p>
<p>to shadowy Haemus, and drives out the gathered waters,</p>
<p>you, who took my virginity, with sinister omens,</p>
<p>and loosed my chaste ties, with a deceiving hand.</p>
<p>Tisiphone, in attendance, howled at this marriage,</p>
<p>and the gloomy bird gave its solitary cry.</p>
<p>Allecto was there, entwined with tiny snakes,</p>
<p>and the lights were changed to funeral torches.</p>
<p>Though I am gloomy, I walk the cliffs and tangled shore:</p>
<p>wherever the wide sea is open to my gaze.</p>
<p>Whether the earth is warmed by day, or the cold stars shine,</p>
<p>I look to see what wind stirs the waves.</p>
<p>And whatever sails I see far-off, approaching,</p>
<p>I take them straight away as a sign from the gods.</p>
<p>I rush into the fickle sea, struggling with tenacious waves,</p>
<p>there, where the ocean breakers extend.</p>
<p>As the sails grow larger, I am less and less able to stand,</p>
<p>I faint and fall into my servants? arms.</p>
<p>The bay is drawn in a faintly scythe-shaped arc:</p>
<p>the ends of its horns rise in a sheer cliff.</p>
<p>Here I had a mind to hurl myself into the swelling waves</p>
<p>- and since you will go on failing me, I will.</p>
<p>The tide will carry me, abandoned, to your shore</p>
<p>and your eyes will meet with my unburied body.</p>
<p>so that, though iron, and steel, and you, excel in hardness,</p>
<p>you will say: ?Phyllis, this was not the way to follow me!?</p>
<p>Often I thirst for poison, often I?d like to die</p>
<p>a bloody death, pierced by a sword.</p>
<p>My neck too, since faithless arms offered to encircle it,</p>
<p>I?d like to entangle in a noose.</p>
<p>Mature thought upholds tender honour by dying:</p>
<p>there is little point in delaying the choice of death.</p>
<p>Inscribe the hateful reason on my tomb,</p>
<p>you?ll be known by these or similar lines:</p>
<p>?Demophoon, the guest, gave loving Phyllis to death:</p>
<p>he offered her reason to die, by her own hand.</p>
<p>III: Briseis to Achilles
</p>
<p>The letter you read comes from Briseis, a captive:</p>
<p>its Greek, hardly written well by a barbarian hand.</p>
<p>Whatever you read, will be blotted with tears:</p>
<p>but still even tears carry the weight of my voice.</p>
<p>If it?s right to complain, a little, of you my lover,</p>
<p>and master: of master and lover, a little, I complain.</p>
<p>It?s not your fault I was quickly ordered to be handed over,</p>
<p>to King Agamemnon ? however this is your fault:</p>
<p>when Eurybates and Talthybius both called to take me,</p>
<p>I, your companion, was given to Eurybates and Talthybius.</p>
<p>Glancing at each other?s face, they questioned,</p>
<p>silently, where our love might be.</p>
<p>I could have delayed: delayed punishment might have been welcome.</p>
<p>Ah me! I gave you no kiss in leaving!</p>
<p>But I shed tears endlessly and tore my hair:</p>
<p>I am unhappy finding myself, once more, a prisoner.</p>
<p>I have often wished I might return, deceiving my guard:</p>
<p>but whoever might catch this timid girl, is an enemy.</p>
<p>If I could get right away, however, I feared I?d be caught at night,</p>
<p>to be sent as a gift to some woman of Priam?s household.</p>
<p>But I may be given back, since I was given. I?ve been absent</p>
<p>so many nights, and no recall. You are idle, and slow to anger.</p>
<p>Patroclus himself, when I was handed over, whispered</p>
<p>in my ear: ?Why cry, you?ll be here again in a little while.?</p>
<p>Scarcely thought of: you disagree with my return, Achilles.</p>
<p>Go, now, and keep your name as a fond lover!</p>
<p>Ajax and Phoenix came to you, Telamon and Amyntor?s sons,</p>
<p>the one related to you by blood, the other a friend,</p>
<p>and Ulysses, Laertes?s son: I might be returned through them:</p>
<p>they added many valuable gifts to their entreaties:</p>
<p>twenty cauldrons made of yellow bronze,</p>
<p>and seven tripods of equal weight and art.</p>
<p>Added to that were ten talents of gold,</p>
<p>and twelve horses, always accustomed to winning.</p>
<p>And, what were superfluous, girls of outstanding beauty,</p>
<p>captured when their island of Lesbos was overthrown:</p>
<p>and with all this ? but you don?t need a bride ?</p>
<p>a bride, one of Agamemnon?s three daughters.</p>
<p>If I might have been ransomed to you by Atrides, at a price,</p>
<p>why did you refuse to accept what you ought to have given?</p>
<p>For what fault of mine did I deserve to become worthless to you, Achilles? Where has gentle love gone, fleeing so swiftly, from us?</p>
<p>Or does sad fortune press hard on the wretched,</p>
<p>and no sweeter hour may come to my endeavours?</p>
<p>I saw you destroy the walls of Lyrnessus by your warfare</p>
<p>and I was an important person in my country.</p>
<p>I saw three brothers fall, who were born and died together,</p>
<p>whose mother was my mother also.</p>
<p>I saw my husband, how dear to me, spilled on the cruel earth,</p>
<p>his bloodstained chest heaving.</p>
<p>Yet, with so many lost, you alone made up for them:</p>
<p>you were lord, you were husband, you were brother to me.</p>
<p>Swearing by your mother the sea-goddess Thetis?s power,</p>
<p>you said to me that to have been a captive was useful in itself ?</p>
<p>no doubt, so that though I came with a dowry, you might reject me, and shun me, and what might have given wealth to you!</p>
<p>Indeed it?s even said you?ll set full sails to the South wind,</p>
<p>that brings the cloud, when tomorrow?s dawn shines clear.</p>
<p>What a crime that the fearful winds of misery touched me,</p>
<p>and the heart of life was empty of feeling.</p>
<p>You?ll go &#8211; O pity me! ? to what violent man do you abandon me?</p>
<p>Who will comfort my tenderness when I?m deserted?</p>
<p>I pray that I might be swallowed by some sudden crack in the earth,</p>
<p>or be burned by red fire hurled out by the lightning,</p>
<p>before Phthian oars whiten the waves without me,</p>
<p>and I see your ships sail, leaving me behind.</p>
<p>If it?s your return and your father?s gods that please you now,</p>
<p>I?ll be no great burden to your fleet.</p>
<p>I?d follow the victor as his captive, not a husband as his wife:</p>
<p>I could work the wool: its fitting for my hands.</p>
<p>Far off among the Greek women the most beautiful bride</p>
<p>will enter your bed, and she?ll be worthy to be a daughter-in-law</p>
<p>to her father-in-law Peleus, descendant of Jove and Aegina,</p>
<p>of whom old Nereus well might wish to be a grandfather to the wife.</p>
<p>I?ll be a humble servant spinning out the day?s work</p>
<p>and thinning the full distaff into my threads.</p>
<p>I beg you not to let your wife scold me too much,</p>
<p>not knowing if she will be at all kind to me,</p>
<p>nor suffer my hair to be pulled out in your presence,</p>
<p>with you saying lightly: ?She too was mine.?</p>
<p>Perhaps suffering?s better, since I?m indeed contemptible, forsaken:</p>
<p>here fear shakes my bones ? alas the wretchedness!</p>
<p>Still, what do you wait for? Agamemnon regrets his anger</p>
<p>and lays out all Greece, in mourning, before your feet.</p>
<p>Conquer your feelings and anger, you who?ve conquered all else!</p>
<p>Why should Hector actively destroy the Greek forces?</p>
<p>Take up your arms, Aeacides ?but take me back first ?</p>
<p>and overcome those troublesome men aided by Mars!</p>
<p>Your anger was stirred because of me: through me let it fade,</p>
<p>and let me be the cause, and end, of your sorrows.</p>
<p>Don?t think it shameful to yield to my prayers:</p>
<p>Meleager was turned towards war by his wife?s prayer.</p>
<p>It?s a tale I?ve heard, one known to you: bereaved of her brothers</p>
<p>by her son, her hope and heir, the mother cursed him.</p>
<p>There was a war: he proudly withdrew, refusing battle,</p>
<p>and, stubborn of mind, refused aid to his country.</p>
<p>Only his wife could persuade the man ? happier was she! ?</p>
<p>but my words fail, and carry little weight.</p>
<p>Yet I?m not displeased that I?ve not performed as a wife,</p>
<p>as a slave I was summoned more often to my master?s bed.</p>
<p>I remember once some captive called me mistress ?</p>
<p>I said: ?The weight of that name adds to the slavery.?</p>
<p>Yet I swear by my husband?s bones, scarce buried</p>
<p>in a hasty grave: they are always sacred, to my judgement:</p>
<p>and by the three spirits of my brave brothers, gods to me,</p>
<p>who died well, for and with their country,</p>
<p>and by your body and mine that we joined as one,</p>
<p>and by your swords known to our weapons,</p>
<p>no Mycenean has shared the bed with me:</p>
<p>you might wish to abandon one who deceived.</p>
<p>If I now said to you: ?Bravest, you too swear to me</p>
<p>you?ve never made love without me? ? you?d refuse.</p>
<p>Now the Greeks think you?re grieving ? but you play music,</p>
<p>a sweet friend clasps you to her warm breast.</p>
<p>and if anyone asks why you decline to fight ?</p>
<p>fighting?s harmful, while Venus, and nights with the lyre, delight.</p>
<p>It?s safer to lie there in bed, holding a girl tight,</p>
<p>strumming the Thracian lyre with your fingers,</p>
<p>than bearing a shield and a sharp-pointed spear in your hands,</p>
<p>and a helmet that presses down on your hair.</p>
<p>Yet, instead of safety, conspicuous action pleased you,</p>
<p>and a glorious part in the fighting was sweet.</p>
<p>Or was it merely that while you might still capture me,</p>
<p>you approved of fierce war, and your glory died with my country?</p>
<p>May the gods alter that! And I pray, that the spear from Pelion,</p>
<p>hurled from a strong arm, pierces Hector?s side!</p>
<p>Send me to him, you Greeks! As delegate, I?ll beg my lord,</p>
<p>and mingle many kisses with your requests.</p>
<p>I?ll achieve more than Phoenix, more than eloquent Ulysses,</p>
<p>more than Ajax, Teucer?s brother, believe me.</p>
<p>It?s something to have been embraced by familiar arms</p>
<p>and to have recalled his eyes to oneself in person!</p>
<p>Though you may be harsher, and fiercer than your mother?s waves,</p>
<p>I?ll suppress my tears in order to stay silent.</p>
<p>Now too ? so that your father Peleus may complete long years,</p>
<p>so your son Pyrrhus might take up arms under your auspices! ?</p>
<p>have regard for anxious Briseis, mighty Achilles,</p>
<p>don?t oppress the miserable girl, cruelly, with long delay:</p>
<p>but if your love has turned to loathing of me,</p>
<p>force me to die, who am forced to live without you!</p>
<p>Yet you do force me. My flesh and colour fade:</p>
<p>the one hope I still have left is that of your feelings.</p>
<p>If I lose that, I?ll join my husband and my brothers:</p>
<p>why even order it? Attack my body with your naked sword,</p>
<p>I have blood that should flow from my pierced breast.</p>
<p>Attack me with that sword, which, if Thetis had allowed,</p>
<p>would have entered Agamemnon? breast!</p>
<p>Ah! Rather, save my life, your gift to me!</p>
<p>What the conqueror granted his enemy, I ask as a friend.</p>
<p>You can destroy better things, those that Neptune gave</p>
<p>to Troy: seek matter in the enemy you kill!</p>
<p>Only, order me, on my lord?s authority, to come: whether you prepare your fleet to be driven by oars, or whether you stay!</p>
<p>IV: Phaedra to Hippolytus
</p>
<p>The Cretan girl, who lacks health unless he grants it her,</p>
<p>wishes good health to the man who?s an Amazon?s son.</p>
<p>Read what is here. How could reading a letter harm you?</p>
<p>There might even be something in it that pleases you.</p>
<p>My secrets are carried, by these letters, over land and sea:</p>
<p>even enemies read letters received from their enemies.</p>
<p>I?ve tried to speak to you three times, three times my tongue</p>
<p>clung to my mouth, three times the sound died on my lips.</p>
<p>It?s right and natural that shame is mingled with love:</p>
<p>love ordered me to write, to say what shames me.</p>
<p>Whatever love commands cannot be wholly denied:</p>
<p>he rules and is a law among the gods.</p>
<p>He told me to pen words, in my first confusion:</p>
<p>?Write! Having conquered, he?ll give his cruel hand.?</p>
<p>He helps me, and, seeing that he heats my marrow with greedy fire,</p>
<p>he may also fix your affections as I wish.</p>
<p>I would not break my marriage contract through sin ?</p>
<p>you can enquire ? my reputation?s free of any stain.</p>
<p>Love that comes late is deeper. We burn within: we burn:</p>
<p>and our feelings suffer the secret wounds:</p>
<p>I suppose that, as a young ox is chafed by the yoke,</p>
<p>and a horse captured from the herd scarcely suffers the harness,</p>
<p>so with great difficulty, with rawness, the heart suffers new love.</p>
<p>and this burden does not lie easy on my spirit.</p>
<p>When guilt?s fully learnt in early years, it becomes an art:</p>
<p>love that comes with the claims of time, loves less easily.</p>
<p>You will enjoy a new libation, one that has been guarded from sin,</p>
<p>and both of us will become equally guilty.</p>
<p>What?s plucked from the loaded branches in the orchard</p>
<p>is valuable, and the rose first gathered by slender fingers.</p>
<p>But even if that first purity, that I bring you free of sin,</p>
<p>were to be marked by this unaccustomed stain,</p>
<p>then I would still accept being burnt by a worthy fire:</p>
<p>a vile adulterer is more harmful than the adultery.</p>
<p>If Juno yielded me Jupiter, her husband and brother,</p>
<p>I?d consider Hippolytus preferable to Jove!</p>
<p>Now too ? you?ll scarcely believe this ? I take up new arts:</p>
<p>I have the urge to be among wild creatures:</p>
<p>now my chief goddess is Diana, known for her curved bow:</p>
<p>in following her I follow your preference:</p>
<p>I love to pass through the woods and drive deer into my nets,</p>
<p>urging my swift hounds over the tops of the hills,</p>
<p>or launch a quivering spear from my trembling arm,</p>
<p>or throw my body down on the grassy earth.</p>
<p>often I delight in driving a light chariot through the dust,</p>
<p>and twisting the bit in the mouth of a fleeing horse,</p>
<p>Now I?m swept away, like the Maenads roused by Bacchic frenzy,</p>
<p>like those who beat their drums on the slopes of Mount Ida,</p>
<p>or those semi-divine Dryads, and twin-horned Fauns,</p>
<p>who are stunned, touched by his power.</p>
<p>And then others relate it all, when the madness abates:</p>
<p>I silently burn, conscious of love.</p>
<p>Perhaps by my fate I?m paying for the passions of my race,</p>
<p>and Venus may be seeking a tribute from all the tribe.</p>
<p>Jupiter loved Europa, as a bull, hiding his godhead,</p>
<p>? she was the first origin of our people.</p>
<p>A burden and a reproach was born from the womb</p>
<p>of my mother, Pasiphae, mounted by a bull she tricked.</p>
<p>Treacherous Theseus, following the guiding thread</p>
<p>escaped the labyrinth with the help of Ariadne, my sister.</p>
<p>Indeed, I now, lest I might be thought no child of Minos,</p>
<p>am the latest to be subject to the common rules of my tribe.</p>
<p>This was destined too: one House pleased both of us:</p>
<p>your beauty captivated me, your father?s my sister.</p>
<p>Theseus and his son have seized on two sisters:</p>
<p>build twin memorials to us then in your house!</p>
<p>At the time when I entered Ceres?s Eleusis ?</p>
<p>the soil of Crete should have held me back ?</p>
<p>then you above all pleased me (though you had before):</p>
<p>fierce love clung to me in the depths of my bones.</p>
<p>You were clothed in white, your hair surrounded by flowers,</p>
<p>a modest blush tinged your golden cheeks:</p>
<p>others call your face grim and severe,</p>
<p>in Phaedra?s judgment that severity is strength.</p>
<p>let men who are adorned like women stay far from me:</p>
<p>beauty loves the masculine, adorned in moderation.</p>
<p>That severity of yours suits you, hair placed without art,</p>
<p>and the light dust on your distinguished face.</p>
<p>I admire it if you struggle with the arched necks of fiery horses,</p>
<p>forcing them to turn their hooves in a tight circle:</p>
<p>or if you calmly hurl the javelin with your strong arm,</p>
<p>your warlike face turned towards your shoulder:</p>
<p>or grasp the wide-bladed hunting spear of cornel wood ?</p>
<p>in the end whatever you do delights my eyes.</p>
<p>Only expend your harshness on the wooded hills:</p>
<p>I?m not a fit subject to be destroyed by you.</p>
<p>Why delight in the study of high-girt Diana?s occupation,</p>
<p>and avoid what you owe to Venus?</p>
<p>What lacks rest now and then, will not last:</p>
<p>rest renews the powers, and restores weary limbs.</p>
<p>The bow (indeed, your weapons imitate Diana?s)</p>
<p>which never ceases to be strung, grows slack.</p>
<p>Cephalus was distinguished in hunting, and many creatures</p>
<p>were killed, among the grasses, by his blows:</p>
<p>yet he didn?t do badly in yielding to Aurora?s lovemaking:</p>
<p>the discreet goddess went to him from her aged husband.</p>
<p>The grass beneath the oak trees often held</p>
<p>Venus and Adonis, both, lying there relaxed.</p>
<p>And Meleager was on fire for Arcadian Atalanta:</p>
<p>she had the wild boar?s hide as a token of his love.</p>
<p>We too could soon be numbered in this throng!</p>
<p>If you take Love away your woods are uncivilised.</p>
<p>I?ll come myself as your companion, the hidden rocks</p>
<p>don?t worry me, nor fear of the boar?s curving tooth.</p>
<p>Two seas pound the Isthmus with their waves,</p>
<p>and the slender stretch of land hears both their waters.</p>
<p>There I might live with you, in Troezen, Pittheus?s kingdom:</p>
<p>it?s now a country dearer to me than my own.</p>
<p>Theseus, Neptune?s son, has been away a while, and will be, longer,</p>
<p>Pirithous keeps him there in his country.</p>
<p>Theseus, unless we deny what?s obvious,</p>
<p>prefers Pirithous to Phaedra, and Pirithous to you.</p>
<p>That is not all: injury comes to us from him:</p>
<p>we have both been wounded deeply, in fact.</p>
<p>Breaking my brother?s bones with his three-knotted club,</p>
<p>he scattered them over the soil: left my sister a prey to wild beasts.</p>
<p>Your mother, worthy, by her energy, of her son, bore you,</p>
<p>she the most courageous of the axe-wielding Amazon girls.</p>
<p>If you ask where she is, Theseus pierced her body with his sword:</p>
<p>not even such a child as you guaranteed her safety!</p>
<p>Indeed she was not even a bride, experiencing the wedding torch ?</p>
<p>why, if not that you, a bastard, mightn?t hold your father?s kingdom?</p>
<p>Brothers he took from me, he gave to you. Yet I was not</p>
<p>the reason for taking them all away, he was.</p>
<p>O I wish the harm done you, in your heart?s core,</p>
<p>might be ended by the most beautiful of actions!</p>
<p>Come now, show your respect for your worthy father?s bed like this:</p>
<p>he who fled, and himself disowned his deeds.</p>
<p>Nor, because I?d be seen as a stepmother coupling with her stepson, should you let your mind fear those empty names.</p>
<p>That old morality was held to be dying, as far as future ages,</p>
<p>were concerned, by Saturn, in his primitive kingdom.</p>
<p>Whatever might give Jupiter pleasure he declared lawful,</p>
<p>and divine law allows any sister to be married to her brother.</p>
<p>The tie is firm that?s made by procreation,</p>
<p>those bonds that Venus herself imposes.</p>
<p>It?s no effort to hide them, though! Seek the gift from her</p>
<p>of being able to mask guilt by known kinship.</p>
<p>Let someone see us embrace: we?ll both be praised,</p>
<p>I?ll be said to be a stepmother loyal to her stepson.</p>
<p>Not for you the unbarring of a harsh husband?s gate,</p>
<p>in the shadows, nor the deceiving of a guardian:</p>
<p>the house will hold as one, what it held as two.</p>
<p>Open kisses you gave, open kisses you?ll give.</p>
<p>You?ll be safe with me, and guilt will earn praise,</p>
<p>even if you are observed in my bed.</p>
<p>Rid yourself of delay, and join quickly in a compact!</p>
<p>Love will spare you, then, that which rages in me now!</p>
<p>I don?t scorn to be a suppliant, or beg humbly of you.</p>
<p>Ah! Where are pride and noble words now? Lost!</p>
<p>And I was certain I?d struggle for a long time ?</p>
<p>if Love can be certain ? and not submit to sin.</p>
<p>Conquered, I beg you, and clasp your knees with royal arms.</p>
<p>No lover thinks about what?s fitting.</p>
<p>I have no shame, and shame, fleeing, relinquishes its standards.</p>
<p>Acknowledge the favour given and conquer your hard heart!</p>
<p>For Minos, who is my father, rules the seas,</p>
<p>the lightning comes from one grandfather, Jupiter?s raised hand,</p>
<p>the other, Sol, his forehead fenced with sharp rays,</p>
<p>drives his gleaming chariot through the heat of day ?</p>
<p>Nobility lies here subject to love: pity my forefathers</p>
<p>and if your power cannot spare me, spare them!</p>
<p>The land of Crete, Jupiter?s island, is my dowry:</p>
<p>all my kingdom would serve Hippolytus.</p>
<p>Cruel man, change your mind! My mother could seduce a bull:</p>
<p>will you be more savage than that wild bull?</p>
<p>Spare me, I beg you, by Venus who?s closest to me:</p>
<p>and so may you never love, what scorns you:</p>
<p>may the nimble goddess be with you in secret glades,</p>
<p>may the deep woods offer you creatures for plunder:</p>
<p>may the Satyrs and the Pans, mountain gods, favour you,</p>
<p>and the wild boar fall, pierced by your opposing spear:</p>
<p>may the nymphs, though you?re said to hate the girls,</p>
<p>give you that water which quenches parching thirst!</p>
<p>I add tears also to these prayers. You who read</p>
<p>words of prayer, imagine that you can also see my tears!</p>
<p>V: Oenone to Paris
</p>
<p>The Nymph sends words you ordered her to write,</p>
<p>from Mount Ida, to her Paris, though you refuse her as yours.</p>
<p>Will you read them? Or does your new wife forbid it?</p>
<p>Read! This is not a letter created by a Mycenean hand.</p>
<p>I, Oenone, the fountain-nymph, famous in Phrygian woods,</p>
<p>wounded, complain of you, who are my own if you allow it.</p>
<p>What god opposes my prayers with his divine will?</p>
<p>Might I be suffering from some crime of yours that harms me?</p>
<p>Whatever one deserves to suffer should be borne lightly:</p>
<p>what comes undeservedly, comes as bitter punishment.</p>
<p>You were not important as yet, when I was happy</p>
<p>with you as my husband, I, a nymph born of a mighty river.</p>
<p>You who now are a son of Priam, (let fear of the truth be absent)</p>
<p>were a slave: the nymph endured marriage with a slave!</p>
<p>We often rested our flocks, hidden among the trees,</p>
<p>leaves, mingled with grass, offered us a bed.</p>
<p>Often lying on straw, and in the deep hay,</p>
<p>a humble roof sheltered us from the hoar frost.</p>
<p>Who showed you the glades that suit the quarry,</p>
<p>and where the wild beast hides her cubs among the rocks?</p>
<p>Often, as your companion, I?ve set the wide-meshed nets,</p>
<p>often I?ve led swift hounds over the long slopes.</p>
<p>The beech trees guard my name, cut there by you,</p>
<p>and I read ?Oenone?, written there by your knife:</p>
<p>And as the trunk grows, my name grows the same:</p>
<p>grow, and rise straight, in honour of my name!</p>
<p>I remember, a poplar, rooted by a flowing stream,</p>
<p>on which letters are carved, testaments to us.</p>
<p>Live, poplar, I pray, which rooted on the edge of the bank,</p>
<p>that holds this verse in your wrinkled bark:</p>
<p>?If Paris breathed while Oeneone were forsaken,</p>
<p>Scamander?s waters would flow backwards to their source.?</p>
<p>Scamander, rush backwards, turn your streams around!</p>
<p>Paris allows Oenone to be deserted.</p>
<p>That day spoke my miserable fate, on that evil day</p>
<p>winter began to transform our love,</p>
<p>when Venus and Juno, and Minerva, who is more comely armed,</p>
<p>came, naked, to receive your judgement.</p>
<p>My stunned heart trembled, and a cold tremor,</p>
<p>ran through solid bone, as I heard that being told.</p>
<p>I took council (not afraid of much as yet) with old women</p>
<p>and age-old men: they agreed it was wrong.</p>
<p>Fir-trees were felled, and timbers cut, a fleet prepared,</p>
<p>and the blue waves received the new-caulked vessels.</p>
<p>You wept on leaving. Don?t deny that, at least:</p>
<p>your love is more shameful to you than in the past.</p>
<p>You wept and saw my eyes filled with tears:</p>
<p>we both mixed our grief and tears together.</p>
<p>The elm?s not smothered, by the vine, more closely</p>
<p>than I, your arms entwined with my neck.</p>
<p>Ah how many times, when you complained the wind</p>
<p>was feeble, your companions laughed ? it was fine.</p>
<p>How many times you dismissed me repeatedly!</p>
<p>How your tongue could scarcely bear to say: ?Farewell!?</p>
<p>The light breeze stirred slack sails on the firm mast</p>
<p>and the oars whitened the swirling water.</p>
<p>Unhappy I followed the departing sail with my eyes,</p>
<p>as is right, and my tears wet the sand,</p>
<p>and I begged the sea-green Nereids that you might come back soon ?</p>
<p>so, no doubt, you could return quickly to my harm.</p>
<p>Did you return at my prayers, returning with another?</p>
<p>Ah me, my flattering speech was for a rival!</p>
<p>A vast natural cliff looks down onto the deep,</p>
<p>(once part of the mountain) and meets the ocean tide:</p>
<p>Here I was first to recognise the sails of your ships</p>
<p>and I desired to rush into the waves.</p>
<p>While I hesitated, I became afraid of royal-purple robes</p>
<p>that gleamed towards me from the height of the prow:</p>
<p>to wear that was no fashion of yours.</p>
<p>It grew nearer, and the boat touched shore with the swift breeze:</p>
<p>with trembling heart I saw a female face.</p>
<p>As if that was not enough ? why did I still wait there madly? ?</p>
<p>your vile mistress clung to your chest!</p>
<p>Then truly I tore my clothes, and beat my breast</p>
<p>and scratched my wet cheeks with sharp nails,</p>
<p>and filled sacred Ida with howls of complaint</p>
<p>I carried my tears there among the rocks.</p>
<p>So may Helen grieve and weep, abandoned by her lover,</p>
<p>let her suffer what she first brought me!</p>
<p>Now those women suit you, who leave their rightful husbands</p>
<p>to follow you over the open sea.</p>
<p>When you were a poor man, and a shepherd driving the flock,</p>
<p>the poor man had only his wife Oenone.</p>
<p>I?m not amazed by wealth, nor does your palace move me,</p>
<p>nor to be spoken of as one of Priam?s many daughters:</p>
<p>however Priam would not refuse to be father-in-law to a nymph,</p>
<p>nor would that daughter-in-law be concealed by Hecuba.</p>
<p>I am worthy, and wish, to become the wife of a powerful man:</p>
<p>I have hands that might grace a sceptre.</p>
<p>Don?t despise me, because I lay with you among the beech leaves:</p>
<p>I?m more suited to a bed of royal purple.</p>
<p>In the end my love is safe: here no war?s prepared</p>
<p>the waves carry no vengeful ships.</p>
<p>The fugitive daughter of Tyndareus needs dangerous weapons:</p>
<p>she comes to your bed with a magnificent dowry.</p>
<p>Ask your brother Hector, or Deiphobus or Polydamas,</p>
<p>whether she should be returned to the Greeks:</p>
<p>consult as to what grave Antenor, or Priam himself, would urge,</p>
<p>who have been in command for many years.</p>
<p>It?s shameful to start preferring a stolen woman to your country.</p>
<p>It?s a cause of shame to you: a just husband takes up arms.</p>
<p>Don?t expect the Spartan to be loyal to you, if you?re wise,</p>
<p>she who fell so quickly into your embrace.</p>
<p>Like Menelaus who cries out at the desecration of his marriage bed,</p>
<p>and wounded grieves at this love for a stranger,</p>
<p>you will also cry. Wounded chastity is restored</p>
<p>by no art: it remains lost for ever.</p>
<p>She?s on fire with your love: just so, she loved Menelaus;</p>
<p>now, too trusting, he lies there in an empty bed.</p>
<p>Happy Andromache is truly married to a good husband:</p>
<p>take your brother?s wife as an example.</p>
<p>You are lighter than leaves, without weight of sap,</p>
<p>flying along, dried by the fickle winds.</p>
<p>And there?s less weight in you than a fragile ear of wheat,</p>
<p>that stiffens, parched by the continual sun.</p>
<p>Your sister Cassandra once chanted, (now I recall)</p>
<p>prophesying to me, with her hair unbound:</p>
<p>?What are you doing, Oenone? Why sow seed in the sand?</p>
<p>Ox, you plough the shore in vain!</p>
<p>The Greek heifer comes, who will destroy you house and lands!</p>
<p>Oh prevent her! The Greek heifer?s coming!</p>
<p>While you can, sink the obscene vessel in the sea!</p>
<p>Alas! How much Trojan blood she carries!?</p>
<p>She spoke: her servants led her away, her madness in full flight,</p>
<p>but my yellow hair stood on end.</p>
<p>Ah, prophetess, you were only too right about my woes:</p>
<p>see, the Greek heifer occupies my field!</p>
<p>Though her beauty is distinguished, she?s truly adulterous:</p>
<p>captivated by a guest, abandoning her husband?s gods.</p>
<p>Theseus (unless the name?s wrong, I?m unsure which Theseus)</p>
<p>stole her away from her country before.</p>
<p>A young man, and passionate, do we believe she returned a virgin?</p>
<p>How did I learn all this, you rightly ask? I love!</p>
<p>You might call it violence, and hide her crime, by a word:</p>
<p>but she who gets raped so often, offers herself to rape.</p>
<p>Oeonone remains chaste, though betrayed by her husband ?</p>
<p>and you might have been betrayed yourself, by your rules:</p>
<p>The swift Satyrs, with hasty foot, an insolent crowd,</p>
<p>searched for me (I hid secretly in the woods)</p>
<p>and horned Faunus, his head crowned with bristling pine,</p>
<p>there, where Mount Ida swells up in vast ridges.</p>
<p>Noble Tros, who built Troy, loved me truly:</p>
<p>he took the prize of my virginity.</p>
<p>By a struggle too: all the same, his hair was torn,</p>
<p>and his face was scratched, by my fingernails.</p>
<p>I didn?t ask gold and gems for the price of my unchastity:</p>
<p>it?s shameful for gifts to buy a free-born body.</p>
<p>He entrusted me with his arts of medicine, certain I was worthy,</p>
<p>and allowed my hands to use his gifts.</p>
<p>I know every useful herb, with power to aid,</p>
<p>and every healing root, growing in the world.</p>
<p>Alas for me, that love?s not curable with herbs!</p>
<p>The skill in that art?s lacking from my arts.</p>
<p>The creator of these gifts himself they say was frightened</p>
<p>of Thessalian cattle: and was wounded by my passion.</p>
<p>What neither the fruitful earth with its herbs, nor a god,</p>
<p>can create, that help you can bring to me.</p>
<p>You can and I deserve it. Pity this worthy girl!</p>
<p>I don?t bring Greeks and bloodstained weapons.</p>
<p>But I am yours, and I was yours in our tender years,</p>
<p>and I pray I might be yours, while time endures.</p>
<p>VI: Hypsipyle to Jason
</p>
<p>Hypsipyle of Lemnos, born of the people of Bacchus,</p>
<p>speaks to Jason: how much of your heart was truly in your words?</p>
<p>You?re said to have reached Thessaly?s shore in your returning ship,</p>
<p>rich with the fleece of the golden ram.</p>
<p>I give thanks for your safety, as much as you might allow:</p>
<p>yet surely the letter itself should have come from you.</p>
<p>For though you might not have had the winds, as you wished,</p>
<p>so as not to be driven beyond the kingdoms I granted:</p>
<p>however adverse the wind, Hypsipyle was worthy</p>
<p>of being sent a sealed letter of greeting!</p>
<p>Why does rumour reach me, with news, before a letter:</p>
<p>the sacred bulls of Mars going under the yoke,</p>
<p>a crop of warriors growing from scattered seed</p>
<p>and their deaths not requiring your efforts,</p>
<p>the watchful dragon guarding the hide of the ram</p>
<p>yet the golden fleece snatched by your brave hand?</p>
<p>If I could say this timidly to the doubters: ?He himself</p>
<p>wrote this to me?, how fine that would be!</p>
<p>Why complain at the sense of duty of an indifferent husband?</p>
<p>If I?m still yours, I?ve been shown great indulgence.</p>
<p>It?s been said that a barbarous sorceress came back with you</p>
<p>to be welcomed to that half of the bed you promised me.</p>
<p>Love?s a credulous thing. If only it?s thoughtless speech</p>
<p>that has charged a man with false crimes!</p>
<p>Recently a guest came to me from Thessalian shores,</p>
<p>and had scarcely crossed the threshold when I said:</p>
<p>?How is my Jason faring?? He hung there,</p>
<p>shame-faced, his eyes fixed on the ground.</p>
<p>I leapt up immediately, and tearing my tunic from my breast,</p>
<p>I shouted: ?Does he live, or does death call me, also??</p>
<p>?He lives,? he said timidly: I forced that timid man to swear it.</p>
<p>I scarcely believe you live even with a god as witness.</p>
<p>As my reason returns, I begin to inquire about your deeds:</p>
<p>He tells of your ploughing with the bronze-footed bulls,</p>
<p>the dragon?s teeth sown in the earth instead of seed</p>
<p>and the sudden warriors bearing arms,</p>
<p>an earthborn people killed in civil war</p>
<p>fulfilling their life?s destiny in a day.</p>
<p>The dragon defeated. Again, I ask if Jason lives:</p>
<p>belief alternates with hope and fear.</p>
<p>While he relates each tale, he reveals, by his ability,</p>
<p>in the eagerness, and the flow of his story, my wounds.</p>
<p>Oh, where?s the loyalty promised? Where?s the marriage oath,</p>
<p>and the torch better fitted to plunge beneath my funeral pyre?</p>
<p>I was not known to you secretly. Juno was present at the wedding</p>
<p>and Hymen, his brow was crowned with garlands.</p>
<p>Yet neither Juno nor Hymen, but dismal bloodstained Erinys</p>
<p>carried her torches of ill-luck before me.</p>
<p>What are the Minyans to me? Or ships and Tritons?</p>
<p>Or Tiphys the Argo?s helmsman, and my country, to you?</p>
<p>There?s no ram here with a remarkable golden fleece,</p>
<p>nor was Lemnos the kingdom of old Colchian King Aeetes.</p>
<p>True, at first ? but my evil fate drew me on ?</p>
<p>I intended to drive the stranger away with my army of women</p>
<p>and they know how to overcome Lemnian men ? too much so!</p>
<p>His life was protected by such a resolute army!</p>
<p>I saw that man into my city, admitted him to my house and heart.</p>
<p>Here two summers and two winters passed you by.</p>
<p>It was the third harvest when you contracted to sail,</p>
<p>mixing words like these with your tears:</p>
<p>?I?m dragged away from you Hypsipyle. May fate only let me return:</p>
<p>I leave here as your husband, your husband I?ll always be.</p>
<p>But that of mine that?s hidden in your pregnant womb,</p>
<p>will live, and we should both be parents to it!?</p>
<p>So you spoke. And, tears falling from your lying cheeks,</p>
<p>I remember you could say nothing more to me.</p>
<p>Of the comrades you embarked last on the sacred Argo:</p>
<p>it sped away, the wind took your billowing sails.</p>
<p>The dark-blue waves well up from your driving keel:</p>
<p>The land?s gazed at by you, the sea by me.</p>
<p>A wide tower, open on all sides, surveys the waves:</p>
<p>there I suffer and tears wet my face and breast.</p>
<p>I gaze through tears, and my eyes see further</p>
<p>than they used to do, sharpened by loving feelings.</p>
<p>Now, also, add to them chaste prayers for your safety,</p>
<p>mingled with anxious vows, to be fulfilled by me.</p>
<p>Shall I fulfil the vows? Medea may enjoy the fruits of sacrifice!</p>
<p>My heart grieves, and overflows, with anger mixed with love.</p>
<p>Shall I take gifts to the temples because Jason lives who I?ve lost?</p>
<p>Should some victim die at a blow because of the harm to me?</p>
<p>I was anxious, and always afraid, lest your father</p>
<p>might arrange for a daughter-in-law from a city of Argolis.</p>
<p>I feared the Argolid ? yet it?s a barbarian rival that harms me!</p>
<p>I never expected to suffer this wound from your enemy.</p>
<p>It?s not her face or merits that enchant you, but the charms she knows</p>
<p>and the herbs, cut, with fearful incantations.</p>
<p>She could labour to draw the reluctant moon from her course</p>
<p>and hide the horses of the sun in darkness:</p>
<p>she could hold back the waters, and halt the falling streams,</p>
<p>she could move woods, and natural rocks, from their place.</p>
<p>She wanders through the tombs, clothes loose, hair dishevelled,</p>
<p>and collects particular bones from tepid funeral pyres.</p>
<p>She bewitches absent folk: she pierces wax effigies,</p>
<p>and forces fine needles into their wretched livers.</p>
<p>And what it might be better for me not to have known: wrongly, love?s sought, and its nature?s to be bought, by magic practices.</p>
<p>Can you embrace her, without fear, in the one bed,</p>
<p>enjoying sleep, in the silence of the night?</p>
<p>I suppose she forced you to bear the yoke, like those bulls:</p>
<p>and like cruel dragons, you too are lulled by her powers.</p>
<p>Add that she favours attributing your long list of deeds to herself</p>
<p>and that the wife?s name harms the husband?s.</p>
<p>Someone of Pelias?s party could ascribe your successes to poisons,</p>
<p>and there are people who might believe him, saying:</p>
<p>?It wasn?t Jason, but Medea of Phasis, Aeetes?s daughter</p>
<p>who stripped the golden fleece from the Phrixean ram?</p>
<p>Alcimede, your mother, doesn?t approve ? seek her council! ?</p>
<p>nor your father: she?s a daughter-in-law come from the frozen pole.</p>
<p>Let her find a husband from the Don, or the damp Scythian marshes,</p>
<p>or even from her homeland of Phasis, for herself.</p>
<p>Fickle son of Aeson, more uncertain than a spring breeze,</p>
<p>why do your words of promise lack substance?</p>
<p>You who?d gone from here my husband, didn?t return so from there ?</p>
<p>if I might be restored as your wife, I?d be as before your going.</p>
<p>If high birth and a noble name move you:</p>
<p>see, I was born the daughter of Thoas and of Ariadne.</p>
<p>Bacchus was my grandfather: as Bacchus?s wife she wears a crown,</p>
<p>and her constellation outshines the lesser stars.</p>
<p>Lemnos will be my gift to you: a land ripe for cultivation:</p>
<p>and you shall have me too with the rest of my dowry.</p>
<p>Now I have given birth, also. Rejoice for us both, Jason ?</p>
<p>sweetly it?s author had made a burden for my womb.</p>
<p>I?m happy in their number, as well, and produced twin boys,</p>
<p>favoured by Lucina with a double pledge.</p>
<p>I you ask who they are like, you?ll be able to identify them:</p>
<p>they don?t know how to pretend they have any other father.</p>
<p>I nearly gave them up to be seen as ambassadors for their mother,</p>
<p>but a cruel stepmother stood in the way of that undertaking.</p>
<p>I feared Medea ? a stepmother indeed ?</p>
<p>Medea?s hands are made for every wickedness.</p>
<p>She who could scatter the torn limbs of her brother, Absyrtus,</p>
<p>over the fields, would she spare my children?</p>
<p>O you, maddened and confused by Colchian drugs,</p>
<p>do you still say she?s preferable to Hypsipyles in bed?</p>
<p>Shamefully that girl knew a man in adultery:</p>
<p>chaste marriage gave me to you, and you to me.</p>
<p>She betrayed her father ? I snatched my Thoas from death.</p>
<p>She abandoned Colchis ? I have my Lemnos.</p>
<p>What does matter, then, if wickedness overcomes piety,</p>
<p>if she is endowed by crime itself, and it earns her a husband?</p>
<p>Jason, I don?t admire the crime the Lemnian women committed!</p>
<p>However indignation grants itself a coward?s weapons.</p>
<p>If hostile winds as they ought had forced you and your friends</p>
<p>to enter my harbour, and I?d come out to meet you with young twins ? surely you?d have asked the earth to swallow you! ? say, wretch, with what look would you have gazed at me, and your children?</p>
<p>What death would have been fitting reward for such treachery?</p>
<p>In fact you would have been safe and sound because of me,</p>
<p>not because you deserved it, but because I am kind.</p>
<p>I would have drenched my face with my rival?s blood,</p>
<p>and yours that she stole with her magic arts.</p>
<p>I would have been Medea to Medea. Why, if he who is on high, Jupiter the Just, himself, assists my prayers,</p>
<p>let her grieve herself for what Hypsipyle bewails, a rival</p>
<p>in my bed, and feel the effect of her own laws,</p>
<p>and as I am forsaken, a wife, and mother of two children,</p>
<p>may she be bereaved of similar children, and her husband!</p>
<p>May she not keep her evil place for long, and forsake worse:</p>
<p>may she be exiled, and search the whole world for refuge.</p>
<p>What the sister was to the brother, the daughter to the unlucky father,</p>
<p>let that harsh woman be to her husband and her children!</p>
<p>When she?s exhausted sea and land, let her try the air:</p>
<p>may she wander helpless, hopeless, bloodied by her crimes.</p>
<p>I, daughter of Thoas, cheated of my husband, beg this:</p>
<p>?Live man and bride in an accursed bed!?</p>
<p>VII: Dido to Aeneas
</p>
<p>Dardanian, receive this song of dying Elissa:</p>
<p>what you read are the last words written by me.</p>
<p>At fate?s call, the white swan, despondent on the grass,</p>
<p>sings, like this, to the waters of Maeander.</p>
<p>I do not speak because I hope to move you with prayers:</p>
<p>I offer up my prayers to a hostile god!</p>
<p>But since I may have wholly wasted my reputation for merit,</p>
<p>and for chaste body and spirit, the waste of words is nothing.</p>
<p>You?re still determined to go, abandoning wretched Dido,</p>
<p>and the same wind will carry off your sails and promises.</p>
<p>Aeneas, you?re determined to break your pledge, loose</p>
<p>your ships, to seek domains in Italy, where, you do not know.</p>
<p>You are not moved by New Carthage, its growing walls,</p>
<p>or the supreme power entrusted to you by the sceptre.</p>
<p>You flee what?s done, you seek what is to do: yet searching</p>
<p>for another kingdom in the world, it?s already found.</p>
<p>If you reach that country who?d surrender it to you?</p>
<p>Who?d give possession of his fields to an unknown?</p>
<p>Another love?s in store for you, another Dido,</p>
<p>and another pledge being given, you?ll again deceive.</p>
<p>Where might you create a city as good as Carthage,</p>
<p>and look out on your people from its high fortress?</p>
<p>If it all came to pass, and the gods did not delay your hopes,</p>
<p>where would you find a wife, to love you like this?</p>
<p>I am scorched like wax torches dipped in sulphur,</p>
<p>like holy incense added to smoking pyres.</p>
<p>My sleepless eyes cling, always, to Aeneas:</p>
<p>I?ve Aeneas in my mind day and night.</p>
<p>It?s true that he?s ungrateful, and silent about my gifts,</p>
<p>and if I weren?t a fool, I?d wish to be free.</p>
<p>yet I don?t hate Aeneas, though he might think badly of me,</p>
<p>though I complain of his treachery, still I love him more.</p>
<p>Venus, spare your daughter-in-law, and Love, my brother,</p>
<p>embrace your hard-hearted brother: let him serve in your ranks.</p>
<p>So I, who began this love ? I don?t scorn indeed to say this ?</p>
<p>might offer him the substance of my affections.</p>
<p>I?m cheated and this is a false idea I speak of:</p>
<p>he differs from his mother in disposition.</p>
<p>Begotten by stones, or hills, or native oaks</p>
<p>on tall cliffs, by savage beasts, or by the sea</p>
<p>such as you now gaze on, stirred by the winds:</p>
<p>why do you still prepare to battle with adverse tides?</p>
<p>Where do you flee to? Storms obstruct you. The storms? aid</p>
<p>will benefit me! See how the wind excites the crashing waves.</p>
<p>The storm I wished for you, comes to pass without me:</p>
<p>wind and wave are more just to me than your heart.</p>
<p>I?m not worth so much that you should perish, unjustly,</p>
<p>by not being stopped from fleeing me over the wide seas.</p>
<p>You?d be cultivating constancy and hatred too lavishly,</p>
<p>if, though free of me, you met a common fate,</p>
<p>Soon the winds will die, and, evenly, over the level waves,</p>
<p>Triton will drive his dark-green horses through the waters.</p>
<p>I wish that you too might be altered like the winds,</p>
<p>and you will, unless you?re harder than an oak.</p>
<p>Why, unless you?re ignorant of how furious the seas can be,</p>
<p>do you so often, so wrongly, trust the waters you?ve tried?</p>
<p>Even, when you loose the hawsers, persuaded by the tide,</p>
<p>still the wide sea holds many sorrows.</p>
<p>It?s no use tempting the waves, when faith?s been violated:</p>
<p>there punishment?s demanded for treachery,</p>
<p>especially when love is wounded, because, Venus, it?s said,</p>
<p>the mother of Love, was born naked from Cythera?s waters.</p>
<p>Lost, I fear lest I lose, and harm the one who harmed,</p>
<p>lest my enemy, shipwrecked, drink the salt breakers.</p>
<p>Live, I beg you! Thus I?d curse you more harshly than if you died,</p>
<p>you?d be more widely known as the cause of my death.</p>
<p>Come, imagine, if you were snatched up by a swift whirlwind ?</p>
<p>let there be no weight to that omen ? what would be in your mind?</p>
<p>Immediately the perjury of your false tongue will strike you</p>
<p>and Dido, forced to die by Phrygian deceit:</p>
<p>the image of the wife you cheated would stand before your eyes,</p>
<p>in sorrow, and with loosened bloodstained hair.</p>
<p>However many times you say: ?Forgive me, I deserved it all!?</p>
<p>you?ll find each one a thunderbolt falling on you!</p>
<p>Grant a little space to your cruelty, and the sea:</p>
<p>a safe path in future will be the great reward for your delay.</p>
<p>If you?ve no care for me: spare your child Iulus!</p>
<p>It?s enough for you to bear notoriety for my death.</p>
<p>Why do that son, Ascanius, and your household gods deserve this?</p>
<p>Shall the waves bury those gods you rescued from the fire?</p>
<p>But you did not bring them with you, as you told me, traitor,</p>
<p>nor did your sacred father straddle your shoulders.</p>
<p>You lied about it all: for your lying tongue did not</p>
<p>start with me, nor am I the first one to be punished:</p>
<p>if you ask where Creusa is, the lovely mother of Iulus ?</p>
<p>she died alone, abandoned by a hard-hearted husband!</p>
<p>You told me this, but in winning me you suppressed it.</p>
<p>From that minor fault, came my future punishment.</p>
<p>I?ve no doubt that your gods condemn you:</p>
<p>storm-ridden for seven years, by land and sea.</p>
<p>Spewed up by the waves, I received you to a safe harbour</p>
<p>and, scarce having heard your name aright, gave you a kingdom.</p>
<p>Yet I wish I?d been contented with those services</p>
<p>and my reputation not buried by our union!</p>
<p>That day harmed me, when a sudden dark rainstorm</p>
<p>forced us to shelter under the roof of a cave.</p>
<p>I heard a voice: I thought it the nymphs? wailing:</p>
<p>it was the Furies giving warning of my fate.</p>
<p>Exact my punishment, wounded Honour, and by the violated</p>
<p>laws of my marriage-bed leave no reputation to my ashes.</p>
<p>And you ghost, and spirit, and ashes of my Sychaeus</p>
<p>to whom, alas for me, filled with shame I go.</p>
<p>Sychaeus is honoured by me in a marble shrine:</p>
<p>covered by shadowing branches, with their white strands of wool.</p>
<p>From it, four times, I heard his familiar voice, calling me by name:</p>
<p>his tones, faintly, saying: ?Elissa, come!?</p>
<p>No delay: I come: I come to you, a wife in debt ?</p>
<p>yet still I am late through confessing to my shame!</p>
<p>Grant forgiveness of my sin: he was worthy, he who deceived me:</p>
<p>that it was him removes the evil from my offence.</p>
<p>His divine mother, Venus, and the son?s pious burden, his old father, Anchises, gave me hope he?d be a true husband to me.</p>
<p>If I was mistaken, the error had an honest cause:</p>
<p>add my loyalty, and nothing?s to be regretted.</p>
<p>The course of my fate holds true to the end,</p>
<p>and runs clear to the last day of my existence:</p>
<p>My husband, Sychaeus, died at the altar of his house</p>
<p>and my wicked brother, Pygmalion, has the spoils.</p>
<p>Exiled from Tyre, I left my country, my husband?s ashes,</p>
<p>and endured harsh journeys, pursued by enemies.</p>
<p>Escaping my brother and the sea, I was brought to unknown lands,</p>
<p>and I won this shore, that I granted to you, faithless man.</p>
<p>I founded Carthage, and laid out wide walls on every side,</p>
<p>a cause of envy to the neighbouring peoples.</p>
<p>War broke out. A stranger, and a woman, they tested me by war,</p>
<p>and I?d barely prepared the weapons and defences of my new city.</p>
<p>I was flattered by a thousand suitors, plaintive to wed me,</p>
<p>and I don?t know which of their marriage beds I preferred.</p>
<p>Why hesitate to surrender me in chains to Iarba, of the Gaetuli?</p>
<p>I will have offered my arms up to your wickedness.</p>
<p>There is my brother, too, whose impious hand demands</p>
<p>to be sprinkled with my blood, already stained by my husband?s.</p>
<p>Set aside the gods, and the holy things you profane by touching!</p>
<p>It?s not well for an impious hand to worship the heavens.</p>
<p>If you were their future supporter escaped from the fire,</p>
<p>it?s a shame that the gods themselves escaped the flames.</p>
<p>Wicked man, you abandon both pregnant Dido</p>
<p>and that part of you hidden enclosed by my body.</p>
<p>You add the infant?s death to the unhappy mother?s,</p>
<p>and you?ll be author of the funeral of your unborn child.</p>
<p>Iulus?s brother will die with his mother,</p>
<p>and one punishment will destroy the two of us.</p>
<p>?But the god orders me to go.? I wish he had prevented your</p>
<p>coming to Carthage, its earth from being touched by a Trojan.</p>
<p>Led by this god, are you not driven by adverse winds,</p>
<p>and endlessly scoured by ravening seas?</p>
<p>Returning to Troy had scarcely been so much effort for you</p>
<p>if it were as great as when Hector was alive.</p>
<p>You don?t seek your father?s Simois, but Tiber?s streams,</p>
<p>surely, when you reach the place you wish, you?ll be an enemy.</p>
<p>While the land, you force yourself on, hides and shuns your ships,</p>
<p>you?ll hardly be able to touch what you seek until you?re old.</p>
<p>Rather you should accept this nation, without quibbling,</p>
<p>as my dowry, and the riches of Pygmalion I brought here.</p>
<p>Transform this happier Phoenician city into Troy,</p>
<p>and rule this place, and hold the sacred sceptre!</p>
<p>If your mind?s eager for war, if Iulus asks, what victorious part</p>
<p>might fall to him in battle, we?ll have no lack of enemies</p>
<p>to offer him, for him to overcome: here he can cultivate</p>
<p>the conditions for peace, here too a place for arms.</p>
<p>Only ? by your mother Venus, and your brother?s arms, his arrows,</p>
<p>and the sacred Trojan gods companions of your flight! ?</p>
<p>may whoever of your race you brought, so conquer,</p>
<p>and cruel Mars bring an end to your troubles,</p>
<p>and Ascanius fulfil his years in happiness</p>
<p>and old Anchises?s bones rest in peace!</p>
<p>I beg you, spare this house that surrenders ownership to you!</p>
<p>What crime could you say was mine except having loved?</p>
<p>I was not born in Greece, in Phthia, or great Mycenae,</p>
<p>my husband and father did not depend on you.</p>
<p>If it?s shameful to marry me, call me friend not wife:</p>
<p>so long as Dido is yours, she?ll endure anything.</p>
<p>I know how the waves strike the African shore:</p>
<p>and grant or deny a passage at certain times:</p>
<p>when the wind grants you way, you may unfurl your sails:</p>
<p>then fickle weeds enclose your grounded boat.</p>
<p>Trust me to watch for the right time: you?ll leave more certainly,</p>
<p>and even if you wish it, I won?t let you stay.</p>
<p>And your companions need rest, and the sails of your ships,</p>
<p>half-repaired, require some further delay.</p>
<p>By my kindnesses, if I am destined for you, beyond this,</p>
<p>by those hopes of union I beg a little time:</p>
<p>while the seas grow calmer, while love?s eased by familiarity,</p>
<p>I learn to bear my sorrows more firmly.</p>
<p>If not, I have the courage to pour away my life:</p>
<p>your harshness cannot endure within me long.</p>
<p>I wish you could see my appearance as I write:</p>
<p>I write, and a Trojan sword lies in my lap:</p>
<p>and tears fall from my cheeks onto the naked blade,</p>
<p>which will soon be stained with tears of blood.</p>
<p>How truly fitting your gift is for my death,</p>
<p>you prepare my funeral at little cost.</p>
<p>Nor is this the first wound, from a weapon, my heart suffers:</p>
<p>that place bears the wound of cruel love.</p>
<p>Anna, sister, sister Anna, sadly conscious of my crime,</p>
<p>soon you must give the last offerings to my ashes.</p>
<p>Do not write ?Sychaeus?s Elissa?, when I?m consumed by fire,</p>
<p>let this verse, alone, appear on my marble tomb:</p>
<p>?Aeneas offered a reason to die, and the sword.</p>
<p>Dido killed herself by her own hand.?</p>
