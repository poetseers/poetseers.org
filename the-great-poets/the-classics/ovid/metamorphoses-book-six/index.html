				<p>The Transformation of Arachne into a Spider</p>
<p>Pallas, attending to the Muse&#8217;s song, <br />
Approv&#8217;d the just resentment of their wrong; <br />
And thus reflects: While tamely I commend <br />
Those who their injur&#8217;d deities defend, <br />
My own divinity affronted stands, <br />
And calls aloud for justice at my hands; <br />
Then takes the hint, asham&#8217;d to lag behind, <br />
And on Arachne&#8217; bends her vengeful mind; <br />
One at the loom so excellently skill&#8217;d, <br />
That to the Goddess she refus&#8217;d to yield. <br />
Low was her birth, and small her native town, <br />
She from her art alone obtain&#8217;d renown. <br />
Idmon, her father, made it his employ, <br />
To give the spungy fleece a purple dye: <br />
Of vulgar strain her mother, lately dead, <br />
With her own rank had been content to wed; <br />
Yet she their daughter, tho&#8217; her time was spent <br />
In a small hamlet, and of mean descent, <br />
Thro&#8217; the great towns of Lydia gain&#8217;d a name, <br />
And fill&#8217;d the neighb&#8217;ring countries with her fame.</p>
<p>Oft, to admire the niceness of her skill, <br />
The Nymphs would quit their fountain, shade, or hill: <br />
Thither, from green Tymolus, they repair, <br />
And leave the vineyards, their peculiar care; <br />
Thither, from fam&#8217;d Pactolus&#8217; golden stream, <br />
Drawn by her art, the curious Naiads came. <br />
Nor would the work, when finish&#8217;d, please so much, <br />
As, while she wrought, to view each graceful touch; <br />
Whether the shapeless wool in balls she wound, <br />
Or with quick motion turn&#8217;d the spindle round, <br />
Or with her pencil drew the neat design, <br />
Pallas her mistress shone in every line. <br />
This the proud maid with scornful air denies, <br />
And ev&#8217;n the Goddess at her work defies; <br />
Disowns her heav&#8217;nly mistress ev&#8217;ry hour, <br />
Nor asks her aid, nor deprecates her pow&#8217;r. <br />
Let us, she cries, but to a tryal come, <br />
And, if she conquers, let her fix my doom.</p>
<p>The Goddess then a beldame&#8217;s form put on, <br />
With silver hairs her hoary temples shone; <br />
Prop&#8217;d by a staff, she hobbles in her walk, <br />
And tott&#8217;ring thus begins her old wives&#8217; talk.</p>
<p>Young maid attend, nor stubbornly despise <br />
The admonitions of the old, and wise; <br />
For age, tho&#8217; scorn&#8217;d, a ripe experience bears, <br />
That golden fruit, unknown to blooming years: <br />
Still may remotest fame your labours crown, <br />
And mortals your superior genius own; <br />
But to the Goddess yield, and humbly meek <br />
A pardon for your bold presumption seek; <br />
The Goddess will forgive. At this the maid, <br />
With passion fir&#8217;d, her gliding shuttle stay&#8217;d; <br />
And, darting vengeance with an angry look, <br />
To Pallas in disguise thus fiercely spoke.</p>
<p>Thou doating thing, whose idle babling tongue <br />
But too well shews the plague of living long; <br />
Hence, and reprove, with this your sage advice, <br />
Your giddy daughter, or your aukward neice; <br />
Know, I despise your counsel, and am still <br />
A woman, ever wedded to my will; <br />
And, if your skilful Goddess better knows, <br />
Let her accept the tryal I propose.</p>
<p>She does, impatient Pallas strait replies, <br />
And, cloath&#8217;d with heavenly light, sprung from her odd disguise. <br />
The Nymphs, and virgins of the plain adore <br />
The awful Goddess, and confess her pow&#8217;r; <br />
The maid alone stood unappall&#8217;d; yet show&#8217;d <br />
A transient blush, that for a moment glow&#8217;d, <br />
Then disappear&#8217;d; as purple streaks adorn <br />
The opening beauties of the rosy morn; <br />
Till Phoebus rising prevalently bright, <br />
Allays the tincture with his silver light. <br />
Yet she persists, and obstinately great, <br />
In hopes of conquest hurries on her fate. <br />
The Goddess now the challenge waves no more, <br />
Nor, kindly good, advises as before. <br />
Strait to their posts appointed both repair, <br />
And fix their threaded looms with equal care: <br />
Around the solid beam the web is ty&#8217;d, <br />
While hollow canes the parting warp divide; <br />
Thro&#8217; which with nimble flight the shuttles play, <br />
And for the woof prepare a ready way; <br />
The woof and warp unite, press&#8217;d by the toothy slay.</p>
<p>Thus both, their mantles button&#8217;d to their breast, <br />
Their skilful fingers ply with willing haste, <br />
And work with pleasure; while they chear the eye <br />
With glowing purple of the Tyrian dye: <br />
Or, justly intermixing shades with light, <br />
Their colourings insensibly unite. <br />
As when a show&#8217;r transpierc&#8217;d with sunny rays, <br />
Its mighty arch along the heav&#8217;n displays; <br />
From whence a thousand diff&#8217;rent colours rise, <br />
Whose fine transition cheats the clearest eyes; <br />
So like the intermingled shading seems, <br />
And only differs in the last extreams. <br />
Then threads of gold both artfully dispose, <br />
And, as each part in just proportion rose, <br />
Some antique fable in their work disclose.</p>
<p>Pallas in figures wrought the heav&#8217;nly Pow&#8217;rs, <br />
And Mars&#8217;s hill among th&#8217; Athenian tow&#8217;rs. <br />
On lofty thrones twice six celestials sate, <br />
Jove in the midst, and held their warm debate; <br />
The subject weighty, and well-known to fame, <br />
From whom the city shou&#8217;d receive its name. <br />
Each God by proper features was exprest, <br />
Jove with majestick mein excell&#8217;d the rest. <br />
His three-fork&#8217;d mace the dewy sea-God shook, <br />
And, looking sternly, smote the ragged rock; <br />
When from the stone leapt forth a spritely steed, <br />
And Neptune claims the city for the deed.</p>
<p>Herself she blazons, with a glitt&#8217;ring spear, <br />
And crested helm that veil&#8217;d her braided hair, <br />
With shield, and scaly breast-plate, implements of war. <br />
Struck with her pointed launce, the teeming Earth <br />
Seem&#8217;d to produce a new surprizing birth; <br />
When, from the glebe, the pledge of conquest sprung, <br />
A tree pale-green with fairest olives hung.</p>
<p>And then, to let her giddy rival learn <br />
What just rewards such boldness was to earn, <br />
Four tryals at each corner had their part, <br />
Design&#8217;d in miniature, and touch&#8217;d with art. <br />
Haemus in one, and Rodope of Thrace <br />
Transform&#8217;d to mountains, fill&#8217;d the foremost place; <br />
Who claim&#8217;d the titles of the Gods above, <br />
And vainly us&#8217;d the epithets of Jove. <br />
Another shew&#8217;d, where the Pigmaean dame, <br />
Profaning Juno&#8217;s venerable name, <br />
Turn&#8217;d to an airy crane, descends from far, <br />
And with her Pigmy subjects wages war. <br />
In a third part, the rage of Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s great queen, <br />
Display&#8217;d on proud Antigone, was seen: <br />
Who with presumptuous boldness dar&#8217;d to vye, <br />
For beauty with the empress of the sky. <br />
Ah! what avails her ancient princely race, <br />
Her sire a king, and Troy her native place: <br />
Now, to a noisy stork transform&#8217;d, she flies, <br />
And with her whiten&#8217;d pinions cleaves the skies. <br />
And in the last remaining part was drawn <br />
Poor Cinyras that seem&#8217;d to weep in stone; <br />
Clasping the temple steps, he sadly mourn&#8217;d <br />
His lovely daughters, now to marble turn&#8217;d. <br />
With her own tree the finish&#8217;d piece is crown&#8217;d, <br />
And wreaths of peaceful olive all the work surround.</p>
<p>Arachne drew the fam&#8217;d intrigues of Jove, <br />
Chang&#8217;d to a bull to gratify his love; <br />
How thro&#8217; the briny tide all foaming hoar, <br />
Lovely Europa on his back he bore. <br />
The sea seem&#8217;d waving, and the trembling maid <br />
Shrunk up her tender feet, as if afraid; <br />
And, looking back on the forsaken strand, <br />
To her companions wafts her distant hand. <br />
Next she design&#8217;d Asteria&#8217;s fabled rape, <br />
When Jove assum&#8217;d a soaring eagle&#8217;s shape: <br />
And shew&#8217;d how Leda lay supinely press&#8217;d, <br />
Whilst the soft snowy swan sate hov&#8217;ring o&#8217;er her breast, <br />
How in a satyr&#8217;s form the God beguil&#8217;d, <br />
When fair Antiope with twins he fill&#8217;d. <br />
Then, like Amphytrion, but a real Jove, <br />
In fair Alcmena&#8217;s arms he cool&#8217;d his love. <br />
In fluid gold to Danae&#8217;s heart he came, <br />
Aegina felt him in a lambent flame. <br />
He took Mnemosyne in shepherd&#8217;s make, <br />
And for Deois was a speckled snake.</p>
<p>She made thee, Neptune, like a wanton steer, <br />
Pacing the meads for love of Arne dear; <br />
Next like a stream, thy burning flame to slake, <br />
And like a ram, for fair Bisaltis&#8217; sake. <br />
Then Ceres in a steed your vigour try&#8217;d, <br />
Nor cou&#8217;d the mare the yellow Goddess hide. <br />
Next, to a fowl transform&#8217;d, you won by force <br />
The snake-hair&#8217;d mother of the winged horse; <br />
And, in a dolphin&#8217;s fishy form, subdu&#8217;d <br />
Melantho sweet beneath the oozy flood.</p>
<p>All these the maid with lively features drew, <br />
And open&#8217;d proper landskips to the view. <br />
There Phoebus, roving like a country swain, <br />
Attunes his jolly pipe along the plain; <br />
For lovely Isse&#8217;s sake in shepherd&#8217;s weeds, <br />
O&#8217;er pastures green his bleating flock he feeds, <br />
There Bacchus, imag&#8217;d like the clust&#8217;ring grape, <br />
Melting bedrops Erigone&#8217;s fair lap; <br />
And there old Saturn, stung with youthful heat, <br />
Form&#8217;d like a stallion, rushes to the feat. <br />
Fresh flow&#8217;rs, which twists of ivy intertwine, <br />
Mingling a running foliage, close the neat design.</p>
<p>This the bright Goddess passionately mov&#8217;d, <br />
With envy saw, yet inwardly approv&#8217;d. <br />
The scene of heav&#8217;nly guilt with haste she tore, <br />
Nor longer the affront with patience bore; <br />
A boxen shuttle in her hand she took, <br />
And more than once Arachne&#8217;s forehead struck. <br />
Th&#8217; unhappy maid, impatient of the wrong, <br />
Down from a beam her injur&#8217;d person hung; <br />
When Pallas, pitying her wretched state, <br />
At once prevented, and pronounc&#8217;d her fate: <br />
Live; but depend, vile wretch, the Goddess cry&#8217;d, <br />
Doom&#8217;d in suspence for ever to be ty&#8217;d; <br />
That all your race, to utmost date of time, <br />
May feel the vengeance, and detest the crime.</p>
<p>Then, going off, she sprinkled her with juice, <br />
Which leaves of baneful aconite produce. <br />
Touch&#8217;d with the pois&#8217;nous drug, her flowing hair <br />
Fell to the ground, and left her temples bare; <br />
Her usual features vanish&#8217;d from their place, <br />
Her body lessen&#8217;d all, but most her face. <br />
Her slender fingers, hanging on each side <br />
With many joynts, the use of legs supply&#8217;d: <br />
A spider&#8217;s bag the rest, from which she gives <br />
A thread, and still by constant weaving lives.</p>
<p>The Story of Niobe</p>
<p>Swift thro&#8217; the Phrygian towns the rumour flies, <br />
And the strange news each female tongue employs: <br />
Niobe, who before she married knew <br />
The famous nymph, now found the story true; <br />
Yet, unreclaim&#8217;d by poor Arachne&#8217;s fate, <br />
Vainly above the Gods assum&#8217;d a state. <br />
Her husband&#8217;s fame, their family&#8217;s descent, <br />
Their pow&#8217;r, and rich dominion&#8217;s wide extent, <br />
Might well have justify&#8217;d a decent pride; <br />
But not on these alone the dame rely&#8217;d. <br />
Her lovely progeny, that far excell&#8217;d, <br />
The mother&#8217;s heart with vain ambition swell&#8217;d: <br />
The happiest mother not unjustly styl&#8217;d, <br />
Had no conceited thoughts her tow&#8217;ring fancy fill&#8217;d.</p>
<p>For once a prophetess with zeal inspir&#8217;d, <br />
Their slow neglect to warm devotion fir&#8217;d; <br />
Thro&#8217; ev&#8217;ry street of Thebes who ran possess&#8217;d, <br />
And thus in accents wild her charge express&#8217;d: <br />
Haste, haste, ye Theban matrons, and adore, <br />
With hallow&#8217;d rites, Latona&#8217;s mighty pow&#8217;r; <br />
And, to the heav&#8217;nly twins that from her spring, <br />
With laurel crown&#8217;d, your smoaking incense bring. <br />
Strait the great summons ev&#8217;ry dame obey&#8217;d, <br />
And due submission to the Goddess paid: <br />
Graceful, with laurel chaplets dress&#8217;d, they came, <br />
And offer&#8217;d incense in the sacred flame.</p>
<p>Mean-while, surrounded with a courtly guard, <br />
The royal Niobe in state appear&#8217;d; <br />
Attir&#8217;d in robes embroider&#8217;d o&#8217;er with gold, <br />
And mad with rage, yet lovely to behold: <br />
Her comely tresses, trembling as she stood, <br />
Down her fine neck with easy motion flow&#8217;d; <br />
Then, darting round a proud disdainful look, <br />
In haughty tone her hasty passion broke, <br />
And thus began: What madness this, to court <br />
A Goddess, founded meerly on report? <br />
Dare ye a poor pretended Pow&#8217;r invoke, <br />
While yet no altars to my godhead smoke? <br />
Mine, whose immediate lineage stands confess&#8217;d <br />
From Tantalus, the only mortal guest <br />
That e&#8217;er the Gods admitted to their feast. <br />
A sister of the Pleiads gave me birth; <br />
And Atlas, mightiest mountain upon Earth, <br />
Who bears the globe of all the stars above, <br />
My grandsire was, and Atlas sprung from Jove. <br />
The Theban towns my majesty adore, <br />
And neighb&#8217;ring Phrygia trembles at my pow&#8217;r: <br />
Rais&#8217;d by my husband&#8217;s lute, with turrets crown&#8217;d, <br />
Our lofty city stands secur&#8217;d around. <br />
Within my court, where-e&#8217;er I turn my eyes, <br />
Unbounded treasures to my prospect rise: <br />
With these my face I modestly may name, <br />
As not unworthy of so high a claim; <br />
Seven are my daughters, of a form divine, <br />
With seven fair sons, an indefective line. <br />
Go, fools! consider this; and ask the cause <br />
From which my pride its strong presumption draws; <br />
Consider this; and then prefer to me <br />
Caeus the Titan&#8217;s vagrant progeny; <br />
To whom, in travel, the whole spacious Earth <br />
No room afforded for her spurious birth. <br />
Not the least part in Earth, in Heav&#8217;n, or seas, <br />
Would grant your out-law&#8217;d Goddess any ease: <br />
&#8216;Till pitying hers, from his own wand&#8217;ring case, <br />
Delos, the floating island, gave a place. <br />
There she a mother was, of two at most; <br />
Only the seventh part of what I boast. <br />
My joys all are beyond suspicion fix&#8217;d; <br />
With no pollutions of misfortune mix&#8217;d; <br />
Safe on the Basis of my pow&#8217;r I stand, <br />
Above the reach of Fortune&#8217;s fickle hand. <br />
Lessen she may my inexhausted store, <br />
And much destroy, yet still must leave me more. <br />
Suppose it possible that some may dye <br />
Of this my num&#8217;rous lovely progeny; <br />
Still with Latona I might safely vye. <br />
Who, by her scanty breed, scarce fit to name, <br />
But just escapes the childless woman&#8217;s shame. <br />
Go then, with speed your laurel&#8217;d heads uncrown, <br />
And leave the silly farce you have begun.</p>
<p>The tim&#8217;rous throng their sacred rites forbore, <br />
And from their heads the verdant laurel tore; <br />
Their haughty queen they with regret obey&#8217;d, <br />
And still in gentle murmurs softly pray&#8217;d.</p>
<p>High, on the top of Cynthus&#8217; shady mount, <br />
With grief the Goddess saw the base affront; <br />
And, the abuse revolving in her breast, <br />
The mother her twin-offspring thus addrest.</p>
<p>Lo I, my children, who with comfort knew <br />
Your God-like birth, and thence my glory drew; <br />
And thence have claim&#8217;d precedency of place <br />
From all but Juno of the heav&#8217;nly race, <br />
Must now despair, and languish in disgrace. <br />
My godhead question&#8217;d, and all rites divine, <br />
Unless you succour, banish&#8217;d from my shrine. <br />
Nay more, the imp of Tantalus has flung <br />
Reflections with her vile paternal tongue; <br />
Has dar&#8217;d prefer her mortal breed to mine, <br />
And call&#8217;d me childless; which, just fate, may she repine!</p>
<p>When to urge more the Goddess was prepar&#8217;d, <br />
Phoebus in haste replies, Too much we&#8217;ve heard, <br />
And ev&#8217;ry moment&#8217;s lost, while vengeance is defer&#8217;d. <br />
Diana spoke the same. Then both enshroud <br />
Their heav&#8217;nly bodies in a sable cloud; <br />
And to the Theban tow&#8217;rs descending light, <br />
Thro&#8217; the soft yielding air direct their flight.</p>
<p>Without the wall there lies a champian ground <br />
With even surface, far extending round, <br />
Beaten and level&#8217;d, while it daily feels <br />
The trampling horse, and chariot&#8217;s grinding wheels. <br />
Part of proud Niobe&#8217;s young rival breed, <br />
Practising there to ride the manag&#8217;d steed, <br />
Their bridles boss&#8217;d with gold, were mounted high <br />
On stately furniture of Tyrian dye. <br />
Of these, Ismenos, who by birth had been <br />
The first fair issue of the fruitful queen, <br />
Just as he drew the rein to guide his horse, <br />
Around the compass of the circling course, <br />
Sigh&#8217;d deeply, and the pangs of smart express&#8217;d, <br />
While the shaft stuck, engor&#8217;d within his breast: <br />
And, the reins dropping from his dying hand, <br />
He sunk quite down, and tumbled on the sand. <br />
Sipylus next the rattling quiver heard, <br />
And with full speed for his escape prepar&#8217;d; <br />
As when the pilot from the black&#8217;ning skies <br />
A gath&#8217;ring storm of wintry rain descries, <br />
His sails unfurl&#8217;d, and crowded all with wind, <br />
He strives to leave the threat&#8217;ning cloud behind: <br />
So fled the youth; but an unerring dart <br />
O&#8217;ertook him, quick discharg&#8217;d, and sped with art; <br />
Fix&#8217;d in his neck behind, it trembling stood, <br />
And at his throat display&#8217;d the point besmear&#8217;d with blood <br />
Prone, as his posture was, he tumbled o&#8217;er, <br />
And bath&#8217;d his courser&#8217;s mane with steaming gore. <br />
Next at young Phaedimus they took their aim, <br />
And Tantalus who bore his grandsire&#8217;s name: <br />
These, when their other exercise was done, <br />
To try the wrestler&#8217;s oily sport begun; <br />
And, straining ev&#8217;ry nerve, their skill express&#8217;d <br />
In closest grapple, joining breast to breast: <br />
When from the bending bow an arrow sent, <br />
Joyn&#8217;d as they were, thro&#8217; both their bodies went: <br />
Both groan&#8217;d, and writhing both their limbs with pain, <br />
They fell together bleeding on the plain; <br />
Then both their languid eye-balls faintly roul, <br />
And thus together breathe away their soul. <br />
With grief Alphenor saw their doleful plight, <br />
And smote his breast, and sicken&#8217;d at the sight; <br />
Then to their succour ran with eager haste, <br />
And, fondly griev&#8217;d, their stiff&#8217;ning limbs embrac&#8217;d; <br />
But in the action falls: a thrilling dart, <br />
By Phoebus guided, pierc&#8217;d him to the heart. <br />
This, as they drew it forth, his midriff tore, <br />
Its barbed point the fleshy fragments bore, <br />
And let the soul gush out in streams of purple gore. <br />
But Damasichthon, by a double wound, <br />
Beardless, and young, lay gasping on the ground. <br />
Fix&#8217;d in his sinewy ham, the steely point <br />
Stuck thro&#8217; his knee, and pierc&#8217;d the nervous joint: <br />
And, as he stoop&#8217;d to tug the painful dart, <br />
Another struck him in a vital part; <br />
Shot thro&#8217; his wezon, by the wing it hung. <br />
The life-blood forc&#8217;d it out, and darting upward sprung, <br />
Ilioneus, the last, with terror stands, <br />
Lifting in pray&#8217;r his unavailing hands; <br />
And, ignorant from whom his griefs arise, <br />
Spare me, o all ye heav&#8217;nly Pow&#8217;rs, he cries: <br />
Phoebus was touch&#8217;d too late, the sounding bow <br />
Had sent the shaft, and struck the fatal blow; <br />
Which yet but gently gor&#8217;d his tender side, <br />
So by a slight and easy wound he dy&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Swift to the mother&#8217;s ears the rumour came, <br />
And doleful sighs the heavy news proclaim; <br />
With anger and surprize inflam&#8217;d by turns, <br />
In furious rage her haughty stomach burns: <br />
First she disputes th&#8217; effects of heav&#8217;nly pow&#8217;r, <br />
Then at their daring boldness wonders more; <br />
For poor Amphion with sore grief distrest, <br />
Hoping to sooth his cares by endless rest, <br />
Had sheath&#8217;d a dagger in his wretched breast. <br />
And she, who toss&#8217;d her high disdainful head, <br />
When thro&#8217; the streets in solemn pomp she led <br />
The throng that from Latona&#8217;s altar fled, <br />
Assuming state beyond the proudest queen; <br />
Was now the miserablest object seen. <br />
Prostrate among the clay-cold dead she fell, <br />
And kiss&#8217;d an undistinguish&#8217;d last farewel. <br />
Then her pale arms advancing to the skies, <br />
Cruel Latona! triumph now, she cries. <br />
My grieving soul in bitter anguish drench, <br />
And with my woes your thirsty passion quench; <br />
Feast your black malice at a price thus dear, <br />
While the sore pangs of sev&#8217;n such deaths I bear. <br />
Triumph, too cruel rival, and display <br />
Your conqu&#8217;ring standard; for you&#8217;ve won the day. <br />
Yet I&#8217;ll excel; for yet, tho&#8217; sev&#8217;n are slain, <br />
Superior still in number I remain. <br />
Scarce had she spoke; the bow-string&#8217;s twanging sound <br />
Was heard, and dealt fresh terrors all around; <br />
Which all, but Niobe alone, confound. <br />
Stunn&#8217;d, and obdurate by her load of grief, <br />
Insensible she sits, nor hopes relief.</p>
<p>Before the fun&#8217;ral biers, all weeping sad, <br />
Her daughters stood, in vests of sable clad, <br />
When one, surpriz&#8217;d, and stung with sudden smart, <br />
In vain attempts to draw the sticking dart: <br />
But to grim death her blooming youth resigns, <br />
And o&#8217;er her brother&#8217;s corpse her dying head reclines. <br />
This, to asswage her mother&#8217;s anguish tries, <br />
And, silenc&#8217;d in the pious action, dies; <br />
Shot by a secret arrow, wing&#8217;d with death, <br />
Her fault&#8217;ring lips but only gasp&#8217;d for breath. <br />
One, on her dying sister, breathes her last; <br />
Vainly in flight another&#8217;s hopes are plac&#8217;d: <br />
This hiding, from her fate a shelter seeks; <br />
That trembling stands, and fills the air with shrieks. <br />
And all in vain; for now all six had found <br />
Their way to death, each by a diff&#8217;rent wound. <br />
The last, with eager care the mother veil&#8217;d, <br />
Behind her spreading mantle close conceal&#8217;d, <br />
And with her body guarded, as a shield. <br />
Only for this, this youngest, I implore, <br />
Grant me this one request, I ask no more; <br />
O grant me this! she passionately cries: <br />
But while she speaks, the destin&#8217;d virgin dies.</p>
<p>The Transformation of Niobe</p>
<p>Widow&#8217;d, and childless, lamentable state! <br />
A doleful sight, among the dead she sate; <br />
Harden&#8217;d with woes, a statue of despair, <br />
To ev&#8217;ry breath of wind unmov&#8217;d her hair; <br />
Her cheek still red&#8217;ning, but its colour dead, <br />
Faded her eyes, and set within her head. <br />
No more her pliant tongue its motion keeps, <br />
But stands congeal&#8217;d within her frozen lips. <br />
Stagnate, and dull, within her purple veins, <br />
Its current stop&#8217;d, the lifeless blood remains. <br />
Her feet their usual offices refuse, <br />
Her arms, and neck their graceful gestures lose: <br />
Action, and life from ev&#8217;ry part are gone, <br />
And ev&#8217;n her entrails turn to solid stone; <br />
Yet still she weeps, and whirl&#8217;d by stormy winds, <br />
Born thro&#8217; the air, her native country finds; <br />
There fix&#8217;d, she stands upon a bleaky hill, <br />
There yet her marble cheeks eternal tears distil.</p>
<p>The Peasants of Lycia transform&#8217;d to Frogs</p>
<p>Then all, reclaim&#8217;d by this example, show&#8217;d <br />
A due regard for each peculiar God: <br />
Both men, and women their devoirs express&#8217;d, <br />
And great Latona&#8217;s awful pow&#8217;r confess&#8217;d. <br />
Then, tracing instances of older time, <br />
To suit the nature of the present crime, <br />
Thus one begins his tale.- Where Lycia yields <br />
A golden harvest from its fertile fields, <br />
Some churlish peasants, in the days of yore, <br />
Provok&#8217;d the Goddess to exert her pow&#8217;r. <br />
The thing indeed the meanness of the place <br />
Has made obscure, surprizing as it was; <br />
But I my self once happen&#8217;d to behold <br />
This famous lake of which the story&#8217;s told. <br />
My father then, worn out by length of days, <br />
Nor able to sustain the tedious ways, <br />
Me with a guide had sent the plains to roam, <br />
And drive his well-fed stragling heifers home. <br />
Here, as we saunter&#8217;d thro&#8217; the verdant meads, <br />
We spy&#8217;d a lake o&#8217;er-grown with trembling reeds, <br />
Whose wavy tops an op&#8217;ning scene disclose, <br />
From which an antique smoaky altar rose. <br />
I, as my susperstitious guide had done, <br />
Stop&#8217;d short, and bless&#8217;d my self, and then went on; <br />
Yet I enquir&#8217;d to whom the altar stood, <br />
Faunus, the Naids, or some native God? <br />
No silvan deity, my friend replies, <br />
Enshrin&#8217;d within this hallow&#8217;d altar lies. <br />
For this, o youth, to that fam&#8217;d Goddess stands, <br />
Whom, at th&#8217; imperial Juno&#8217;s rough commands, <br />
Of ev&#8217;ry quarter of the Earth bereav&#8217;d, <br />
Delos, the floating isle, at length receiv&#8217;d. <br />
Who there, in spite of enemies, brought forth, <br />
Beneath an olive&#8217;s shade, her great twin-birth.</p>
<p>Hence too she fled the furious stepdame&#8217;s pow&#8217;r, <br />
And in her arms a double godhead bore; <br />
And now the borders of fair Lycia gain&#8217;d, <br />
Just when the summer solstice parch&#8217;d the land. <br />
With thirst the Goddess languishing, no more <br />
Her empty&#8217;d breast would yield its milky store; <br />
When, from below, the smiling valley show&#8217;d <br />
A silver lake that in its bottom flow&#8217;d: <br />
A sort of clowns were reaping, near the bank, <br />
The bending osier, and the bullrush dank; <br />
The cresse, and water-lilly, fragrant weed, <br />
Whose juicy stalk the liquid fountains feed. <br />
The Goddess came, and kneeling on the brink, <br />
Stoop&#8217;d at the fresh repast, prepar&#8217;d to drink. <br />
Then thus, being hinder&#8217;d by the rabble race, <br />
In accents mild expostulates the case. <br />
Water I only ask, and sure &#8217;tis hard <br />
From Nature&#8217;s common rights to be debar&#8217;d: <br />
This, as the genial sun, and vital air, <br />
Should flow alike to ev&#8217;ry creature&#8217;s share. <br />
Yet still I ask, and as a favour crave, <br />
That which, a publick bounty, Nature gave. <br />
Nor do I seek my weary limbs to drench; <br />
Only, with one cool draught, my thirst I&#8217;d quench. <br />
Now from my throat the usual moisture dries, <br />
And ev&#8217;n my voice in broken accents dies: <br />
One draught as dear as life I should esteem, <br />
And water, now I thirst, would nectar seem. <br />
Oh! let my little babes your pity move, <br />
And melt your hearts to charitable love; <br />
They (as by chance they did) extend to you <br />
Their little hands, and my request pursue.</p>
<p>Whom would these soft perswasions not subdue, <br />
Tho&#8217; the most rustick, and unmanner&#8217;d crew? <br />
Yet they the Goddess&#8217;s request refuse, <br />
And with rude words reproachfully abuse: <br />
Nay more, with spiteful feet the villains trod <br />
O&#8217;er the soft bottom of the marshy flood, <br />
And blacken&#8217;d all the lake with clouds of rising mud.</p>
<p>Her thirst by indignation was suppress&#8217;d; <br />
Bent on revenge, the Goddess stood confess&#8217;d. <br />
Her suppliant hands uplifting to the skies, <br />
For a redress, to Heav&#8217;n she now applies. <br />
And, May you live, she passionately cry&#8217;d, <br />
Doom&#8217;d in that pool for ever to abide.</p>
<p>The Goddess has her wish; for now they chuse <br />
To plunge, and dive among the watry ooze; <br />
Sometimes they shew their head above the brim, <br />
And on the glassy surface spread to swim; <br />
Often upon the bank their station take, <br />
Then spring, and leap into the cooly lake. <br />
Still, void of shame, they lead a clam&#8217;rous life, <br />
And, croaking, still scold on in endless strife; <br />
Compell&#8217;d to live beneath the liquid stream, <br />
Where still they quarrel, and attempt to skream. <br />
Now, from their bloated throat, their voice puts on <br />
Imperfect murmurs in a hoarser tone; <br />
Their noisy jaws, with bawling now grown wide, <br />
An ugly sight! extend on either side: <br />
Their motly back, streak&#8217;d with a list of green, <br />
Joyn&#8217;d to their head, without a neck is seen; <br />
And, with a belly broad and white, they look <br />
Meer frogs, and still frequent the muddy brook.</p>
<p>The Fate of Marsyas</p>
<p>Scarce had the man this famous story told, <br />
Of vengeance on the Lycians shown of old, <br />
When strait another pictures to their view <br />
The Satyr&#8217;s fate, whom angry Phoebus slew; <br />
Who, rais&#8217;d with high conceit, and puff&#8217;d with pride, <br />
At his own pipe the skilful God defy&#8217;d. <br />
Why do you tear me from my self, he cries? <br />
Ah cruel! must my skin be made the prize? <br />
This for a silly pipe? he roaring said, <br />
Mean-while the skin from off his limbs was flay&#8217;d. <br />
All bare, and raw, one large continu&#8217;d wound, <br />
With streams of blood his body bath&#8217;d the ground. <br />
The blueish veins their trembling pulse disclos&#8217;d, <br />
The stringy nerves lay naked, and expos&#8217;d; <br />
His guts appear&#8217;d, distinctly each express&#8217;d, <br />
With ev&#8217;ry shining fibre of his breast.</p>
<p>The Fauns, and Silvans, with the Nymphs that rove <br />
Among the Satyrs in the shady grove; <br />
Olympus, known of old, and ev&#8217;ry swain <br />
That fed, or flock, or herd upon the plain, <br />
Bewail&#8217;d the loss; and with their tears that flow&#8217;d, <br />
A kindly moisture on the earth bestow&#8217;d; <br />
That soon, conjoyn&#8217;d, and in a body rang&#8217;d, <br />
Sprung from the ground, to limpid water chang&#8217;d; <br />
Which, down thro&#8217; Phrygia&#8217;s rocks, a mighty stream, <br />
Comes tumbling to the sea, and Marsya is its name.</p>
<p>The Story of Pelops</p>
<p>From these relations strait the people turn <br />
To present truths, and lost Amphion mourn: <br />
The mother most was blam&#8217;d, yet some relate <br />
That Pelops pity&#8217;d, and bewail&#8217;d her fate, <br />
And stript his cloaths, and laid his shoulder bare, <br />
And made the iv&#8217;ry miracle appear. <br />
This shoulder, from the first, was form&#8217;d of flesh, <br />
As lively as the other, and as fresh; <br />
But, when the youth was by his father slain, <br />
The Gods restor&#8217;d his mangled limbs again; <br />
Only that place which joins the neck and arm, <br />
The rest untouch&#8217;d, was found to suffer harm: <br />
The loss of which an iv&#8217;ry piece sustain&#8217;d; <br />
And thus the youth his limbs, and life regain&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The Story of Tereus, Procne, and Philomela</p>
<p>To Thebes the neighb&#8217;ring princes all repair, <br />
And with condolance the misfortune share. <br />
Each bord&#8217;ring state in solemn form address&#8217;d, <br />
And each betimes a friendly grief express&#8217;d. <br />
Argos, with Sparta&#8217;s, and Mycenae&#8217;s towns, <br />
And Calydon, yet free from fierce Diana&#8217;s frowns. <br />
Corinth for finest brass well fam&#8217;d of old, <br />
Orthomenos for men of courage bold: <br />
Cleonae lying in the lowly dale, <br />
And rich Messene with its fertile vale: <br />
Pylos, for Nestor&#8217;s City after fam&#8217;d, <br />
And Troezen, not as yet from Pittheus nam&#8217;d. <br />
And those fair cities, which are hem&#8217;d around <br />
By double seas within the Isthmian ground; <br />
And those, which farther from the sea-coast stand, <br />
Lodg&#8217;d in the bosom of the spacious land.</p>
<p>Who can believe it? Athens was the last: <br />
Tho&#8217; for politeness fam&#8217;d for ages past. <br />
For a strait siege, which then their walls enclos&#8217;d, <br />
Such acts of kind humanity oppos&#8217;d: <br />
And thick with ships, from foreign nations bound, <br />
Sea-ward their city lay invested round.</p>
<p>These, with auxiliar forces led from far, <br />
Tereus of Thrace, brave, and inur&#8217;d to war, <br />
Had quite defeated, and obtain&#8217;d a name, <br />
The warrior&#8217;s due, among the sons of Fame. <br />
This, with his wealth, and pow&#8217;r, and ancient line, <br />
From Mars deriv&#8217;d, Pandions&#8217;s thoughts incline <br />
His daughter Procne with the prince to joyn.</p>
<p>Nor Hymen, nor the Graces here preside, <br />
Nor Juno to befriend the blooming bride; <br />
But Fiends with fun&#8217;ral brands the process led, <br />
And Furies waited at the Genial bed: <br />
And all night long the scrieching owl aloof, <br />
With baleful notes, sate brooding o&#8217;er the roof. <br />
With such ill Omens was the match begun, <br />
That made them parents of a hopeful son. <br />
Now Thrace congratulates their seeming joy, <br />
And they, in thankful rites, their minds employ. <br />
If the fair queen&#8217;s espousals pleas&#8217;d before, <br />
Itys, the new-born prince, now pleases more; <br />
And each bright day, the birth, and bridal feast, <br />
Were kept with hallow&#8217;d pomp above the rest. <br />
So far true happiness may lye conceal&#8217;d, <br />
When, by false lights, we fancy &#8217;tis reveal&#8217;d!</p>
<p>Now, since their nuptials, had the golden sun <br />
Five courses round his ample zodiac run; <br />
When gentle Procne thus her lord address&#8217;d, <br />
And spoke the secret wishes of her breast: <br />
If I, she said, have ever favour found, <br />
Let my petition with success be crown&#8217;d: <br />
Let me at Athens my dear sister see, <br />
Or let her come to Thrace, and visit me. <br />
And, lest my father should her absence mourn, <br />
Promise that she shall make a quick return. <br />
With thanks I&#8217;d own the obligation due <br />
Only, o Tereus, to the Gods, and you.</p>
<p>Now, ply&#8217;d with oar, and sail at his command, <br />
The nimble gallies reach&#8217;d th&#8217; Athenian land, <br />
And anchor&#8217;d in the fam&#8217;d Piraean bay, <br />
While Tereus to the palace takes his way; <br />
The king salutes, and ceremonies past, <br />
Begins the fatal embassy at last; <br />
The occasion of his voyage he declares, <br />
And, with his own, his wife&#8217;s request prefers: <br />
Asks leave that, only for a little space, <br />
Their lovely sister might embark for Thrace.</p>
<p>Thus while he spoke, appear&#8217;d the royal maid, <br />
Bright Philomela, splendidly array&#8217;d; <br />
But most attractive in her charming face, <br />
And comely person, turn&#8217;d with ev&#8217;ry grace: <br />
Like those fair Nymphs, that are describ&#8217;d to rove <br />
Across the glades, and op&#8217;nings of the grove; <br />
Only that these are dress&#8217;d for silvan sports, <br />
And less become the finery of courts.</p>
<p>Tereus beheld the virgin, and admir&#8217;d, <br />
And with the coals of burning lust was fir&#8217;d: <br />
Like crackling stubble, or the summer hay, <br />
When forked lightnings o&#8217;er the meadows play. <br />
Such charms in any breast might kindle love, <br />
But him the heats of inbred lewdness move; <br />
To which, tho&#8217; Thrace is naturally prone, <br />
Yet his is still superior, and his own. <br />
Strait her attendants he designs to buy, <br />
And with large bribes her governess would try: <br />
Herself with ample gifts resolves to bend, <br />
And his whole kingdom in th&#8217; attempt expend: <br />
Or, snatch&#8217;d away by force of arms, to bear, <br />
And justify the rape with open war. <br />
The boundless passion boils within his breast, <br />
And his projecting soul admits no rest.</p>
<p>And now, impatient of the least delay, <br />
By pleading Procne&#8217;s cause, he speeds his way: <br />
The eloquence of love his tongue inspires, <br />
And, in his wife&#8217;s, he speaks his own desires; <br />
Hence all his importunities arise, <br />
And tears unmanly trickle from his eyes.</p>
<p>Ye Gods! what thick involving darkness blinds <br />
The stupid faculties of mortal minds! <br />
Tereus the credit of good-nature gains <br />
From these his crimes; so well the villain feigns. <br />
And, unsuspecting of his base designs, <br />
In the request fair Philomela joyns; <br />
Her snowy arms her aged sire embrace, <br />
And clasp his neck with an endearing grace: <br />
Only to see her sister she entreats, <br />
A seeming blessing, which a curse compleats. <br />
Tereus surveys her with a luscious eye, <br />
And in his mind forestalls the blissful joy: <br />
Her circling arms a scene of lust inspire, <br />
And ev&#8217;ry kiss foments the raging fire. <br />
Fondly he wishes for the father&#8217;s place, <br />
To feel, and to return the warm embrace; <br />
Since not the nearest ties of filial blood <br />
Would damp his flame, and force him to be good.</p>
<p>At length, for both their sakes, the king agrees; <br />
And Philomela, on her bended knees, <br />
Thanks him for what her fancy calls success, <br />
When cruel fate intends her nothing less.</p>
<p>Now Phoebus, hastning to ambrosial rest, <br />
His fiery steeds drove sloping down the west: <br />
The sculptur&#8217;d gold with sparkling wines was fill&#8217;d, <br />
And, with rich meats, each chearful table smil&#8217;d. <br />
Plenty, and mirth the royal banquet close, <br />
Then all retire to sleep, and sweet repose. <br />
But the lewd monarch, tho&#8217; withdrawn apart, <br />
Still feels love&#8217;s poison rankling in his heart: <br />
Her face divine is stamp&#8217;d within his breast, <br />
Fancy imagines, and improves the rest: <br />
And thus, kept waking by intense desire, <br />
He nourishes his own prevailing fire.</p>
<p>Next day the good old king for Tereus sends, <br />
And to his charge the virgin recommends; <br />
His hand with tears th&#8217; indulgent father press&#8217;d, <br />
Then spoke, and thus with tenderness address&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Since the kind instances of pious love, <br />
Do all pretence of obstacle remove; <br />
Since Procne&#8217;s, and her own, with your request, <br />
O&#8217;er-rule the fears of a paternal breast; <br />
With you, dear son, my daughter I entrust, <br />
And by the Gods adjure you to be just; <br />
By truth, and ev&#8217;ry consanguineal tye, <br />
To watch, and guard her with a father&#8217;s eye. <br />
And, since the least delay will tedious prove, <br />
In keeping from my sight the child I love, <br />
With speed return her, kindly to asswage <br />
The tedious troubles of my lingring age. <br />
And you, my Philomel, let it suffice, <br />
To know your sister&#8217;s banish&#8217;d from my eyes; <br />
If any sense of duty sways your mind, <br />
Let me from you the shortest absence find. <br />
He wept; then kiss&#8217;d his child; and while he speaks, <br />
The tears fall gently down his aged cheeks. <br />
Next, as a pledge of fealty, he demands, <br />
And, with a solemn charge, conjoyns their hands; <br />
Then to his daughter, and his grandson sends, <br />
And by their mouth a blessing recommends; <br />
While, in a voice with dire forebodings broke, <br />
Sobbing, and faint, the last farewel was spoke.</p>
<p>Now Philomela, scarce receiv&#8217;d on board, <br />
And in the royal gilded bark secur&#8217;d, <br />
Beheld the dashes of the bending oar, <br />
The ruffled sea, and the receding shore; <br />
When strait (his joy impatient of disguise) <br />
We&#8217;ve gain&#8217;d our point, the rough Barbarian cries; <br />
Now I possess the dear, the blissful hour, <br />
And ev&#8217;ry wish subjected to my pow&#8217;r. <br />
Transports of lust his vicious thoughts employ, <br />
And he forbears, with pain, th&#8217; expected joy. <br />
His gloting eyes incessantly survey&#8217;d <br />
The virgin beauties of the lovely maid: <br />
As when the bold rapacious bird of Jove, <br />
With crooked talons stooping from above, <br />
Has snatcht, and carry&#8217;d to his lofty nest <br />
A captive hare, with cruel gripes opprest; <br />
Secure, with fix&#8217;d, and unrelenting eyes, <br />
He sits, and views the helpless, trembling prize.</p>
<p>Their vessels now had made th&#8217; intended land, <br />
And all with joy descend upon the strand; <br />
When the false tyrant seiz&#8217;d the princely maid, <br />
And to a lodge in distant woods convey&#8217;d; <br />
Pale, sinking, and distress&#8217;d with jealous fears, <br />
And asking for her sister all in tears. <br />
The letcher, for enjoyment fully bent, <br />
No longer now conceal&#8217;d his base intent; <br />
But with rude haste the bloomy girl deflow&#8217;r&#8217;d, <br />
Tender, defenceless, and with ease o&#8217;erpower&#8217;d. <br />
Her piercing accents to her sire complain, <br />
And to her absent sister, but in vain: <br />
In vain she importunes, with doleful cries, <br />
Each unattentive godhead of the skies. <br />
She pants and trembles, like the bleating prey, <br />
From some close-hunted wolf just snatch&#8217;d away; <br />
That still, with fearful horror, looks around, <br />
And on its flank regards the bleeding wound. <br />
Or, as the tim&#8217;rous dove, the danger o&#8217;er, <br />
Beholds her shining plumes besmear&#8217;d with gore, <br />
And, tho&#8217; deliver&#8217;d from the faulcon&#8217;s claw, <br />
Yet shivers, and retains a secret awe.</p>
<p>But when her mind a calm reflection shar&#8217;d, <br />
And all her scatter&#8217;d spirits were repair&#8217;d: <br />
Torn, and disorder&#8217;d while her tresses hung, <br />
Her livid hands, like one that mourn&#8217;d, she wrung; <br />
Then thus, with grief o&#8217;erwhelm&#8217;d her languid eyes, <br />
Savage, inhumane, cruel wretch! she cries; <br />
Whom not a parent&#8217;s strict commands could move, <br />
Tho&#8217; charg&#8217;d, and utter&#8217;d with the tears of love; <br />
Nor virgin innocence, nor all that&#8217;s due <br />
To the strong contract of the nuptial vow: <br />
Virtue, by this, in wild confusion&#8217;s laid, <br />
And I compell&#8217;d to wrong my sister&#8217;s bed; <br />
Whilst you, regardless of your marriage oath, <br />
With stains of incest have defil&#8217;d us both. <br />
Tho&#8217; I deserv&#8217;d some punishment to find, <br />
This was, ye Gods! too cruel, and unkind. <br />
Yet, villain, to compleat your horrid guilt, <br />
Stab here, and let my tainted blood be spilt. <br />
Oh happy! had it come, before I knew <br />
The curs&#8217;d embrace of vile perfidious you; <br />
Then my pale ghost, pure from incestuous love, <br />
Had wander&#8217;d spotless thro&#8217; th&#8217; Elysian grove. <br />
But, if the Gods above have pow&#8217;r to know, <br />
And judge those actions that are done below; <br />
Unless the dreaded thunders of the sky, <br />
Like me, subdu&#8217;d, and violated lye; <br />
Still my revenge shall take its proper time, <br />
And suit the baseness of your hellish crime. <br />
My self, abandon&#8217;d, and devoid of shame, <br />
Thro&#8217; the wide world your actions will proclaim; <br />
Or tho&#8217; I&#8217;m prison&#8217;d in this lonely den, <br />
Obscur&#8217;d, and bury&#8217;d from the sight of men, <br />
My mournful voice the pitying rocks shall move, <br />
And my complainings eccho thro&#8217; the grove. <br />
Hear me, o Heav&#8217;n! and, if a God be there, <br />
Let him regard me, and accept my pray&#8217;r.</p>
<p>Struck with these words, the tyrant&#8217;s guilty breast <br />
With fear, and anger, was, by turns, possest; <br />
Now, with remorse his conscience deeply stung, <br />
He drew the faulchion that beside her hung, <br />
And first her tender arms behind her bound, <br />
Then drag&#8217;d her by the hair along the ground. <br />
The princess willingly her throat reclin&#8217;d, <br />
And view&#8217;d the steel with a contented mind; <br />
But soon her tongue the girding pinchers strain, <br />
With anguish, soon she feels the piercing pain: <br />
Oh father! father! would fain have spoke, <br />
But the sharp torture her intention broke; <br />
In vain she tries, for now the blade has cut <br />
Her tongue sheer off, close to the trembling root. <br />
The mangled part still quiver&#8217;d on the ground, <br />
Murmuring with a faint imperfect sound: <br />
And, as a serpent writhes his wounded train, <br />
Uneasy, panting, and possess&#8217;d with pain; <br />
The piece, while life remain&#8217;d, still trembled fast, <br />
And to its mistress pointed to the last.</p>
<p>Yet, after this so damn&#8217;d, and black a deed, <br />
Fame (which I scarce can credit) has agreed, <br />
That on her rifled charms, still void of shame, <br />
He frequently indulg&#8217;d his lustful flame, <br />
At last he ventures to his Procne&#8217;s sight, <br />
Loaded with guilt, and cloy&#8217;d with long delight; <br />
There, with feign&#8217;d grief, and false, dissembled sighs, <br />
Begins a formal narrative of lies; <br />
Her sister&#8217;s death he artfully declares, <br />
Then weeps, and raises credit from his tears. <br />
Her vest, with flow&#8217;rs of gold embroider&#8217;d o&#8217;er, <br />
With grief distress&#8217;d, the mournful matron tore, <br />
And a beseeming suit of gloomy sable wore. <br />
With cost, an honorary tomb she rais&#8217;d, <br />
And thus th&#8217; imaginary ghost appeas&#8217;d. <br />
Deluded queen! the fate of her you love, <br />
Nor grief, nor pity, but revenge should move.</p>
<p>Thro&#8217; the twelve signs had pass&#8217;d the circling sun, <br />
And round the compass of the Zodiac run; <br />
What must unhappy Philomela do, <br />
For ever subject to her keeper&#8217;s view? <br />
Huge walls of massy stone the lodge surround, <br />
From her own mouth no way of speaking&#8217;s found. <br />
But all our wants by wit may be supply&#8217;d, <br />
And art makes up, what fortune has deny&#8217;d: <br />
With skill exact a Phrygian web she strung, <br />
Fix&#8217;d to a loom that in her chamber hung, <br />
Where in-wrought letters, upon white display&#8217;d, <br />
In purple notes, her wretched case betray&#8217;d: <br />
The piece, when finish&#8217;d, secretly she gave <br />
Into the charge of one poor menial slave; <br />
And then, with gestures, made him understand, <br />
It must be safe convey&#8217;d to Procne&#8217;s hand. <br />
The slave, with speed, the queen&#8217;s apartment sought, <br />
And render&#8217;d up his charge, unknowing what he brought. <br />
But when the cyphers, figur&#8217;d in each fold, <br />
Her sister&#8217;s melancholy story told <br />
(Strange that she could!) with silence, she survey&#8217;d <br />
The tragick piece, and without weeping read: <br />
In such tumultuous haste her passions sprung, <br />
They choak&#8217;d her voice, and quite disarm&#8217;d her tongue. <br />
No room for female tears; the Furies rise, <br />
Darting vindictive glances from her eyes; <br />
And, stung with rage, she bounds from place to place, <br />
While stern revenge sits low&#8217;ring in her face.</p>
<p>Now the triennial celebration came, <br />
Observ&#8217;d to Bacchus by each Thracian dame; <br />
When, in the privacies of night retir&#8217;d, <br />
They act his rites, with sacred rapture fir&#8217;d: <br />
By night, the tinkling cymbals ring around, <br />
While the shrill notes from Rhodope resound; <br />
By night, the queen, disguis&#8217;d, forsakes the court, <br />
To mingle in the festival resort. <br />
Leaves of the curling vine her temples shade, <br />
And, with a circling wreath, adorn her head: <br />
Adown her back the stag&#8217;s rough spoils appear, <br />
Light on her shoulder leans a cornel spear.</p>
<p>Thus, in the fury of the God conceal&#8217;d, <br />
Procne her own mad headstrong passion veil&#8217;d; <br />
Now, with her gang, to the thick wood she flies, <br />
And with religious yellings fills the skies; <br />
The fatal lodge, as &#8217;twere by chance, she seeks, <br />
And, thro&#8217; the bolted doors, an entrance breaks; <br />
From thence, her sister snatching by the hand, <br />
Mask&#8217;d like the ranting Bacchanalian band, <br />
Within the limits of the court she drew, <br />
Shading, with ivy green, her outward hue. <br />
But Philomela, conscious of the place, <br />
Felt new reviving pangs of her disgrace; <br />
A shiv&#8217;ring cold prevail&#8217;d in ev&#8217;ry part, <br />
And the chill&#8217;d blood ran trembling to her heart.</p>
<p>Soon as the queen a fit retirement found, <br />
Stript of the garlands that her temples crown&#8217;d, <br />
She strait unveil&#8217;d her blushing sister&#8217;s face, <br />
And fondly clasp&#8217;d her with a close embrace: <br />
But, in confusion lost, th&#8217; unhappy maid, <br />
With shame dejected, hung her drooping head, <br />
As guilty of a crime that stain&#8217;d her sister&#8217;s bed. <br />
That speech, that should her injur&#8217;d virtue clear, <br />
And make her spotless innocence appear, <br />
Is now no more; only her hands, and eyes <br />
Appeal, in signals, to the conscious skies. <br />
In Procne&#8217;s breast the rising passions boil, <br />
And burst in anger with a mad recoil; <br />
Her sister&#8217;s ill-tim&#8217;d grief, with scorn, she blames, <br />
Then, in these furious words her rage proclaims.</p>
<p>Tears, unavailing, but defer our time, <br />
The stabbing sword must expiate the crime; <br />
Or worse, if wit, on bloody vengeance bent, <br />
A weapon more tormenting can invent. <br />
O sister! I&#8217;ve prepar&#8217;d my stubborn heart, <br />
To act some hellish, and unheard-of part; <br />
Either the palace to surround with fire, <br />
And see the villain in the flames expire; <br />
Or, with a knife, dig out his cursed eyes, <br />
Or, his false tongue with racking engines seize; <br />
Or, cut away the part that injur&#8217;d you, <br />
And, thro&#8217; a thousand wounds, his guilty soul pursue. <br />
Tortures enough my passion has design&#8217;d, <br />
But the variety distracts my mind.</p>
<p>A-while, thus wav&#8217;ring, stood the furious dame, <br />
When Itys fondling to his mother came; <br />
From him the cruel fatal hint she took, <br />
She view&#8217;d him with a stern remorseless look: <br />
Ah! but too like thy wicked sire, she said, <br />
Forming the direful purpose in her head. <br />
At this a sullen grief her voice supprest, <br />
While silent passions struggle in her breast.</p>
<p>Now, at her lap arriv&#8217;d, the flatt&#8217;ring boy <br />
Salutes his parent with a smiling joy: <br />
About her neck his little arms are thrown, <br />
And he accosts her in a pratling tone. <br />
Then her tempestuous anger was allay&#8217;d, <br />
And in its full career her vengeance stay&#8217;d; <br />
While tender thoughts, in spite of passion, rise, <br />
And melting tears disarm her threat&#8217;ning eyes. <br />
But when she found the mother&#8217;s easy heart, <br />
Too fondly swerving from th&#8217; intended part; <br />
Her injur&#8217;d sister&#8217;s face again she view&#8217;d: <br />
And, as by turns surveying both she stood, <br />
While this fond boy (she said) can thus express <br />
The moving accents of his fond address; <br />
Why stands my sister of her tongue bereft, <br />
Forlorn, and sad, in speechless silence left? <br />
O Procne, see the fortune of your house! <br />
Such is your fate, when match&#8217;d to such a spouse! <br />
Conjugal duty, if observ&#8217;d to him, <br />
Would change from virtue, and become a crime; <br />
For all respect to Tereus must debase <br />
The noble blood of great Pandion&#8217;s race.</p>
<p>Strait at these words, with big resentment fill&#8217;d, <br />
Furious her look, she flew, and seiz&#8217;d her child; <br />
Like a fell tigress of the savage kind, <br />
That drags the tender suckling of the hind <br />
Thro&#8217; India&#8217;s gloomy groves, where Ganges laves <br />
The shady scene, and rouls his streamy waves.</p>
<p>Now to a close apartment they were come, <br />
Far off retir&#8217;d within the spacious dome; <br />
When Procne, on revengeful mischief bent, <br />
Home to his heart a piercing ponyard sent. <br />
Itys, with rueful cries, but all too late, <br />
Holds out his hands, and deprecates his fate; <br />
Still at his mother&#8217;s neck he fondly aims, <br />
And strives to melt her with endearing names; <br />
Yet still the cruel mother perseveres, <br />
Nor with concern his bitter anguish hears. <br />
This might suffice; but Philomela too <br />
Across his throat a shining curtlass drew. <br />
Then both, with knives, dissect each quiv&#8217;ring part, <br />
And carve the butcher&#8217;d limbs with cruel art; <br />
Which, whelm&#8217;d in boiling cauldrons o&#8217;er the fire, <br />
Or turn&#8217;d on spits, in steamy smoak aspire: <br />
While the long entries, with their slipp&#8217;ry floor, <br />
Run down in purple streams of clotted gore.</p>
<p>Ask&#8217;d by his wife to this inhuman feast, <br />
Tereus unknowingly is made a guest: <br />
Whilst she her plot the better to disguise, <br />
Styles it some unknown mystick sacrifice; <br />
And such the nature of the hallow&#8217;d rite, <br />
The wife her husband only could invite, <br />
The slaves must all withdraw, and be debarr&#8217;d the sight. <br />
Tereus, upon a throne of antique state, <br />
Loftily rais&#8217;d, before the banquet sate; <br />
And glutton like, luxuriously pleas&#8217;d, <br />
With his own flesh his hungry maw appeas&#8217;d. <br />
Nay, such a blindness o&#8217;er his senses falls, <br />
That he for Itys to the table calls. <br />
When Procne, now impatient to disclose <br />
The joy that from her full revenge arose, <br />
Cries out, in transports of a cruel mind, <br />
Within your self your Itys you may find. <br />
Still, at this puzzling answer, with surprise, <br />
Around the room he sends his curious eyes; <br />
And, as he still inquir&#8217;d, and call&#8217;d aloud, <br />
Fierce Philomela, all besmear&#8217;d with blood, <br />
Her hands with murder stain&#8217;d, her spreading hair <br />
Hanging dishevel&#8217;d with a ghastly air, <br />
Stept forth, and flung full in the tyrant&#8217;s face <br />
The head of Itys, goary as it was: <br />
Nor ever so much to use her tongue, <br />
And with a just reproach to vindicate her wrong.</p>
<p>The Thracian monarch from the table flings, <br />
While with his cries the vaulted parlour rings; <br />
His imprecations eccho down to Hell, <br />
And rouze the snaky Furies from their Stygian cell. <br />
One while he labours to disgorge his breast, <br />
And free his stomach from the cursed feast; <br />
Then, weeping o&#8217;er his lamentable doom, <br />
He styles himself his son&#8217;s sepulchral tomb. <br />
Now, with drawn sabre, and impetuous speed, <br />
In close pursuit he drives Pandion&#8217;s breed; <br />
Whose nimble feet spring with so swift a force <br />
Across the fields, they seem to wing their course. <br />
And now, on real wings themselves they raise, <br />
And steer their airy flight by diff&#8217;rent ways; <br />
One to the woodland&#8217;s shady covert hies, <br />
Around the smoaky roof the other flies; <br />
Whose feathers yet the marks of murder stain, <br />
Where stampt upon her breast, the crimson spots remain. <br />
Tereus, through grief, and haste to be reveng&#8217;d, <br />
Shares the like fate, and to a bird is chang&#8217;d: <br />
Fix&#8217;d on his head, the crested plumes appear, <br />
Long is his beak, and sharpen&#8217;d like a spear; <br />
Thus arm&#8217;d, his looks his inward mind display, <br />
And, to a lapwing turn&#8217;d, he fans his way. <br />
Exceeding trouble, for his children&#8217;s fate, <br />
Shorten&#8217;d Pandion&#8217;s days, and chang&#8217;d his date; <br />
Down to the shades below, with sorrow spent, <br />
An earlier, unexpected ghost he went.</p>
<p>Boreas in Love</p>
<p>Erechtheus next th&#8217; Athenian sceptre sway&#8217;d, <br />
Whose rule the state with joynt consent obey&#8217;d; <br />
So mix&#8217;d his justice with his valour flow&#8217;d, <br />
His reign one scene of princely goodness shew&#8217;d. <br />
Four hopeful youths, as many females bright, <br />
Sprung from his loyns, and sooth&#8217;d him with delight.</p>
<p>Two of these sisters, of a lovelier air, <br />
Excell&#8217;d the rest, tho&#8217; all the rest were fair. <br />
Procris, to Cephalus in wedlock ty&#8217;d, <br />
Bless&#8217;d the young silvan with a blooming bride: <br />
For Orithyia Boreas suffer&#8217;d pain, <br />
For the coy maid sued long, but sued in vain; <br />
Tereus his neighbour, and his Thracian blood, <br />
Against the match a main objection stood; <br />
Which made his vows, and all his suppliant love, <br />
Empty as air and ineffectual prove.</p>
<p>But when he found his soothing flatt&#8217;ries fail, <br />
Nor saw his soft addresses cou&#8217;d avail; <br />
Blust&#8217;ring with ire, he quickly has recourse <br />
To rougher arts, and his own native force. <br />
&#8216;Tis well, he said; such usage is my due, <br />
When thus disguis&#8217;d by foreign ways I sue; <br />
When my stern airs, and fierceness I disclaim, <br />
And sigh for love, ridiculously tame; <br />
When soft addresses foolishly I try, <br />
Nor my own stronger remedies apply. <br />
By force and violence I chiefly live, <br />
By them the lowring stormy tempests drive; <br />
In foaming billows raise the hoary deep, <br />
Writhe knotted oaks, and sandy desarts sweep; <br />
Congeal the falling flakes of fleecy snow, <br />
And bruise, with ratling hall, the plains below. <br />
I, and my brother-winds, when joyn&#8217;d above, <br />
Thro&#8217; the waste champian of the skies we rove, <br />
With such a boist&#8217;rous full career engage, <br />
That Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s whole concave thunders at our rage. <br />
While, struck from nitrous clouds, fierce lightnings play, <br />
Dart thro&#8217; the storm, and gild the gloomy day. <br />
Or when, in subterraneous caverns pent, <br />
My breath, against the hollow Earth, is bent, <br />
The quaking world above, and ghosts below, <br />
My mighty pow&#8217;r, by dear experience, know, <br />
Tremble with fear, and dread the fatal blow. <br />
This is the only cure to be apply&#8217;d, <br />
Thus to Erechtheus I should be ally&#8217;d; <br />
And thus the scornful virgin should be woo&#8217;d, <br />
Not by intreaty, but by force subdu&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Boreas, in passion, spoke these huffing things, <br />
And, as he spoke, he shook his dreadful wings; <br />
At which, afar the shiv&#8217;ring sea was fan&#8217;d, <br />
And the wide surface of the distant land: <br />
His dusty mantle o&#8217;er the hills he drew, <br />
And swept the lowly vallies, as he flew; <br />
Then, with his yellow wings, embrac&#8217;d the maid, <br />
And, wrapt in dusky clouds, far off convey&#8217;d. <br />
The sparkling blaze of Love&#8217;s prevailing fire <br />
Shone brighter as he flew, and flam&#8217;d the higher. <br />
And now the God, possess&#8217;d of his delight, <br />
To northern Thrace pursu&#8217;d his airy flight, <br />
Where the young ravish&#8217;d nymph became his bride, <br />
And soon the luscious sweets of wedlock try&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Two lovely twins, th&#8217; effect of this embrace, <br />
Crown their soft labours, and their nuptials grace; <br />
Who, like their mother, beautiful, and fair, <br />
Their father&#8217;s strength, and feather&#8217;d pinions share: <br />
Yet these, at first, were wanting, as &#8217;tis said, <br />
And after, as they grew, their shoulders spread. <br />
Zethes and Calais, the pretty twins, <br />
Remain&#8217;d unfledg&#8217;d, while smooth their beardless chins; <br />
But when, in time, the budding silver down <br />
Shaded their face, and on their cheeks was grown, <br />
Two sprouting wings upon their shoulders sprung, <br />
Like those in birds, that veil the callow young. <br />
Then as their age advanc&#8217;d, and they began <br />
From greener youth to ripen into man, <br />
With Jason&#8217;s Argonauts they cross&#8217;d the seas, <br />
Embark&#8217;d in quest of the fam&#8217;d golden fleece; <br />
There, with the rest, the first frail vessel try&#8217;d, <br />
And boldly ventur&#8217;d on the swelling tide. </p>
