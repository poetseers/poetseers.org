				<p>The Story of Phaeton</p>
<p>The Sun&#8217;s bright palace, on high columns rais&#8217;d, <br />
With burnish&#8217;d gold and flaming jewels blaz&#8217;d; <br />
The folding gates diffus&#8217;d a silver light, <br />
And with a milder gleam refresh&#8217;d the sight; <br />
Of polish&#8217;d iv&#8217;ry was the cov&#8217;ring wrought: <br />
The matter vied not with the sculptor&#8217;s thought, <br />
For in the portal was display&#8217;d on high <br />
(The work of Vulcan) a fictitious sky; <br />
A waving sea th&#8217; inferiour Earth embrac&#8217;d, <br />
And Gods and Goddesses the waters grac&#8217;d. <br />
Aegeon here a mighty whale bestrode; <br />
Triton, and Proteus (the deceiving God) <br />
With Doris here were carv&#8217;d, and all her train, <br />
Some loosely swimming in the figur&#8217;d main, <br />
While some on rocks their dropping hair divide, <br />
And some on fishes through the waters glide: <br />
Tho&#8217; various features did the sisters grace, <br />
A sister&#8217;s likeness was in ev&#8217;ry face. <br />
On Earth a diff&#8217;rent landskip courts the eyes, <br />
Men, towns, and beasts in distant prospects rise, <br />
And nymphs, and streams, and woods, and rural deities. <br />
O&#8217;er all, the Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s refulgent image shines; <br />
On either gate were six engraven signs.</p>
<p>Here Phaeton still gaining on th&#8217; ascent, <br />
To his suspected father&#8217;s palace went, <br />
&#8216;Till pressing forward through the bright abode, <br />
He saw at distance the illustrious God: <br />
He saw at distance, or the dazling light <br />
Had flash&#8217;d too strongly on his aking sight.</p>
<p>The God sits high, exalted on a throne <br />
Of blazing gems, with purple garments on; <br />
The Hours, in order rang&#8217;d on either hand, <br />
And Days, and Months, and Years, and Ages stand. <br />
Here Spring appears with flow&#8217;ry chaplets bound; <br />
Here Summer in her wheaten garland crown&#8217;d; <br />
Here Autumn the rich trodden grapes besmear; <br />
And hoary Winter shivers in the reer.</p>
<p>Phoebus beheld the youth from off his throne; <br />
That eye, which looks on all, was fix&#8217;d in one. <br />
He saw the boy&#8217;s confusion in his face, <br />
Surpriz&#8217;d at all the wonders of the place; <br />
And cries aloud, &#8220;What wants my son? for know <br />
My son thou art, and I must call thee so.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Light of the world,&#8221; the trembling youth replies, <br />
&#8220;Illustrious parent! since you don&#8217;t despise <br />
The parent&#8217;s name, some certain token give, <br />
That I may Clymene&#8217;s proud boast believe, <br />
Nor longer under false reproaches grieve.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tender sire was touch&#8217;d with what he said, <br />
And flung the blaze of glories from his head, <br />
And bid the youth advance: &#8220;My son,&#8221; said he, <br />
&#8220;Come to thy father&#8217;s arms! for Clymene <br />
Has told thee true; a parent&#8217;s name I own, <br />
And deem thee worthy to be called my son. <br />
As a sure proof, make some request, and I, <br />
Whate&#8217;er it be, with that request comply; <br />
By Styx I swear, whose waves are hid in night, <br />
And roul impervious to my piercing sight.&#8221; <br />
The youth transported, asks, without delay, <br />
To guide the sun&#8217;s bright chariot for a day.</p>
<p>The God repented of the oath he took, <br />
For anguish thrice his radiant head he shook; <br />
&#8220;My son,&#8221; says he, &#8220;some other proof require, <br />
Rash was my promise, rash is thy desire. <br />
I&#8217;d fain deny this wish, which thou hast made, <br />
Or, what I can&#8217;t deny, wou&#8217;d fain disswade. <br />
Too vast and hazardous the task appears, <br />
Nor suited to thy strength, nor to thy years. <br />
Thy lot is mortal, but thy wishes fly <br />
Beyond the province of mortality: <br />
There is not one of all the Gods that dares <br />
(However skill&#8217;d in other great affairs) <br />
To mount the burning axle-tree, but I; <br />
Not Jove himself, the ruler of the sky, <br />
That hurles the three-fork&#8217;d thunder from above, <br />
Dares try his strength: yet who so strong as Jove? <br />
The steeds climb up the first ascent with pain, <br />
And when the middle firmament they gain, <br />
If downward from the Heav&#8217;ns my head I bow, <br />
And see the Earth and Ocean hang below, <br />
Ev&#8217;n I am seiz&#8217;d with horror and affright, <br />
And my own heart misgives me at the sight. <br />
A mighty downfal steeps the ev&#8217;ning stage, <br />
And steddy reins must curb the horses&#8217; rage. <br />
Tethys herself has fear&#8217;d to see me driv&#8217;n <br />
Down headlong from the precipice of Heav&#8217;n. <br />
Besides, consider what impetuous force <br />
Turns stars and planets in a diff&#8217;rent course. <br />
I steer against their motions; nor am I <br />
Born back by all the current of the sky. <br />
But how cou&#8217;d you resist the orbs that roul <br />
In adverse whirls, and stem the rapid pole? <br />
But you perhaps may hope for pleasing woods, <br />
And stately dooms, and cities fill&#8217;d with Gods; <br />
While through a thousand snares your progress lies, <br />
Where forms of starry monsters stock the skies: <br />
For, shou&#8217;d you hit the doubtful way aright, <br />
The bull with stooping horns stands opposite; <br />
Next him the bright Haemonian bow is strung, <br />
And next, the lion&#8217;s grinning visage hung: <br />
The scorpion&#8217;s claws, here clasp a wide extent; <br />
And here the crab&#8217;s in lesser clasps are bent. <br />
Nor wou&#8217;d you find it easie to compose <br />
The mettled steeds, when from their nostrils flows <br />
The scorching fire, that in their entrails glows. <br />
Ev&#8217;n I their head-strong fury scarce restrain, <br />
When they grow warm and restif to the rein. <br />
Let not my son a fatal gift require, <br />
But, O! in time, recall your rash desire; <br />
You ask a gift that may your parent tell, <br />
Let these my fears your parentage reveal; <br />
And learn a father from a father&#8217;s care: <br />
Look on my face; or if my heart lay bare, <br />
Cou&#8217;d you but look, you&#8217;d read the father there. <br />
Chuse out a gift from seas, or Earth, or skies, <br />
For open to your wish all Nature lies, <br />
Only decline this one unequal task, <br />
For &#8217;tis a mischief, not a gift, you ask. <br />
You ask a real mischief, Phaeton: <br />
Nay hang not thus about my neck, my son: <br />
I grant your wish, and Styx has heard my voice, <br />
Chuse what you will, but make a wiser choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus did the God th&#8217; unwary youth advise; <br />
But he still longs to travel through the skies. <br />
When the fond father (for in vain he pleads) <br />
At length to the Vulcanian Chariot leads. <br />
A golden axle did the work uphold, <br />
Gold was the beam, the wheels were orb&#8217;d with gold. <br />
The spokes in rows of silver pleas&#8217;d the sight, <br />
The seat with party-colour&#8217;d gems was bright; <br />
Apollo shin&#8217;d amid the glare of light. <br />
The youth with secret joy the work surveys, <br />
When now the moon disclos&#8217;d her purple rays; <br />
The stars were fled, for Lucifer had chased <br />
The stars away, and fled himself at last. <br />
Soon as the father saw the rosy morn, <br />
And the moon shining with a blunter horn, <br />
He bid the nimble Hours, without delay, <br />
Bring forth the steeds; the nimble Hours obey: <br />
From their full racks the gen&#8217;rous steeds retire, <br />
Dropping ambrosial foams, and snorting fire. <br />
Still anxious for his son, the God of day, <br />
To make him proof against the burning ray, <br />
His temples with celestial ointment wet, <br />
Of sov&#8217;reign virtue to repel the heat; <br />
Then fix&#8217;d the beamy circle on his head, <br />
And fetch&#8217;d a deep foreboding sigh, and said, <br />
&#8220;Take this at least, this last advice, my son, <br />
Keep a stiff rein, and move but gently on: <br />
The coursers of themselves will run too fast, <br />
Your art must be to moderate their haste. <br />
Drive &#8216;em not on directly through the skies, <br />
But where the Zodiac&#8217;s winding circle lies, <br />
Along the midmost Zone; but sally forth <br />
Nor to the distant south, nor stormy north. <br />
The horses&#8217; hoofs a beaten track will show, <br />
But neither mount too high, nor sink too low. <br />
That no new fires, or Heav&#8217;n or Earth infest; <br />
Keep the mid way, the middle way is best. <br />
Nor, where in radiant folds the serpent twines, <br />
Direct your course, nor where the altar shines. <br />
Shun both extreams; the rest let Fortune guide, <br />
And better for thee than thy self provide! <br />
See, while I speak, the shades disperse away, <br />
Aurora gives the promise of a day; <br />
I&#8217;m call&#8217;d, nor can I make a longer stay. <br />
Snatch up the reins; or still th&#8217; attempt forsake, <br />
And not my chariot, but my counsel, take, <br />
While yet securely on the Earth you stand; <br />
Nor touch the horses with too rash a hand. <br />
Let me alone to light the world, while you <br />
Enjoy those beams which you may safely view.&#8221; <br />
He spoke in vain; the youth with active heat <br />
And sprightly vigour vaults into the seat; <br />
And joys to hold the reins, and fondly gives <br />
Those thanks his father with remorse receives.</p>
<p>Mean-while the restless horses neigh&#8217;d aloud, <br />
Breathing out fire, and pawing where they stood. <br />
Tethys, not knowing what had past, gave way, <br />
And all the waste of Heav&#8217;n before &#8216;em lay. <br />
They spring together out, and swiftly bear <br />
The flying youth thro&#8217; clouds and yielding air; <br />
With wingy speed outstrip the eastern wind, <br />
And leave the breezes of the morn behind. <br />
The youth was light, nor cou&#8217;d he fill the seat, <br />
Or poise the chariot with its wonted weight: <br />
But as at sea th&#8217; unballass&#8217;d vessel rides, <br />
Cast to and fro, the sport of winds and tides; <br />
So in the bounding chariot toss&#8217;d on high, <br />
The youth is hurry&#8217;d headlong through the sky. <br />
Soon as the steeds perceive it, they forsake <br />
Their stated course, and leave the beaten track. <br />
The youth was in a maze, nor did he know <br />
Which way to turn the reins, or where to go; <br />
Nor wou&#8217;d the horses, had he known, obey. <br />
Then the sev&#8217;n stars first felt Apollo&#8217;s ray, <br />
And wish&#8217;d to dip in the forbidden sea. <br />
The folded serpent next the frozen pole, <br />
Stiff and benum&#8217;d before, began to rowle, <br />
And raged with inward heat, and threaten&#8217;d war, <br />
And shot a redder light from ev&#8217;ry star; <br />
Nay, and &#8217;tis said Bootes too, that fain <br />
Thou woud&#8217;st have fled, tho&#8217; cumber&#8217;d with thy wane.</p>
<p>Th&#8217; unhappy youth then, bending down his head, <br />
Saw Earth and Ocean far beneath him spread. <br />
His colour chang&#8217;d, he startled at the sight, <br />
And his eyes darken&#8217;d by too great a light. <br />
Now cou&#8217;d he wish the fiery steeds untry&#8217;d, <br />
His birth obscure, and his request deny&#8217;d: <br />
Now wou&#8217;d he Merops for his father own, <br />
And quit his boasted kindred to the sun.</p>
<p>So fares the pilot, when his ship is tost <br />
In troubled seas, and all its steerage lost, <br />
He gives her to the winds, and in despair <br />
Seeks his last refuge in the Gods and pray&#8217;r.</p>
<p>What cou&#8217;d he do? his eyes, if backward cast, <br />
Find a long path he had already past; <br />
If forward, still a longer path they find: <br />
Both he compares, and measures in his mind; <br />
And sometimes casts an eye upon the east, <br />
And sometimes looks on the forbidden west, <br />
The horses&#8217; names he knew not in the fright, <br />
Nor wou&#8217;d he loose the reins, nor cou&#8217;d he hold &#8216;em right.</p>
<p>Now all the horrors of the Heav&#8217;ns he spies, <br />
And monstrous shadows of prodigious size, <br />
That, deck&#8217;d with stars, lye scatter&#8217;d o&#8217;er the skies. <br />
There is a place above, where Scorpio bent <br />
In tail and arms surrounds a vast extent; <br />
In a wide circuit of the Heav&#8217;ns he shines, <br />
And fills the space of two coelestial signs. <br />
Soon as the youth beheld him vex&#8217;d with heat <br />
Brandish his sting, and in his poison sweat, <br />
Half dead with sudden fear he dropt the reins; <br />
The horses felt &#8216;em loose upon their mains, <br />
And, flying out through all the plains above, <br />
Ran uncontroul&#8217;d where-e&#8217;re their fury drove; <br />
Rush&#8217;d on the stars, and through a pathless way <br />
Of unknown regions hurry&#8217;d on the day. <br />
And now above, and now below they flew, <br />
And near the Earth the burning chariot drew.</p>
<p>The clouds disperse in fumes, the wond&#8217;ring Moon <br />
Beholds her brother&#8217;s steeds beneath her own; <br />
The highlands smoak, cleft by the piercing rays, <br />
Or, clad with woods, in their own fewel blaze. <br />
Next o&#8217;er the plains, where ripen&#8217;d harvests grow, <br />
The running conflagration spreads below. <br />
But these are trivial ills: whole cities burn, <br />
And peopled kingdoms into ashes turn.</p>
<p>The mountains kindle as the car draws near, <br />
Athos and Tmolus red with fires appear; <br />
Oeagrian Haemus (then a single name) <br />
And virgin Helicon increase the flame; <br />
Taurus and Oete glare amid the sky, <br />
And Ida, spight of all her fountains, dry. <br />
Eryx and Othrys, and Cithaeron, glow, <br />
And Rhodope, no longer cloath&#8217;d in snow; <br />
High Pindus, Mimas, and Parnassus, sweat, <br />
And Aetna rages with redoubled heat. <br />
Ev&#8217;n Scythia, through her hoary regions warm&#8217;d, <br />
In vain with all her native frost was arm&#8217;d. <br />
Cover&#8217;d with flames the tow&#8217;ring Appennine, <br />
And Caucasus, and proud Olympus, shine; <br />
And, where the long-extended Alpes aspire, <br />
Now stands a huge continu&#8217;d range of fire.</p>
<p>Th&#8217; astonisht youth, where-e&#8217;er his eyes cou&#8217;d turn, <br />
Beheld the universe around him burn: <br />
The world was in a blaze; nor cou&#8217;d he bear <br />
The sultry vapours and the scorching air, <br />
Which from below, as from a furnace, flow&#8217;d; <br />
And now the axle-tree beneath him glow&#8217;d: <br />
Lost in the whirling clouds that round him broke, <br />
And white with ashes, hov&#8217;ring in the smoke. <br />
He flew where-e&#8217;er the horses drove, nor knew <br />
Whither the horses drove, or where he flew.</p>
<p>&#8216;Twas then, they say, the swarthy Moor begun <br />
To change his hue, and blacken in the sun. <br />
Then Libya first, of all her moisture drain&#8217;d, <br />
Became a barren waste, a wild of sand. <br />
The water-nymphs lament their empty urns, <br />
Boeotia, robb&#8217;s of silve Dirce, mourns, <br />
Corinth Pyrene&#8217;s wasted spring bewails, <br />
And Argos grieves whilst Amymone fails.</p>
<p>The floods are drain&#8217;d from ev&#8217;ry distant coast, <br />
Ev&#8217;n Tanais, tho&#8217; fix&#8217;d in ice, was lost. <br />
Enrag&#8217;d Caicus and Lycormas roar, <br />
And Xanthus, fated to be burnt once more. <br />
The fam&#8217;d Maeander, that unweary&#8217;d strays <br />
Through mazy windings, smoaks in ev&#8217;ry maze. <br />
From his lov&#8217;d Babylon Euphrates flies; <br />
The big-swoln Ganges and the Danube rise <br />
In thick&#8217;ning fumes, and darken half the skies. <br />
In flames Ismenos and the Phasis roul&#8217;d, <br />
And Tagus floating in his melted gold. <br />
The swans, that on Cayster often try&#8217;d <br />
Their tuneful songs, now sung their last and dy&#8217;d. <br />
The frighted Nile ran off, and under ground <br />
Conceal&#8217;d his head, nor can it yet be found: <br />
His sev&#8217;n divided currents all are dry, <br />
And where they row&#8217;ld, sev&#8217;n gaping trenches lye: <br />
No more the Rhine or Rhone their course maintain, <br />
Nor Tiber, of his promis&#8217;d empire vain.</p>
<p>The ground, deep-cleft, admits the dazling ray, <br />
And startles Pluto with the flash of day. <br />
The seas shrink in, and to the sight disclose <br />
Wide naked plains, where once their billows rose; <br />
Their rocks are all discover&#8217;d, and increase <br />
The number of the scatter&#8217;d Cyclades. <br />
The fish in sholes about the bottom creep, <br />
Nor longer dares the crooked dolphin leap <br />
Gasping for breath, th&#8217; unshapen Phocae die, <br />
And on the boiling wave extended lye. <br />
Nereus, and Doris with her virgin train, <br />
Seek out the last recesses of the main; <br />
Beneath unfathomable depths they faint, <br />
And secret in their gloomy caverns pant. <br />
Stern Neptune thrice above the waves upheld <br />
His face, and thrice was by the flames repell&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The Earth at length, on ev&#8217;ry side embrac&#8217;d <br />
With scalding seas that floated round her waste, <br />
When now she felt the springs and rivers come, <br />
And crowd within the hollow of her womb, <br />
Up-lifted to the Heav&#8217;ns her blasted head, <br />
And clapt her hand upon her brows, and said <br />
(But first, impatient of the sultry heat, <br />
Sunk deeper down, and sought a cooler seat): <br />
&#8220;If you, great king of Gods, my death approve, <br />
And I deserve it, let me die by Jove; <br />
If I must perish by the force of fire, <br />
Let me transfix&#8217;d with thunder-bolts expire. <br />
See, whilst I speak, my breath the vapours choak <br />
(For now her face lay wrapt in clouds of smoak), <br />
See my singe&#8217;d hair, behold my faded eye, <br />
And wither&#8217;d face, where heaps of cinders lye! <br />
And does the plow for this my body tear? <br />
This the reward for all the fruits I bear, <br />
Tortur&#8217;d with rakes, and harrass&#8217;d all the year? <br />
That herbs for cattle daily I renew, <br />
And food for Man, and frankincense for you? <br />
But grant me guilty; what has Neptune done? <br />
Why are his waters boiling in the sun? <br />
The wavy empire, which by lot was giv&#8217;n, <br />
Why does it waste, and further shrink from Heav&#8217;n? <br />
If I nor he your pity can provoke, <br />
See your own Heav&#8217;ns, the Heav&#8217;ns begin to smoke! <br />
Shou&#8217;d once the sparkles catch those bright abodes, <br />
Destruction seizes on the Heav&#8217;ns and Gods; <br />
Atlas becomes unequal to his freight, <br />
And almost faints beneath the glowing weight. <br />
If Heav&#8217;n, and Earth, and sea, together burn, <br />
All must again into their chaos turn. <br />
Apply some speedy cure, prevent our fate, <br />
And succour Nature, ere it be too late.&#8221; <br />
She cea&#8217;sd, for choak&#8217;d with vapours round her spread, <br />
Down to the deepest shades she sunk her head.</p>
<p>Jove call&#8217;d to witness ev&#8217;ry Pow&#8217;r above, <br />
And ev&#8217;n the God, whose son the chariot drove, <br />
That what he acts he is compell&#8217;d to do, <br />
Or universal ruin must ensue. <br />
Strait he ascends the high aetherial throne, <br />
From whence he us&#8217;d to dart his thunder down, <br />
From whence his show&#8217;rs and storms he us&#8217;d to pour, <br />
But now cou&#8217;d meet with neither storm nor show&#8217;r. <br />
Then, aiming at the youth, with lifted hand, <br />
Full at his head he hurl&#8217;d the forky brand, <br />
In dreadful thund&#8217;rings. Thus th&#8217; almighty sire <br />
Suppress&#8217;d the raging of the fires with fire.</p>
<p>At once from life and from the chariot driv&#8217;n, <br />
Th&#8217; ambitious boy fell thunder-struck from Heav&#8217;n. <br />
The horses started with a sudden bound, <br />
And flung the reins and chariot to the ground: <br />
The studded harness from their necks they broke, <br />
Here fell a wheel, and here a silver spoke, <br />
Here were the beam and axle torn away; <br />
And, scatter&#8217;d o&#8217;er the Earth, the shining fragments lay. <br />
The breathless Phaeton, with flaming hair, <br />
Shot from the chariot, like a falling star, <br />
That in a summer&#8217;s ev&#8217;ning from the top <br />
Of Heav&#8217;n drops down, or seems at least to drop; <br />
&#8216;Till on the Po his blasted corps was hurl&#8217;d, <br />
Far from his country, in the western world.</p>
<p>Phaeton&#8217;s Sisters transform&#8217;d into Trees</p>
<p>The Latian nymphs came round him, and, amaz&#8217;d, <br />
On the dead youth, transfix&#8217;d with thunder, gaz&#8217;d; <br />
And, whilst yet smoaking from the bolt he lay, <br />
His shatter&#8217;d body to a tomb convey, <br />
And o&#8217;er the tomb an epitaph devise: <br />
&#8220;Here he, who drove the sun&#8217;s bright chariot, lies; <br />
His father&#8217;s fiery steeds he cou&#8217;d not guide, <br />
But in the glorious enterprize he dy&#8217;d.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apollo hid his face, and pin&#8217;d for grief, <br />
And, if the story may deserve belief, <br />
The space of one whole day is said to run, <br />
From morn to wonted ev&#8217;n, without a sun: <br />
The burning ruins, with a fainter ray, <br />
Supply the sun, and counterfeit a day, <br />
A day, that still did Nature&#8217;s face disclose: <br />
This comfort from the mighty mischief rose.</p>
<p>But Clymene, enrag&#8217;d with grief, laments, <br />
And as her grief inspires, her passion vents: <br />
Wild for her son, and frantick in her woes, <br />
With hair dishevel&#8217;d round the world she goes, <br />
To seek where-e&#8217;er his body might be cast; <br />
&#8216;Till, on the borders of the Po, at last <br />
The name inscrib&#8217;d on the new tomb appears. <br />
The dear dear name she bathes in flowing tears, <br />
Hangs o&#8217;er the tomb, unable to depart, <br />
And hugs the marble to her throbbing heart.</p>
<p>Her daughters too lament, and sigh, and mourn <br />
(A fruitless tribute to their brother&#8217;s urn), <br />
And beat their naked bosoms, and complain, <br />
And call aloud for Phaeton in vain: <br />
All the long night their mournful watch they keep, <br />
And all the day stand round the tomb, and weep.</p>
<p>Four times, revolving, the full moon return&#8217;d; <br />
So long the mother and the daughters mourn&#8217;d: <br />
When now the eldest, Phaethusa, strove <br />
To rest her weary limbs, but could not move; <br />
Lampetia wou&#8217;d have help&#8217;d her, but she found <br />
Her self with-held, and rooted to the ground: <br />
A third in wild affliction, as she grieves, <br />
Wou&#8217;d rend her hair, but fills her hands with leaves; <br />
One sees her thighs transform&#8217;d, another views <br />
Her arms shot out, and branching into boughs. <br />
And now their legs, and breasts, and bodies stood <br />
Crusted with bark, and hard&#8217;ning into wood; <br />
But still above were female heads display&#8217;d, <br />
And mouths, that call&#8217;d the mother to their aid. <br />
What cou&#8217;d, alas! the weeping mother do? <br />
From this to that with eager haste she flew, <br />
And kiss&#8217;d her sprouting daughters as they grew. <br />
She tears the bark that to each body cleaves, <br />
And from their verdant fingers strips the leaves: <br />
The blood came trickling, where she tore away <br />
The leaves and bark: the maids were heard to say, <br />
&#8220;Forbear, mistaken parent, oh! forbear; <br />
A wounded daughter in each tree you tear; <br />
Farewell for ever.&#8221; Here the bark encreas&#8217;d, <br />
Clos&#8217;d on their faces, and their words suppress&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The new-made trees in tears of amber run, <br />
Which, harden&#8217;d into value by the sun, <br />
Distill for ever on the streams below: <br />
The limpid streams their radiant treasure show, <br />
Mixt in the sand; whence the rich drops convey&#8217;d <br />
Shine in the dress of the bright Latian maid.</p>
<p>The Transformation of Cycnus into a Swan</p>
<p>Cycnus beheld the nymphs transform&#8217;d, ally&#8217;d <br />
To their dead brother on the mortal side, <br />
In friendship and affection nearer bound; <br />
He left the cities and the realms he own&#8217;d, <br />
Thro&#8217; pathless fields and lonely shores to range, <br />
And woods made thicker by the sisters&#8217; change. <br />
Whilst here, within the dismal gloom, alone, <br />
The melancholy monarch made his moan, <br />
His voice was lessen&#8217;d, as he try&#8217;d to speak, <br />
And issu&#8217;d through a long-extended neck; <br />
His hair transforms to down, his fingers meet <br />
In skinny films, and shape his oary feet; <br />
From both his sides the wings and feathers break; <br />
And from his mouth proceeds a blunted beak: <br />
All Cycnus now into a Swan was turn&#8217;d, <br />
Who, still remembring how his kinsman burn&#8217;d, <br />
To solitary pools and lakes retires, <br />
And loves the waters as oppos&#8217;d to fires.</p>
<p>Mean-while Apollo in a gloomy shade <br />
(The native lustre of his brows decay&#8217;d) <br />
Indulging sorrow, sickens at the sight <br />
Of his own sun-shine, and abhors the light; <br />
The hidden griefs, that in his bosom rise, <br />
Sadden his looks and over-cast his eyes, <br />
As when some dusky orb obstructs his ray, <br />
And sullies in a dim eclipse the day.</p>
<p>Now secretly with inward griefs he pin&#8217;d, <br />
Now warm resentments to his griefs he joyn&#8217;d, <br />
And now renounc&#8217;d his office to mankind. <br />
&#8220;Ere since the birth of time,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;ve born <br />
A long ungrateful toil, without return; <br />
Let now some other manage, if he dare, <br />
The fiery steeds, and mount the burning carr; <br />
Or, if none else, let Jove his fortune try, <br />
And learn to lay his murd&#8217;ring thunder by; <br />
Then will he own, perhaps, but own too late, <br />
My son deserv&#8217;d not so severe a fate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Gods stand round him, as he mourns, and pray <br />
He would resume the conduct of the day, <br />
Nor let the world be lost in endless night: <br />
Jove too himself descending from his height, <br />
Excuses what had happen&#8217;d, and intreats, <br />
Majestically mixing pray&#8217;rs and threats. <br />
Prevail&#8217;d upon at length, again he took <br />
The harness&#8217;d steeds, that still with horror shook, <br />
And plies &#8216;em with the lash, and whips &#8216;em on, <br />
And, as he whips, upbraids &#8216;em with his son.</p>
<p>The Story of Calisto</p>
<p>The day was settled in its course; and Jove <br />
Walk&#8217;d the wide circuit of the Heavens above, <br />
To search if any cracks or flaws were made; <br />
But all was safe: the Earth he then survey&#8217;d, <br />
And cast an eye on ev&#8217;ry diff&#8217;rent coast, <br />
And ev&#8217;ry land; but on Arcadia most. <br />
Her fields he cloath&#8217;d, and chear&#8217;d her blasted face <br />
With running fountains, and with springing grass. <br />
No tracks of Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s destructive fire remain, <br />
The fields and woods revive, and Nature smiles again.</p>
<p>But as the God walk&#8217;d to and fro the Earth, <br />
And rais&#8217;d the plants, and gave the spring its birth, <br />
By chance a fair Arcadian nymph he view&#8217;d, <br />
And felt the lovely charmer in his blood. <br />
The nymph nor spun, nor dress&#8217;d with artful pride, <br />
Her vest was gather&#8217;d up, her hair was ty&#8217;d; <br />
Now in her hand a slender spear she bore, <br />
Now a light quiver on her shoulders wore; <br />
To chaste Diana from her youth inclin&#8217;d, <br />
The sprightly warriors of the wood she joyn&#8217;d. <br />
Diana too the gentle huntress lov&#8217;d, <br />
Nor was there one of all the nymphs that rov&#8217;d <br />
O&#8217;er Maenalus, amid the maiden throng, <br />
More favour&#8217;d once; but favour lasts not long.</p>
<p>The sun now shone in all its strength, and drove <br />
The heated virgin panting to a grove; <br />
The grove around a grateful shadow cast: <br />
She dropt her arrows, and her bow unbrac&#8217;d; <br />
She flung her self on the cool grassy bed; <br />
And on the painted quiver rais&#8217;d her head, <br />
Jove saw the charming huntress unprepar&#8217;d, <br />
Stretch&#8217;d on the verdant turf, without a guard. <br />
&#8220;Here I am safe,&#8221; he cries, &#8220;from Juno&#8217;s eye; <br />
Or shou&#8217;d my jealous queen the theft descry, <br />
Yet wou&#8217;d I venture on a theft like this, <br />
And stand her rage for such, for such a bliss!&#8221; <br />
Diana&#8217;s shape and habit strait he took, <br />
Soften&#8217;d his brows, and smooth&#8217;d his awful look, <br />
And mildly in a female accent spoke. <br />
&#8220;How fares my girl? How went the morning chase?&#8221; <br />
To whom the virgin, starting from the grass, <br />
&#8220;All hail, bright deity, whom I prefer <br />
To Jove himself, tho&#8217; Jove himself were here.&#8221; <br />
The God was nearer than she thought, and heard <br />
Well-pleas&#8217;d himself before himself preferr&#8217;d.</p>
<p>He then salutes her with a warm embrace; <br />
And, e&#8217;re she half had told the morning chase, <br />
With love enflam&#8217;d, and eager on his bliss, <br />
Smother&#8217;d her words, and stop&#8217;d her with a kiss; <br />
His kisses with unwonted ardour glow&#8217;d, <br />
Nor cou&#8217;d Diana&#8217;s shape conceal the God. <br />
The virgin did whate&#8217;er a virgin cou&#8217;d <br />
(Sure Juno must have pardon&#8217;d, had she view&#8217;d); <br />
With all her might against his force she strove; <br />
But how can mortal maids contend with Jove?</p>
<p>Possest at length of what his heart desir&#8217;d, <br />
Back to his Heav&#8217;ns, th&#8217; exulting God retir&#8217;d. <br />
The lovely huntress, rising from the grass, <br />
With down-cast eyes, and with a blushing face, <br />
By shame confounded, and by fear dismay&#8217;d, <br />
Flew from the covert of the guilty shade, <br />
And almost, in the tumult of her mind, <br />
Left her forgotten bow and shafts behind.</p>
<p>But now Diana, with a sprightly train <br />
Of quiver&#8217;d virgins, bounding o&#8217;er the plain, <br />
Call&#8217;d to the nymph; the nymph began to fear <br />
A second fraud, a Jove disguis&#8217;d in her; <br />
But, when she saw the sister nymphs, suppress&#8217;d <br />
Her rising fears, and mingled with the rest.</p>
<p>How in the look does conscious guilt appear! <br />
Slowly she mov&#8217;d, and loiter&#8217;d in the rear; <br />
Nor lightly tripp&#8217;d, nor by the Goddess ran, <br />
As once she us&#8217;d, the foremost of the train. <br />
Her looks were flush&#8217;d, and sullen was her mien, <br />
That sure the virgin Goddess (had she been <br />
Aught but a virgin) must the guilt have seen. <br />
&#8216;Tis said the nymphs saw all, and guess&#8217;d aright: <br />
And now the moon had nine times lost her light, <br />
When Dian, fainting in the mid-day beams, <br />
Found a cool covert, and refreshing streams <br />
That in soft murmurs through the forest flow&#8217;d, <br />
And a smooth bed of shining gravel show&#8217;d.</p>
<p>A covert so obscure, and streams so clear, <br />
The Goddess prais&#8217;d: &#8220;And now no spies are near <br />
Let&#8217;s strip, my gentle maids, and wash,&#8221; she cries. <br />
Pleas&#8217;d with the motion, every maid complies; <br />
Only the blushing huntress stood confus&#8217;d, <br />
And form&#8217;d delays, and her delays excus&#8217;d; <br />
In vain excus&#8217;d: her fellows round her press&#8217;d, <br />
And the reluctant nymph by force undress&#8217;d, <br />
The naked huntress all her shame reveal&#8217;d, <br />
In vain her hands the pregnant womb conceal&#8217;d; <br />
&#8220;Begone!&#8221; the Goddess cries with stern disdain, <br />
&#8220;Begone! nor dare the hallow&#8217;d stream to stain&#8221;: <br />
She fled, for ever banish&#8217;d from the train.</p>
<p>This Juno heard, who long had watch&#8217;d her time <br />
To punish the detested rival&#8217;s crime; <br />
The time was come; for, to enrage her more, <br />
A lovely boy the teeming rival bore.</p>
<p>The Goddess cast a furious look, and cry&#8217;d, <br />
&#8220;It is enough! I&#8217;m fully satisfy&#8217;d! <br />
This boy shall stand a living mark, to prove <br />
My husband&#8217;s baseness and the strumpet&#8217;s love: <br />
But vengeance shall awake: those guilty charms <br />
That drew the Thunderer from Juno&#8217;s arms, <br />
No longer shall their wonted force retain, <br />
Nor please the God, nor make the mortal vain.&#8221;</p>
<p>This said, her hand within her hair she wound, <br />
Swung her to Earth, and drag&#8217;d her on the ground: <br />
The prostrate wretch lifts up her arms in pray&#8217;r; <br />
Her arms grow shaggy, and deform&#8217;d with hair, <br />
Her nails are sharpen&#8217;d into pointed claws, <br />
Her hands bear half her weight, and turn to paws; <br />
Her lips, that once cou&#8217;d tempt a God, begin <br />
To grow distorted in an ugly grin. <br />
And, lest the supplicating brute might reach <br />
The ears of Jove, she was depriv&#8217;d of speech: <br />
Her surly voice thro&#8217; a hoarse passage came <br />
In savage sounds: her mind was still the same, <br />
The furry monster fix&#8217;d her eyes above, <br />
And heav&#8217;d her new unwieldy paws to Jove, <br />
And beg&#8217;d his aid with inward groans; and tho&#8217; <br />
She could not call him false, she thought him so.</p>
<p>How did she fear to lodge in woods alone, <br />
And haunt the fields and meadows, once her own! <br />
How often wou&#8217;d the deep-mouth&#8217;d dogs pursue, <br />
Whilst from her hounds the frighted huntress flew! <br />
How did she fear her fellow-brutes, and shun <br />
The shaggy bear, tho&#8217; now her self was one! <br />
How from the sight of rugged wolves retire, <br />
Although the grim Lycaon was her sire!</p>
<p>But now her son had fifteen summers told, <br />
Fierce at the chase, and in the forest bold; <br />
When, as he beat the woods in quest of prey, <br />
He chanc&#8217;d to rouze his mother where she lay. <br />
She knew her son, and kept him in her sight, <br />
And fondly gaz&#8217;d: the boy was in a fright, <br />
And aim&#8217;d a pointed arrow at her breast, <br />
And would have slain his mother in the beast; <br />
But Jove forbad, and snatch&#8217;d &#8216;em through the air <br />
In whirlwinds up to Heav&#8217;n, and fix&#8217;d &#8216;em there! <br />
Where the new constellations nightly rise, <br />
And add a lustre to the northern skies.</p>
<p>When Juno saw the rival in her height, <br />
Spangled with stars, and circled round with light, <br />
She sought old Ocean in his deep abodes, <br />
And Tethys, both rever&#8217;d among the Gods. <br />
They ask what brings her there: &#8220;Ne&#8217;er ask,&#8221; says she, <br />
&#8220;What brings me here, Heav&#8217;n is no place for me. <br />
You&#8217;ll see, when night has cover&#8217;d all things o&#8217;er, <br />
Jove&#8217;s starry bastard and triumphant whore <br />
Usurp the Heav&#8217;ns; you&#8217;ll see &#8216;em proudly rowle <br />
And who shall now on Juno&#8217;s altars wait, <br />
When those she hates grow greater by her hate? <br />
I on the nymph a brutal form impress&#8217;d, <br />
Jove to a goddess has transform&#8217;d the beast; <br />
This, this was all my weak revenge could do: <br />
But let the God his chaste amours pursue, <br />
And, as he acted after Io&#8217;s rape, <br />
Restore th&#8217; adultress to her former shape; <br />
Then may he cast his Juno off, and lead <br />
The great Lycaon&#8217;s offspring to his bed. <br />
But you, ye venerable Pow&#8217;rs, be kind, <br />
And, if my wrongs a due resentment find, <br />
Receive not in your waves their setting beams, <br />
Nor let the glaring strumpet taint your streams.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Goddess ended, and her wish was giv&#8217;n. <br />
Back she return&#8217;d in triumph up to Heav&#8217;n; <br />
Her gawdy peacocks drew her through the skies. <br />
Their tails were spotted with a thousand eyes; <br />
The eyes of Argus on their tails were rang&#8217;d, <br />
At the same time the raven&#8217;s colour chang&#8217;d.</p>
<p>The Story of Coronis, and Birth of Aesculapius</p>
<p>The raven once in snowy plumes was drest, <br />
White as the whitest dove&#8217;s unsully&#8217;d breast, <br />
Fair as the guardian of the Capitol, <br />
Soft as the swan; a large and lovely fowl; <br />
His tongue, his prating tongue had chang&#8217;d him quite <br />
To sooty blackness, from the purest white.</p>
<p>The story of his change shall here be told; <br />
In Thessaly there liv&#8217;d a nymph of old, <br />
Coronis nam&#8217;d; a peerless maid she shin&#8217;d, <br />
Confest the fairest of the fairer kind. <br />
Apollo lov&#8217;d her, &#8217;till her guilt he knew, <br />
While true she was, or whilst he thought her true. <br />
But his own bird the raven chanc&#8217;d to find <br />
The false one with a secret rival joyn&#8217;d. <br />
Coronis begg&#8217;d him to suppress the tale, <br />
But could not with repeated pray&#8217;rs prevail. <br />
His milk-white pinions to the God he ply&#8217;d; <br />
The busy daw flew with him, side by side, <br />
And by a thousand teizing questions drew <br />
Th&#8217; important secret from him as they flew. <br />
The daw gave honest counsel, tho&#8217; despis&#8217;d, <br />
And, tedious in her tattle, thus advis&#8217;d: <br />
&#8220;Stay, silly bird, th&#8217; ill-natur&#8217;d task refuse, <br />
Nor be the bearer of unwelcome news. <br />
Be warn&#8217;d by my example: you discern <br />
What now I am, and what I was shall learn. <br />
My foolish honesty was all my crime; <br />
Then hear my story. Once upon a time, <br />
The two-shap&#8217;d Ericthonius had his birth <br />
(Without a mother) from the teeming Earth; <br />
Minerva nurs&#8217;d him, and the infant laid <br />
Within a chest, of twining osiers made. <br />
The daughters of king Cecrops undertook <br />
To guard the chest, commanded not to look <br />
On what was hid within. I stood to see <br />
The charge obey&#8217;d, perch&#8217;d on a neighb&#8217;ring tree. <br />
The sisters Pandrosos and Herse keep <br />
The strict command; Aglauros needs would peep, <br />
And saw the monstrous infant, in a fright, <br />
And call&#8217;d her sisters to the hideous sight: <br />
A boy&#8217;s soft shape did to the waste prevail, <br />
But the boy ended in a dragon&#8217;s tail. <br />
I told the stern Minerva all that pass&#8217;d; <br />
But for my pains, discarded and disgrac&#8217;d, <br />
The frowning Goddess drove me from her sight, <br />
And for her fav&#8217;rite chose the bird of night. <br />
Be then no tell-tale; for I think my wrong <br />
Enough to teach a bird to hold her tongue.</p>
<p>But you, perhaps, may think I was remov&#8217;d, <br />
As never by the heav&#8217;nly maid belov&#8217;d: <br />
But I was lov&#8217;d; ask Pallas if I lye; <br />
Tho&#8217; Pallas hate me now, she won&#8217;t deny: <br />
For I, whom in a feather&#8217;d shape you view, <br />
Was once a maid (by Heav&#8217;n the story&#8217;s true) <br />
A blooming maid, and a king&#8217;s daughter too. <br />
A crowd of lovers own&#8217;d my beauty&#8217;s charms; <br />
My beauty was the cause of all my harms; <br />
Neptune, as on his shores I wont to rove, <br />
Observ&#8217;d me in my walks, and fell in love. <br />
He made his courtship, he confess&#8217;d his pain, <br />
And offer&#8217;d force, when all his arts were vain; <br />
Swift he pursu&#8217;d: I ran along the strand, <br />
&#8216;Till, spent and weary&#8217;d on the sinking sand, <br />
I shriek&#8217;d aloud, with cries I fill&#8217;d the air <br />
To Gods and men; nor God nor man was there: <br />
A virgin Goddess heard a virgin&#8217;s pray&#8217;r. <br />
For, as my arms I lifted to the skies, <br />
I saw black feathers from my fingers rise; <br />
I strove to fling my garment on the ground; <br />
My garment turn&#8217;d to plumes, and girt me round: <br />
My hands to beat my naked bosom try; <br />
Nor naked bosom now nor hands had I: <br />
Lightly I tript, nor weary as before <br />
Sunk in the sand, but skim&#8217;d along the shore; <br />
&#8216;Till, rising on my wings, I was preferr&#8217;d <br />
To be the chaste Minerva&#8217;s virgin bird: <br />
Preferr&#8217;d in vain! I am now in disgrace: <br />
Nyctimene the owl enjoys my place.</p>
<p>On her incestuous life I need not dwell <br />
(In Lesbos still the horrid tale they tell), <br />
And of her dire amours you must have heard, <br />
For which she now does penance in a bird, <br />
That conscious of her shame, avoids the light, <br />
And loves the gloomy cov&#8217;ring of the night; <br />
The birds, where-e&#8217;er she flutters, scare away <br />
The hooting wretch, and drive her from the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The raven, urg&#8217;d by such impertinence, <br />
Grew passionate, it seems, and took offence, <br />
And curst the harmless daw; the daw withdrew: <br />
The raven to her injur&#8217;d patron flew, <br />
And found him out, and told the fatal truth <br />
Of false Coronis and the favour&#8217;d youth.</p>
<p>The God was wroth, the colour left his look, <br />
The wreath his head, the harp his hand forsook: <br />
His silver bow and feather&#8217;d shafts he took, <br />
And lodg&#8217;d an arrow in the tender breast, <br />
That had so often to his own been prest. <br />
Down fell the wounded nymph, and sadly groan&#8217;d, <br />
And pull&#8217;d his arrow reeking from the wound; <br />
And weltring in her blood, thus faintly cry&#8217;d, <br />
&#8220;Ah cruel God! tho&#8217; I have justly dy&#8217;d, <br />
What has, alas! my unborn infant done, <br />
That he should fall, and two expire in one?&#8221; <br />
This said, in agonies she fetch&#8217;d her breath.</p>
<p>The God dissolves in pity at her death; <br />
He hates the bird that made her falshood known, <br />
And hates himself for what himself had done; <br />
The feather&#8217;d shaft, that sent her to the Fates, <br />
And his own hand, that sent the shaft, he hates. <br />
Fain would he heal the wound, and ease her pain, <br />
And tries the compass of his art in vain. <br />
Soon as he saw the lovely nymph expire, <br />
The pile made ready, and the kindling fire. <br />
With sighs and groans her obsequies he kept, <br />
And, if a God could weep, the God had wept. <br />
Her corps he kiss&#8217;d, and heav&#8217;nly incense brought, <br />
And solemniz&#8217;d the death himself had wrought.</p>
<p>But lest his offspring should her fate partake, <br />
Spight of th&#8217; immortal mixture in his make, <br />
He ript her womb, and set the child at large, <br />
And gave him to the centaur Chiron&#8217;s charge: <br />
Then in his fury black&#8217;d the raven o&#8217;er, <br />
And bid him prate in his white plumes no more.</p>
<p>Ocyrrhoe transform&#8217;d into a Mare</p>
<p>Old Chiron took the babe with secret joy, <br />
Proud of the charge of the celestial boy. <br />
His daughter too, whom on the sandy shore <br />
The nymph Charicle to the centaur bore, <br />
With hair dishevel&#8217;d on her shoulders, came <br />
To see the child, Ocyrrhoe was her name; <br />
She knew her father&#8217;s arts, and could rehearse <br />
The depths of prophecy in sounding verse. <br />
Once, as the sacred infant she survey&#8217;d, <br />
The God was kindled in the raving maid, <br />
And thus she utter&#8217;d her prophetick tale: <br />
&#8220;Hail, great physician of the world, all-hail; <br />
Hail, mighty infant, who in years to come <br />
Shalt heal the nations, and defraud the tomb; <br />
Swift be thy growth! thy triumphs unconfin&#8217;d! <br />
Make kingdoms thicker, and increase mankind. <br />
Thy daring art shall animate the dead, <br />
And draw the thunder on thy guilty head: <br />
Then shalt thou dye, but from the dark abode <br />
Rise up victorious, and be twice a God. <br />
And thou, my sire, not destin&#8217;d by thy birth <br />
To turn to dust, and mix with common earth, <br />
How wilt thou toss, and rave, and long to dye, <br />
And quit thy claim to immortality; <br />
When thou shalt feel, enrag&#8217;d with inward pains, <br />
The Hydra&#8217;s venom rankling in thy veins? <br />
The Gods, in pity, shall contract thy date, <br />
And give thee over to the pow&#8217;r of Fate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus entring into destiny, the maid <br />
The secrets of offended Jove betray&#8217;d: <br />
More had she still to say; but now appears <br />
Oppress&#8217;d with sobs and sighs, and drown&#8217;d in tears. <br />
&#8220;My voice,&#8221; says she, &#8220;is gone, my language fails; <br />
Through ev&#8217;ry limb my kindred shape prevails: <br />
Why did the God this fatal gift impart, <br />
And with prophetick raptures swell my heart! <br />
What new desires are these? I long to pace <br />
O&#8217;er flow&#8217;ry meadows, and to feed on grass; <br />
I hasten to a brute, a maid no more; <br />
But why, alas! am I transform&#8217;d all o&#8217;er? <br />
My sire does half a human shape retain, <br />
And in his upper parts preserve the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her tongue no more distinct complaints affords, <br />
But in shrill accents and mis-shapen words <br />
Pours forth such hideous wailings, as declare <br />
The human form confounded in the mare: <br />
&#8216;Till by degrees accomplish&#8217;d in the beast, <br />
She neigh&#8217;d outright, and all the steed exprest. <br />
Her stooping body on her hands is born, <br />
Her hands are turn&#8217;d to hoofs, and shod in horn, <br />
Her yellow tresses ruffle in a mane, <br />
And in a flowing tail she frisks her train, <br />
The mare was finish&#8217;d in her voice and look, <br />
And a new name from the new figure took.</p>
<p>The Transformation of Battus to a Touch stone</p>
<p>Sore wept the centuar, and to Phoebus pray&#8217;d; <br />
But how could Phoebus give the centaur aid? <br />
Degraded of his pow&#8217;r by angry Jove, <br />
In Elis then a herd of beeves he drove; <br />
And wielded in his hand a staff of oak, <br />
And o&#8217;er his shoulders threw the shepherd&#8217;s cloak; <br />
On sev&#8217;n compacted reeds he us&#8217;d to play, <br />
And on his rural pipe to waste the day.</p>
<p>As once attentive to his pipe he play&#8217;d, <br />
The crafty Hermes from the God convey&#8217;d <br />
A drove, that sep&#8217;rate from their fellows stray&#8217;d. <br />
The theft an old insidious peasant view&#8217;d <br />
(They call&#8217;d him Battus in the neighbourhood), <br />
Hir&#8217;d by a vealthy Pylian prince to feed <br />
His fav&#8217;rite mares, and watch the gen&#8217;rous breed. <br />
The thievish God suspected him, and took <br />
The hind aside, and thus in whispers spoke: <br />
&#8220;Discover not the theft, whoe&#8217;er thou be, <br />
And take that milk-white heifer for thy fee.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Go, stranger,&#8221; cries the clown, &#8220;securely on, <br />
That stone shall sooner tell,&#8221; and show&#8217;d a stone.</p>
<p>The God withdrew, but strait return&#8217;d again, <br />
In speech and habit like a country swain; <br />
And cries out, &#8220;Neighbour, hast thou seen a stray <br />
Of bullocks and of heifers pass this way? <br />
In the recov&#8217;ry of my cattle join, <br />
A bullock and a heifer shall be thine.&#8221; <br />
The peasant quick replies, &#8220;You&#8217;ll find &#8216;em there <br />
In yon dark vale&#8221;; and in the vale they were. <br />
The double bribe had his false heart beguil&#8217;d: <br />
The God, successful in the tryal, smil&#8217;d; <br />
&#8220;And dost thou thus betray my self to me? <br />
Me to my self dost thou betray?&#8221; says he: <br />
Then to a Touch stone turns the faithless spy; <br />
And in his name records his infamy.</p>
<p>The Story of Aglauros, transform&#8217;d into a Statue</p>
<p>This done, the God flew up on high, and pass&#8217;d <br />
O&#8217;er lofty Athens, by Minerva grac&#8217;d, <br />
And wide Munichia, whilst his eyes survey <br />
All the vast region that beneath him lay.</p>
<p>&#8216;Twas now the feast, when each Athenian maid <br />
Her yearly homage to Minerva paid; <br />
In canisters, with garlands cover&#8217;d o&#8217;er, <br />
High on their heads, their mystick gifts they bore: <br />
And now, returning in a solemn train, <br />
The troop of shining virgins fill&#8217;d the plain.</p>
<p>The God well pleas&#8217;d beheld the pompous show, <br />
And saw the bright procession pass below; <br />
Then veer&#8217;d about, and took a wheeling flight, <br />
And hover&#8217;d o&#8217;er them: as the spreading kite, <br />
That smells the slaughter&#8217;d victim from on high, <br />
Flies at a distance, if the priests are nigh, <br />
And sails around, and keeps it in her eye: <br />
So kept the God the virgin quire in view, <br />
And in slow winding circles round them flew.</p>
<p>As Lucifer excells the meanest star, <br />
Or, as the full-orb&#8217;d Phoebe, Lucifer; <br />
So much did Herse all the rest outvy, <br />
And gave a grace to the solemnity. <br />
Hermes was fir&#8217;d, as in the clouds he hung: <br />
So the cold bullet, that with fury slung <br />
From Balearick engines mounts on high, <br />
Glows in the whirl, and burns along the sky. <br />
At length he pitch&#8217;d upon the ground, and show&#8217;d <br />
The form divine, the features of a God. <br />
He knew their vertue o&#8217;er a female heart, <br />
And yet he strives to better them by art. <br />
He hangs his mantle loose, and sets to show <br />
The golden edging on the seam below; <br />
Adjusts his flowing curls, and in his hand <br />
Waves, with an air, the sleep-procuring wand; <br />
The glitt&#8217;ring sandals to his feet applies, <br />
And to each heel the well-trim&#8217;d pinion ties.</p>
<p>His ornaments with nicest art display&#8217;d, <br />
He seeks th&#8217; apartment of the royal maid. <br />
The roof was all with polish&#8217;d iv&#8217;ry lin&#8217;d, <br />
That richly mix&#8217;d, in clouds of tortoise shin&#8217;d. <br />
Three rooms, contiguous, in a range were plac&#8217;d, <br />
The midmost by the beauteous Herse grac&#8217;d; <br />
Her virgin sisters lodg&#8217;d on either side. <br />
Aglauros first th&#8217; approaching God descry&#8217;d, <br />
And, as he cross&#8217;d her chamber, ask&#8217;d his name, <br />
And what his business was, and whence he came. <br />
&#8220;I come,&#8221; reply&#8217;d the God, &#8220;from Heav&#8217;n, to woo <br />
Your sister, and to make an aunt of you; <br />
I am the son and messenger of Jove; <br />
My name is Mercury, my bus&#8217;ness love; <br />
Do you, kind damsel, take a lover&#8217;s part, <br />
And gain admittance to your sister&#8217;s heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>She star&#8217;d him in the face with looks amaz&#8217;d, <br />
As when she on Minerva&#8217;s secret gaz&#8217;d, <br />
And asks a mighty treasure for her hire; <br />
And, &#8217;till he brings it, makes the God retire. <br />
Minerva griev&#8217;d to see the nymph succeed; <br />
And now remembring the late impious deed, <br />
When, disobedient to her strict command, <br />
She touch&#8217;d the chest with an unhallow&#8217;d hand; <br />
In big-swoln sighs her inward rage express&#8217;d, <br />
That heav&#8217;d the rising Aegis on her breast; <br />
Then sought out Envy in her dark abode, <br />
Defil&#8217;d with ropy gore and clots of blood: <br />
Shut from the winds, and from the wholesome skies, <br />
In a deep vale the gloomy dungeon lies, <br />
Dismal and cold, where not a beam of light <br />
Invades the winter, or disturbs the night.</p>
<p>Directly to the cave her course she steer&#8217;d; <br />
Against the gates her martial lance she rear&#8217;d; <br />
The gates flew open, and the fiend appear&#8217;d. <br />
A pois&#8217;nous morsel in her teeth she chew&#8217;d, <br />
And gorg&#8217;d the flesh of vipers for her food. <br />
Minerva loathing turn&#8217;d away her eye; <br />
The hideous monster, rising heavily, <br />
Came stalking forward with a sullen pace, <br />
And left her mangled offals on the place. <br />
Soon as she saw the goddess gay and bright, <br />
She fetch&#8217;d a groan at such a chearful sight. <br />
Livid and meagre were her looks, her eye <br />
In foul distorted glances turn&#8217;d awry; <br />
A hoard of gall her inward parts possess&#8217;d, <br />
And spread a greenness o&#8217;er her canker&#8217;d breast; <br />
Her teeth were brown with rust, and from her tongue, <br />
In dangling drops, the stringy poison hung. <br />
She never smiles but when the wretched weep, <br />
Nor lulls her malice with a moment&#8217;s sleep, <br />
Restless in spite: while watchful to destroy, <br />
She pines and sickens at another&#8217;s joy; <br />
Foe to her self, distressing and distrest, <br />
She bears her own tormentor in her breast. <br />
The Goddess gave (for she abhorr&#8217;d her sight) <br />
A short command: &#8220;To Athens speed thy flight; <br />
On curst Aglauros try thy utmost art, <br />
And fix thy rankest venoms in her heart.&#8221; <br />
This said, her spear she push&#8217;d against the ground, <br />
And mounting from it with an active bound, <br />
Flew off to Heav&#8217;n: the hag with eyes askew <br />
Look&#8217;d up, and mutter&#8217;d curses as she flew; <br />
For sore she fretted, and began to grieve <br />
At the success which she her self must give. <br />
Then takes her staff, hung round with wreaths of thorn, <br />
And sails along, in a black whirlwind born, <br />
O&#8217;er fields and flow&#8217;ry meadows: where she steers <br />
Her baneful course, a mighty blast appears, <br />
Mildews and blights; the meadows are defac&#8217;d, <br />
The fields, the flow&#8217;rs, and the whole years laid waste: <br />
On mortals next, and peopled towns she falls, <br />
And breathes a burning plague among their walls.</p>
<p>When Athens she beheld, for arts renown&#8217;d, <br />
With peace made happy, and with plenty crown&#8217;d, <br />
Scarce could the hideous fiend from tears forbear, <br />
To find out nothing that deserv&#8217;d a tear. <br />
Th&#8217; apartment now she enter&#8217;d, where at rest <br />
Aglauros lay, with gentle sleep opprest. <br />
To execute Minerva&#8217;s dire command, <br />
She stroak&#8217;d the virgin with her canker&#8217;d hand, <br />
Then prickly thorns into her breast convey&#8217;d, <br />
That stung to madness the devoted maid: <br />
Her subtle venom still improves the smart, <br />
Frets in the blood, and festers in the heart.</p>
<p>To make the work more sure, a scene she drew, <br />
And plac&#8217;d before the dreaming virgin&#8217;s view <br />
Her sister&#8217;s marriage, and her glorious fate: <br />
Th&#8217; imaginary bride appears in state; <br />
The bride-groom with unwonted beauty glows: <br />
For envy magnifies what-e&#8217;er she shows.</p>
<p>Full of the dream, Aglauros pin&#8217;d away <br />
In tears all night, in darkness all the day; <br />
Consum&#8217;d like ice, that just begins to run, <br />
When feebly smitten by the distant sun; <br />
Or like unwholsome weeds, that set on fire <br />
Are slowly wasted, and in smoke expire. <br />
Giv&#8217;n up to envy (for in ev&#8217;ry thought <br />
The thorns, the venom, and the vision wrought) <br />
Oft did she call on death, as oft decreed, <br />
Rather than see her sister&#8217;s wish succeed, <br />
To tell her awfull father what had past: <br />
At length before the door her self she cast; <br />
And, sitting on the ground with sullen pride, <br />
A passage to the love-sick God deny&#8217;d. <br />
The God caress&#8217;d, and for admission pray&#8217;d, <br />
And sooth&#8217;d in softest words th&#8217; envenom&#8217;d maid. <br />
In vain he sooth&#8217;d: &#8220;Begone!&#8221; the maid replies, <br />
&#8220;Or here I keep my seat, and never rise.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Then keep thy seat for ever,&#8221; cries the God, <br />
And touch&#8217;d the door, wide op&#8217;ning to his rod. <br />
Fain would she rise, and stop him, but she found <br />
Her trunk too heavy to forsake the ground; <br />
Her joynts are all benum&#8217;d, her hands are pale, <br />
And marble now appears in ev&#8217;ry nail. <br />
As when a cancer in the body feeds, <br />
And gradual death from limb to limb proceeds; <br />
So does the chilness to each vital parte <br />
Spread by degrees, and creeps into her heart; <br />
&#8216;Till hard&#8217;ning ev&#8217;ry where, and speechless grown, <br />
She sits unmov&#8217;d, and freezes to a stone. <br />
But still her envious hue and sullen mien <br />
Are in the sedentary figure seen.</p>
<p>Europa&#8217;s Rape</p>
<p>When now the God his fury had allay&#8217;d, <br />
And taken vengeance of the stubborn maid, <br />
From where the bright Athenian turrets rise <br />
He mounts aloft, and re-ascends the skies. <br />
Jove saw him enter the sublime abodes, <br />
And, as he mix&#8217;d among the crowd of Gods, <br />
Beckon&#8217;d him out, and drew him from the rest, <br />
And in soft whispers thus his will exprest.</p>
<p>&#8220;My trusty Hermes, by whose ready aid <br />
Thy sire&#8217;s commands are through the world convey&#8217;d. <br />
Resume thy wings, exert their utmost force, <br />
And to the walls of Sidon speed thy course; <br />
There find a herd of heifers wand&#8217;ring o&#8217;er <br />
The neighb&#8217;ring hill, and drive &#8216;em to the shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus spoke the God, concealing his intent. <br />
The trusty Hermes, on his message went, <br />
And found the herd of heifers wand&#8217;ring o&#8217;er <br />
A neighb&#8217;ring hill, and drove &#8216;em to the shore; <br />
Where the king&#8217;s daughter, with a lovely train <br />
Of fellow-nymphs, was sporting on the plain.</p>
<p>The dignity of empire laid aside, <br />
(For love but ill agrees with kingly pride) <br />
The ruler of the skies, the thund&#8217;ring God, <br />
Who shakes the world&#8217;s foundations with a nod, <br />
Among a herd of lowing heifers ran, <br />
Frisk&#8217;d in a bull, and bellow&#8217;d o&#8217;er the plain. <br />
Large rowles of fat about his shoulders clung, <br />
And from his neck the double dewlap hung. <br />
His skin was whiter than the snow that lies <br />
Unsully&#8217;d by the breath of southern skies; <br />
Small shining horns on his curl&#8217;d forehead stand, <br />
As turn&#8217;d and polish&#8217;d by the work-man&#8217;s hand; <br />
His eye-balls rowl&#8217;d, not formidably bright, <br />
But gaz&#8217;d and languish&#8217;d with a gentle light. <br />
His ev&#8217;ry look was peaceful, and exprest <br />
The softness of the lover in the beast.</p>
<p>Agenor&#8217;s royal daughter, as she plaid <br />
Among the fields, the milk-white bull survey&#8217;d, <br />
And view&#8217;d his spotless body with delight, <br />
And at a distance kept him in her sight. <br />
At length she pluck&#8217;d the rising flow&#8217;rs, and fed <br />
The gentle beast, and fondly stroak&#8217;d his head. <br />
He stood well-pleas&#8217;d to touch the charming fair, <br />
But hardly could confine his pleasure there. <br />
And now he wantons o&#8217;er the neighb&#8217;ring strand, <br />
Now rowls his body on the yellow sand; <br />
And, now perceiving all her fears decay&#8217;d, <br />
Comes tossing forward to the royal maid; <br />
Gives her his breast to stroke, and downward turns <br />
His grizly brow, and gently stoops his horns. <br />
In flow&#8217;ry wreaths the royal virgin drest <br />
His bending horns, and kindly clapt his breast. <br />
&#8216;Till now grown wanton and devoid of fear, <br />
Not knowing that she prest the Thunderer, <br />
She plac&#8217;d her self upon his back, and rode <br />
O&#8217;er fields and meadows, seated on the God.</p>
<p>He gently march&#8217;d along, and by degrees <br />
Left the dry meadow, and approach&#8217;d the seas; <br />
Where now he dips his hoofs and wets his thighs, <br />
Now plunges in, and carries off the prize. <br />
The frighted nymph looks backward on the shoar, <br />
And hears the tumbling billows round her roar; <br />
But still she holds him fast: one hand is born <br />
Upon his back; the other grasps a horn: <br />
Her train of ruffling garments flies behind, <br />
Swells in the air, and hovers in the wind.</p>
<p>Through storms and tempests he the virgin bore, <br />
And lands her safe on the Dictean shore; <br />
Where now, in his divinest form array&#8217;d, <br />
In his true shape he captivates the maid; <br />
Who gazes on him, and with wond&#8217;ring eyes <br />
Beholds the new majestick figure rise, <br />
His glowing features, and celestial light, <br />
And all the God discover&#8217;d to her sight. </p>
