				<p>BOOK XVI</p>
<p>MEANWHILE Ulysses and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and<br />
were were getting breakfast ready at daybreak for they had sent the<br />
men out with the pigs. When Telemachus came up, the dogs did not bark,<br />
but fawned upon him, so Ulysses, hearing the sound of feet and<br />
noticing that the dogs did not bark, said to Eumaeus:<br />
&#8220;Eumaeus, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one of<br />
your acquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning urn him and<br />
not barking.&#8221;<br />
The words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at the<br />
door. Eumaeus sprang to his feet, and the bowls in which he was mixing<br />
wine fell from his hands, as he made towards his master. He kissed his<br />
head and both his beautiful eyes, and wept for joy. A father could not<br />
be more delighted at the return of an only son, the child of his old<br />
age, after ten years&#8217; absence in a foreign country and after having<br />
gone through much hardship. He embraced him, kissed him all over as<br />
though he had come back from the dead, and spoke fondly to him saying:<br />
&#8220;So you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. When<br />
I heard you had gone to Pylos I made sure I was never going to see you<br />
any more. Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I may have a good<br />
look at you now you are home again; it is not very often you come into<br />
the country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to the town<br />
generally. I suppose you think it better to keep an eye on what the<br />
suitors are doing.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;So be it, old friend,&#8221; answered Telemachus, &#8220;but I am come now<br />
because I want to see you, and to learn whether my mother is still<br />
at her old home or whether some one else has married her, so that<br />
the bed of Ulysses is without bedding and covered with cobwebs.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;She is still at the house,&#8221; replied Eumaeus, &#8220;grieving and breaking<br />
her heart, and doing nothing but weep, both night and day<br />
continually.&#8221;<br />
As spoke he took Telemachus&#8217; spear, whereon he crossed the stone<br />
threshold and came inside. Ulysses rose from his seat to give him<br />
place as he entered, but Telemachus checked him; &#8220;Sit down, stranger.&#8221;<br />
said he, &#8220;I can easily find another seat, and there is one here who<br />
will lay it for me.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses went back to his own place, and Eumaeus strewed some green<br />
brushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for<br />
Telemachus to sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters of<br />
cold meat, the remains from what they had eaten the day before, and he<br />
filled the bread baskets with bread as fast as he could. He mixed wine<br />
also in bowls of ivy-wood, and took his seat facing Ulysses. Then they<br />
laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon<br />
as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus said to Eumaeus,<br />
&#8220;Old friend, where does this stranger come from? How did his crew<br />
bring him to Ithaca, and who were they?-for assuredly he did not<br />
come here by land&#8221;&#8216;<br />
To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, &#8220;My son, I will tell<br />
you the real truth. He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been a<br />
great traveller. At this moment he is running away from a<br />
Thesprotian ship, and has refuge at my station, so I will put him into<br />
your hands. Do whatever you like with him, only remember that he is<br />
your suppliant.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I am very much distressed,&#8221; said Telemachus, &#8220;by what you have just<br />
told me. How can I take this stranger into my house? I am as yet<br />
young, and am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacks<br />
me. My mother cannot make up her mind whether to stay where she is and<br />
look after the house out of respect for public opinion and the<br />
memory of her husband, or whether the time is now come for her to take<br />
the best man of those who are wooing her, and the one who will make<br />
her the most advantageous offer; still, as the stranger has come to<br />
your station I will find him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a<br />
sword and sandals, and will send him wherever he wants to go. Or if<br />
you like you can keep him here at the station, and I will send him<br />
clothes and food that he may be no burden on you and on your men;<br />
but I will not have him go near the suitors, for they are very<br />
insolent, and are sure to ill-treat him in a way that would greatly<br />
grieve me; no matter how valiant a man may be he can do nothing<br />
against numbers, for they will be too strong for him.&#8221;<br />
Then Ulysses said, &#8220;Sir, it is right that I should say something<br />
myself. I am much shocked about what you have said about the<br />
insolent way in which the suitors are behaving in despite of such a<br />
man as you are. Tell me, do you submit to such treatment tamely, or<br />
has some god set your people against you? May you not complain of your<br />
brothers- for it is to these that a man may look for support,<br />
however great his quarrel may be? I wish I were as young as you are<br />
and in my present mind; if I were son to Ulysses, or, indeed,<br />
Ulysses himself, I would rather some one came and cut my head off, but<br />
I would go to the house and be the bane of every one of these men.<br />
If they were too many for me- I being single-handed- I would rather<br />
die fighting in my own house than see such disgraceful sights day<br />
after day, strangers grossly maltreated, and men dragging the women<br />
servants about the house in an unseemly way, wine drawn recklessly,<br />
and bread wasted all to no purpose for an end that shall never be<br />
accomplished.&#8221;<br />
And Telemachus answered, &#8220;I will tell you truly everything. There is<br />
no emnity between me and my people, nor can I complain of brothers, to<br />
whom a man may look for support however great his quarrel may be. Jove<br />
has made us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of<br />
Arceisius, and Ulysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the only son<br />
of Ulysses who left me behind him when he went away, so that I have<br />
never been of any use to him. Hence it comes that my house is in the<br />
hands of numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all the<br />
neighbouring islands, Dulichium, Same, Zacynthus, as also all the<br />
principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the<br />
pretext of paying court to my mother, who will neither say point blank<br />
that she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end, so they<br />
are making havoc of my estate, and before long will do so with<br />
myself into the bargain. The issue, however, rests with heaven. But do<br />
you, old friend Eumaeus, go at once and tell Penelope that I am safe<br />
and have returned from Pylos. Tell it to herself alone, and then<br />
come back here without letting any one else know, for there are many<br />
who are plotting mischief against me.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I understand and heed you,&#8221; replied Eumaeus; &#8220;you need instruct<br />
me no further, only I am going that way say whether I had not better<br />
let poor Laertes know that you are returned. He used to superintend<br />
the work on his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about Ulysses,<br />
and he would eat and drink at will along with his servants; but they<br />
tell me that from the day on which you set out for Pylos he has<br />
neither eaten nor drunk as he ought to do, nor does he look after<br />
his farm, but sits weeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;More&#8217;s the pity,&#8221; answered Telemachus, &#8220;I am sorry for him, but<br />
we must leave him to himself just now. If people could have everything<br />
their own way, the first thing I should choose would be the return<br />
of my father; but go, and give your message; then make haste back<br />
again, and do not turn out of your way to tell Laertes. Tell my mother<br />
to send one of her women secretly with the news at once, and let him<br />
hear it from her.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took his<br />
sandals, bound them to his feet, and started for the town. Minerva<br />
watched him well off the station, and then came up to it in the form<br />
of a woman- fair, stately, and wise. She stood against the side of the<br />
entry, and revealed herself to Ulysses, but Telemachus could not see<br />
her, and knew not that she was there, for the gods do not let<br />
themselves be seen by everybody. Ulysses saw her, and so did the dogs,<br />
for they did not bark, but went scared and whining off to the other<br />
side of the yards. She nodded her head and motioned to Ulysses with<br />
her eyebrows; whereon he left the hut and stood before her outside the<br />
main wall of the yards. Then she said to him:<br />
&#8220;Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you to tell<br />
your son: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans<br />
for the destruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I will<br />
not be long in joining you, for I too am eager for the fray.&#8221;<br />
As she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw a<br />
fair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him<br />
younger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour,<br />
filled out his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. Then she<br />
went away and Ulysses came back inside the hut. His son was<br />
astounded when he saw him, and turned his eyes away for fear he<br />
might be looking upon a god.<br />
&#8220;Stranger,&#8221; said he, &#8220;how suddenly you have changed from what you<br />
were a moment or two ago. You are dressed differently and your<br />
colour is not the same. Are you some one or other of the gods that<br />
live in heaven? If so, be propitious to me till I can make you due<br />
sacrifice and offerings of wrought gold. Have mercy upon me.&#8221;<br />
And Ulysses said, &#8220;I am no god, why should you take me for one? I am<br />
your father, on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at the<br />
hands of lawless men.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on<br />
to the ground, for he had restrained all tears till now. but<br />
Telemachus could not yet believe that it was his father, and said:<br />
&#8220;You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain<br />
hopes that I may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could of<br />
himself contrive to do as you have been doing, and make yourself old<br />
and young at a moment&#8217;s notice, unless a god were with him. A second<br />
ago you were old and all in rags, and now you are like some god come<br />
down from heaven.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses answered, &#8220;Telemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurably<br />
astonished at my being really here. There is no other Ulysses who will<br />
come hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, who after long wandering and<br />
much hardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country.<br />
What you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Minerva, who<br />
does with me whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases. At<br />
one moment she makes me like a beggar, and the next I am a young man<br />
with good clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods who<br />
live in heaven to make any man look either rich or poor.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw his arms about his<br />
father and wept. They were both so much moved that they cried aloud<br />
like eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of<br />
their half fledged young by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep,<br />
and the sun would have gone down upon their mourning if Telemachus had<br />
not suddenly said, &#8220;In what ship, my dear father, did your crew<br />
bring you to Ithaca? Of what nation did they declare themselves to be-<br />
for you cannot have come by land?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I will tell you the truth, my son,&#8221; replied Ulysses. &#8220;It was the<br />
Phaeacians who brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in the<br />
habit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. They took<br />
me over the sea while I was fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca,<br />
after giving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. These<br />
things by heaven&#8217;s mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I am now<br />
come here on the suggestion of Minerva that we may consult about<br />
killing our enemies. First, therefore, give me a list of the<br />
suitors, with their number, that I may learn who, and how many, they<br />
are. I can then turn the matter over in my mind, and see whether we<br />
two can fight the whole body of them ourselves, or whether we must<br />
find others to help us.&#8221;<br />
To this Telemachus answered, &#8220;Father, I have always heard of your<br />
renown both in the field and in council, but the task you talk of is a<br />
very great one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men cannot<br />
stand against many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors only, nor<br />
twice ten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their number at<br />
once. There are fifty-two chosen youths from Dulichium, and they<br />
have six servants; from Same there are twenty-four; twenty young<br />
Achaeans from Zacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all of them<br />
well born. They have with them a servant Medon, a bard, and two men<br />
who can carve at table. If we face such numbers as this, you may<br />
have bitter cause to rue your coming, and your revenge. See whether<br />
you cannot think of some one who would be willing to come and help<br />
us.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; replied Ulysses, &#8220;and think whether Minerva and<br />
her father Jove may seem sufficient, or whether I am to try and find<br />
some one else as well.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Those whom you have named,&#8221; answered Telemachus, &#8220;are a couple of<br />
good allies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds they<br />
have power over both gods and men.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;These two,&#8221; continued Ulysses, &#8220;will not keep long out of the fray,<br />
when the suitors and we join fight in my house. Now, therefore, return<br />
home early to-morrow morning, and go about among the suitors as<br />
before. Later on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguised<br />
as a miserable old beggar. If you see them ill-treating me, steel your<br />
heart against my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost<br />
out of the house, or throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyond<br />
gently trying to make them behave more reasonably; but they will not<br />
listen to you, for the day of their reckoning is at hand.<br />
Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, when Minerva shall<br />
put it in my mind, I will nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this<br />
you must collect all the armour that is in the house and hide it in<br />
the strong store room. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why<br />
you are removing it; say that you have taken it to be out of the way<br />
of the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses<br />
went away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this<br />
more particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to<br />
quarrel over their wine, and that they may do each other some harm<br />
which may disgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms<br />
sometimes tempts people to use them. But leave a sword and a spear<br />
apiece for yourself and me, and a couple oxhide shields so that we can<br />
snatch them up at any moment; Jove and Minerva will then soon quiet<br />
these people. There is also another matter; if you are indeed my son<br />
and my blood runs in your veins, let no one know that Ulysses is<br />
within the house- neither Laertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor any of<br />
the servants, nor even Penelope herself. Let you and me exploit the<br />
women alone, and let us also make trial of some other of the men<br />
servants, to see who is on our side and whose hand is against us.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Father,&#8221; replied Telemachus, &#8220;you will come to know me by and by,<br />
and when you do you will find that I can keep your counsel. I do not<br />
think, however, the plan you propose will turn out well for either<br />
of us. Think it over. It will take us a long time to go the round of<br />
the farms and exploit the men, and all the time the suitors will be<br />
wasting your estate with impunity and without compunction. Prove the<br />
women by all means, to see who are disloyal and who guiltless, but I<br />
am not in favour of going round and trying the men. We can attend to<br />
that later on, if you really have some sign from Jove that he will<br />
support you.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought<br />
Telemachus and his crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca.<br />
When they had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to the<br />
land; their servants came and took their armour from them, and they<br />
left all the presents at the house of Clytius. Then they sent a<br />
servant to tell Penelope that Telemachus had gone into the country,<br />
but had sent the ship to the town to prevent her from being alarmed<br />
and made unhappy. This servant and Eumaeus happened to meet when<br />
they were both on the same errand of going to tell Penelope. When they<br />
reached the House, the servant stood up and said to the queen in the<br />
presence of the waiting women, &#8220;Your son, Madam, is now returned<br />
from Pylos&#8221;; but Eumaeus went close up to Penelope, and said privately<br />
that her son had given bidden him tell her. When he had given his<br />
message he left the house with its outbuildings and went back to his<br />
pigs again.<br />
The suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so they<br />
went outside the great wall that ran round the outer court, and held a<br />
council near the main entrance. Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the<br />
first to speak.<br />
&#8220;My friends,&#8221; said he, &#8220;this voyage of Telemachus&#8217;s is a very<br />
serious matter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing. Now,<br />
however, let us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew together to<br />
send after the others and tell them to come back as fast as they can.&#8221;<br />
He had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his place<br />
and saw the ship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails,<br />
and putting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to the others,<br />
&#8220;We need not send them any message, for they are here. Some god must<br />
have told them, or else they saw the ship go by, and could not<br />
overtake her.<br />
On this they rose and went to the water side. The crew then drew the<br />
ship on shore; their servants took their armour from them, and they<br />
went up in a body to the place of assembly, but they would not let any<br />
one old or young sit along with them, and Antinous, son of<br />
Eupeithes, spoke first.<br />
&#8220;Good heavens,&#8221; said he, &#8220;see how the gods have saved this man<br />
from destruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands<br />
all day long, and when the sun was down we never went on shore to<br />
sleep, but waited in the ship all night till morning in the hope of<br />
capturing and killing him; but some god has conveyed him home in spite<br />
of us. Let us consider how we can make an end of him. He must not<br />
escape us; our affair is never likely to come off while is alive,<br />
for he is very shrewd, and public feeling is by no means all on our<br />
side. We must make haste before he can call the Achaeans in<br />
assembly; he will lose no time in doing so, for he will be furious<br />
with us, and will tell all the world how we plotted to kill him, but<br />
failed to take him. The people will not like this when they come to<br />
know of it; we must see that they do us no hurt, nor drive us from our<br />
own country into exile. Let us try and lay hold of him either on his<br />
farm away from the town, or on the road hither. Then we can divide<br />
up his property amongst us, and let his mother and the man who marries<br />
her have the house. If this does not please you, and you wish<br />
Telemachus to live on and hold his father&#8217;s property, then we must not<br />
gather here and eat up his goods in this way, but must make our offers<br />
to Penelope each from his own house, and she can marry the man who<br />
will give the most for her, and whose lot it is to win her.&#8221;<br />
They all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was the<br />
son of Nisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost among<br />
all the suitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island of<br />
Dulichium; his conversation, moreover, was more agreeable to<br />
Penelope than that of any of the other for he was a man of good<br />
natural disposition. &#8220;My friends,&#8221; said he, speaking to them plainly<br />
and in all honestly, &#8220;I am not in favour of killing Telemachus. It<br />
is a heinous thing to kill one who is of noble blood. Let us first<br />
take counsel of the gods, and if the oracles of Jove advise it, I will<br />
both help to kill him myself, and will urge everyone else to do so;<br />
but if they dissuade us, I would have you hold your hands.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they rose<br />
forthwith and went to the house of Ulysses where they took their<br />
accustomed seats.<br />
Then Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors.<br />
She knew of the plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had<br />
overheard their counsels and had told her; she went down therefore<br />
to the court attended by her maidens, and when she reached the suitors<br />
she stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the<br />
cloister holding a veil before her face, and rebuked Antinous saying:<br />
&#8220;Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best<br />
speaker and counsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you<br />
are nothing of the kind. Madman, why should you try to compass the<br />
death of Telemachus, and take no heed of suppliants, whose witness<br />
is Jove himself? It is not right for you to plot thus against one<br />
another. Do you not remember how your father fled to this house in<br />
fear of the people, who were enraged against him for having gone<br />
with some Taphian pirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at<br />
peace with us? They wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything<br />
he had, but Ulysses stayed their hands although they were<br />
infuriated, and now you devour his property without paying for it, and<br />
break my heart by his wooing his wife and trying to kill his son.<br />
Leave off doing so, and stop the others also.&#8221;<br />
To this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, &#8220;Take heart, Queen<br />
Penelope daughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself about<br />
these matters. The man is not yet born, nor never will be, who shall<br />
lay hands upon your son Telemachus, while I yet live to look upon<br />
the face of the earth. I say- and it shall surely be- that my spear<br />
shall be reddened with his blood; for many a time has Ulysses taken me<br />
on his knees, held wine up to my lips to drink, and put pieces of meat<br />
into my hands. Therefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have,<br />
and has nothing to fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if<br />
death comes to him from the gods, he cannot escape it.&#8221; He said this<br />
to quiet her, but in reality he was plotting against Telemachus.<br />
Then Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till<br />
Minerva shed sleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back to<br />
Ulysses and his son, who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old<br />
and were ready; helping one another to get supper ready; Minerva<br />
therefore came up to Ulysses, turned him into an old man with a stroke<br />
of her wand, and clad him in his old clothes again, for fear that<br />
the swineherd might recognize him and not keep the secret, but go<br />
and tell Penelope.<br />
Telemachus was the first to speak. &#8220;So you have got back,<br />
Eumaeus,&#8221; said he. &#8220;What is the news of the town? Have the suitors<br />
returned, or are they still waiting over yonder, to take me on my<br />
way home?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I did not think of asking about that,&#8221; replied Eumaeus, &#8220;when I was<br />
in the town. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon<br />
as I could. I met a man sent by those who had gone with you to<br />
Pylos, and he was the first to tell the new your mother, but I can say<br />
what I saw with my own eyes; I had just got on to the crest of the<br />
hill of Mercury above the town when I saw a ship coming into harbour<br />
with a number of men in her. They had many shields and spears, and I<br />
thought it was the suitors, but I cannot be sure.&#8221;<br />
On hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeus<br />
could not see him.<br />
Then, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, they<br />
ate it, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied.<br />
As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to<br />
rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.</p>
<p>
BOOK XVII</p>
<p>WHEN the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,<br />
Telemachus bound on his sandals and took a strong spear that suited<br />
his hands, for he wanted to go into the city. &#8220;Old friend,&#8221; said he to<br />
the swineherd, &#8220;I will now go to the town and show myself to my<br />
mother, for she will never leave off grieving till she has seen me. As<br />
for this unfortunate stranger, take him to the town and let him beg<br />
there of any one who will give him a drink and a piece of bread. I<br />
have trouble enough of my own, and cannot be burdened with other<br />
people. If this makes him angry so much the worse for him, but I<br />
like to say what I mean.&#8221;<br />
Then Ulysses said, &#8220;Sir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar can<br />
always do better in town than country, for any one who likes can<br />
give him something. I am too old to care about remaining here at the<br />
beck and call of a master. Therefore let this man do as you have<br />
just told him, and take me to the town as soon as I have had a warm by<br />
the fire, and the day has got a little heat in it. My clothes are<br />
wretchedly thin, and this frosty morning I shall be perished with<br />
cold, for you say the city is some way off.&#8221;<br />
On this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his<br />
revenge upon the When he reached home he stood his spear against a<br />
bearing-post of the cloister, crossed the stone floor of the<br />
cloister itself, and went inside.<br />
Nurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting<br />
the fleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up to<br />
him; all the other maids came up too, and covered his head and<br />
shoulders with their kisses. Penelope came out of her room looking<br />
like Diana or Venus, and wept as she flung her arms about her son. She<br />
kissed his forehead and both his beautiful eyes, &#8220;Light of my eyes,&#8221;<br />
she cried as she spoke fondly to him, &#8220;so you are come home again; I<br />
made sure I was never going to see you any more. To think of your<br />
having gone off to Pylos without saying anything about it or obtaining<br />
my consent. But come, tell me what you saw.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Do not scold me, mother,&#8217; answered Telemachus, &#8220;nor vex me,<br />
seeing what a narrow escape I have had, but wash your face, change<br />
your dress, go upstairs with your maids, and promise full and<br />
sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if Jove will only grant us our<br />
revenge upon the suitors. I must now go to the place of assembly to<br />
invite a stranger who has come back with me from Pylos. I sent him<br />
on with my crew, and told Piraeus to take him home and look after<br />
him till I could come for him myself.&#8221;<br />
She heeded her son&#8217;s words, washed her face, changed her dress,<br />
and vowed full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if they<br />
would only vouchsafe her revenge upon the suitors.<br />
Telemachus went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand-<br />
not alone, for his two fleet dogs went with him. Minerva endowed him<br />
with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as<br />
he went by, and the suitors gathered round him with fair words in<br />
their mouths and malice in their hearts; but he avoided them, and went<br />
to sit with Mentor, Antiphus, and Halitherses, old friends of his<br />
father&#8217;s house, and they made him tell them all that had happened to<br />
him. Then Piraeus came up with Theoclymenus, whom he had escorted<br />
through the town to the place of assembly, whereon Telemachus at<br />
once joined them. Piraeus was first to speak: &#8220;Telemachus,&#8221; said he,<br />
&#8220;I wish you would send some of your women to my house to take awa<br />
the presents Menelaus gave you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;We do not know, Piraeus,&#8221; answered Telemachus, &#8220;what may happen. If<br />
the suitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among them,<br />
I would rather you had the presents than that any of those people<br />
should get hold of them. If on the other hand I manage to kill them, I<br />
shall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents.&#8221;<br />
With these words he took Theoclymenus to his own house. When they<br />
got there they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats, went into<br />
the baths, and washed themselves. When the maids had washed and<br />
anointed them, and had given them cloaks and shirts, they took their<br />
seats at table. A maid servant then brought them water in a<br />
beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them to<br />
wash their hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper<br />
servant brought them bread and offered them many good things of what<br />
there was in the house. Opposite them sat Penelope, reclining on a<br />
couch by one of the bearing-posts of the cloister, and spinning.<br />
Then they laid their hands on the good things that were before them,<br />
and as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Penelope said:<br />
&#8220;Telemachus, I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch,<br />
which I have not ceased to water with my tears, from the day Ulysses<br />
set out for Troy with the sons of Atreus. You failed, however, to make<br />
it clear to me before the suitors came back to the house, whether or<br />
no you had been able to hear anything about the return of your<br />
father.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I will tell you then truth,&#8221; replied her son. &#8220;We went to Pylos and<br />
saw Nestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably as<br />
though I were a son of his own who had just returned after a long<br />
absence; so also did his sons; but he said he had not heard a word<br />
from any human being about Ulysses, whether he was alive or dead. He<br />
sent me, therefore, with a chariot and horses to Menelaus. There I saw<br />
Helen, for whose sake so many, both Argives and Trojans, were in<br />
heaven&#8217;s wisdom doomed to suffer. Menelaus asked me what it was that<br />
had brought me to Lacedaemon, and I told him the whole truth,<br />
whereon he said, &#8216;So, then, these cowards would usurp a brave man&#8217;s<br />
bed? A hind might as well lay her new-born young in the lair of a<br />
lion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell.<br />
The lion, when he comes back to his lair, will make short work with<br />
the pair of them, and so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father<br />
Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was<br />
when he wrestled with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so<br />
heavily that all the Greeks cheered him- if he is still such, and were<br />
to come near these suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry<br />
wedding. As regards your question, however, I will not prevaricate nor<br />
deceive you, but what the old man of the sea told me, so much will I<br />
tell you in full. He said he could see Ulysses on an island<br />
sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso, who was<br />
keeping him prisoner, and he could not reach his home, for he had no<br />
ships nor sailors to take him over the sea.&#8217; This was what Menelaus<br />
told me, and when I had heard his story I came away; the gods then<br />
gave me a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again.&#8221;<br />
With these words he moved the heart of Penelope. Then Theoclymenus<br />
said to her:<br />
&#8220;Madam, wife of Ulysses, Telemachus does not understand these<br />
things; listen therefore to me, for I can divine them surely, and will<br />
hide nothing from you. May Jove the king of heaven be my witness,<br />
and the rites of hospitality, with that hearth of Ulysses to which I<br />
now come, that Ulysses himself is even now in Ithaca, and, either<br />
going about the country or staying in one place, is enquiring into all<br />
these evil deeds and preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. I<br />
saw an omen when I was on the ship which meant this, and I told<br />
Telemachus about it.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;May it be even so,&#8221; answered Penelope; &#8220;if your words come true,<br />
you shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who<br />
see you shall congratulate you.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs,<br />
or aiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of the<br />
house, and behaving with all their old insolence. But when it was<br />
now time for dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come into<br />
the town from all the country round, with their shepherds as usual,<br />
then Medon, who was their favourite servant, and who waited upon<br />
them at table, said, &#8220;Now then, my young masters, you have had<br />
enough sport, so come inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner is<br />
not a bad thing, at dinner time.&#8221;<br />
They left their sports as he told them, and when they were within<br />
the house, they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside, and<br />
then sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of them fat<br />
and well grown. Thus they made ready for their meal. In the meantime<br />
Ulysses and the swineherd were about starting for the town, and the<br />
swineherd said, &#8220;Stranger, I suppose you still want to go to town<br />
to-day, as my master said you were to do; for my own part I should<br />
have liked you to stay here as a station hand, but I must do as my<br />
master tells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding from<br />
one&#8217;s master is a very serious thing. Let us then be off, for it is<br />
now broad day; it will be night again directly and then you will<br />
find it colder.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I know, and understand you,&#8221; replied Ulysses; &#8220;you need say no<br />
more. Let us be going, but if you have a stick ready cut, let me<br />
have it to walk with, for you say the road is a very rough one.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his<br />
shoulders, by the cord from which it hung, and Eumaeus gave him a<br />
stick to his liking. The two then started, leaving the station in<br />
charge of the dogs and herdsmen who remained behind; the swineherd led<br />
the way and his master followed after, looking like some broken-down<br />
old tramp as he leaned upon his staff, and his clothes were all in<br />
rags. When they had got over the rough steep ground and were nearing<br />
the city, they reached the fountain from which the citizens drew their<br />
water. This had been made by Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyctor. There was<br />
a grove of water-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it,<br />
and the clear cold water came down to it from a rock high up, while<br />
above the fountain there was an altar to the nymphs, at which all<br />
wayfarers used to sacrifice. Here Melanthius son of Dolius overtook<br />
them as he was driving down some goats, the best in his flock, for the<br />
suitors&#8217; dinner, and there were two shepherds with him. When he saw<br />
Eumaeus and Ulysses he reviled them with outrageous and unseemly<br />
language, which made Ulysses very angry.<br />
&#8220;There you go,&#8221; cried he, &#8220;and a precious pair you are. See how<br />
heaven brings birds of the same feather to one another. Where, pray,<br />
master swineherd, are you taking this poor miserable object? It<br />
would make any one sick to see such a creature at table. A fellow like<br />
this never won a prize for anything in his life, but will go about<br />
rubbing his shoulders against every man&#8217;s door post, and begging,<br />
not for swords and cauldrons like a man, but only for a few scraps not<br />
worth begging for. If you would give him to me for a hand on my<br />
station, he might do to clean out the folds, or bring a bit of sweet<br />
feed to the kids, and he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleased<br />
on whey; but he has taken to bad ways and will not go about any kind<br />
of work; he will do nothing but beg victuals all the town over, to<br />
feed his insatiable belly. I say, therefore and it shall surely be- if<br />
he goes near Ulysses&#8217; house he will get his head broken by the<br />
stools they will fling at him, till they turn him out.&#8221;<br />
On this, as he passed, he gave Ulysses a kick on the hip out of pure<br />
wantonness, but Ulysses stood firm, and did not budge from the path.<br />
For a moment he doubted whether or no to fly at Melanthius and kill<br />
him with his staff, or fling him to the ground and beat his brains<br />
out; he resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself in check, but<br />
the swineherd looked straight at Melanthius and rebuked him, lifting<br />
up his hands and praying to heaven as he did so.<br />
&#8220;Fountain nymphs,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;children of Jove, if ever Ulysses<br />
burned you thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids,<br />
grant my prayer that heaven may send him home. He would soon put an<br />
end to the swaggering threats with which such men as you go about<br />
insulting people-gadding all over the town while your flocks are going<br />
to ruin through bad shepherding.&#8221;<br />
Then Melanthius the goatherd answered, &#8220;You ill-conditioned cur,<br />
what are you talking about? Some day or other I will put you on<br />
board ship and take you to a foreign country, where I can sell you and<br />
pocket the money you will fetch. I wish I were as sure that Apollo<br />
would strike Telemachus dead this very day, or that the suitors<br />
would kill him, as I am that Ulysses will never come home again.&#8221;<br />
With this he left them to come on at their leisure, while he went<br />
quickly forward and soon reached the house of his master. When he<br />
got there he went in and took his seat among the suitors opposite<br />
Eurymachus, who liked him better than any of the others. The<br />
servants brought him a portion of meat, and an upper woman servant set<br />
bread before him that he might eat. Presently Ulysses and the<br />
swineherd came up to the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music,<br />
for Phemius was just beginning to sing to the suitors. Then Ulysses<br />
took hold of the swineherd&#8217;s hand, and said:<br />
&#8220;Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. No matter<br />
how far you go you will find few like it. One building keeps following<br />
on after another. The outer court has a wall with battlements all<br />
round it; the doors are double folding, and of good workmanship; it<br />
would be a hard matter to take it by force of arms. I perceive, too,<br />
that there are many people banqueting within it, for there is a<br />
smell of roast meat, and I hear a sound of music, which the gods<br />
have made to go along with feasting.&#8221;<br />
Then Eumaeus said, &#8220;You have perceived aright, as indeed you<br />
generally do; but let us think what will be our best course. Will<br />
you go inside first and join the suitors, leaving me here behind<br />
you, or will you wait here and let me go in first? But do not wait<br />
long, or some one may you loitering about outside, and throw something<br />
at you. Consider this matter I pray you.&#8221;<br />
And Ulysses answered, &#8220;I understand and heed. Go in first and<br />
leave me here where I am. I am quite used to being beaten and having<br />
things thrown at me. I have been so much buffeted about in war and<br />
by sea that I am case-hardened, and this too may go with the rest. But<br />
a man cannot hide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an<br />
enemy which gives much trouble to all men; it is because of this<br />
that ships are fitted out to sail the seas, and to make war upon other<br />
people.&#8221;<br />
As they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised<br />
his head and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Ulysses had<br />
bred before setting out for Troy, but he had never had any work out of<br />
him. In the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when<br />
they went hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his<br />
master was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow<br />
dung that lay in front of the stable doors till the men should come<br />
and draw it away to manure the great close; and he was full of<br />
fleas. As soon as he saw Ulysses standing there, he dropped his ears<br />
and wagged his tail, but he could not get close up to his master. When<br />
Ulysses saw the dog on the other side of the yard, dashed a tear<br />
from his eyes without Eumaeus seeing it, and said:<br />
&#8220;Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap:<br />
his build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he<br />
only one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept<br />
merely for show?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;This hound,&#8221; answered Eumaeus, &#8220;belonged to him who has died in a<br />
far country. If he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he<br />
would soon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in<br />
the forest that could get away from him when he was once on its<br />
tracks. But now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead<br />
and gone, and the women take no care of him. Servants never do their<br />
work when their master&#8217;s hand is no longer over them, for Jove takes<br />
half the goodness out of a man when he makes a slave of him.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the<br />
suitors were, but Argos died as soon as he had recognized his master.<br />
Telemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned<br />
him to come and sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat<br />
lying near where the carver sat serving out their portions to the<br />
suitors; he picked it up, brought it to Telemachus&#8217;s table, and sat<br />
down opposite him. Then the servant brought him his portion, and<br />
gave him bread from the bread-basket.<br />
Immediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor<br />
miserable old beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in<br />
rags. He sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors<br />
leading from the outer to the inner court, and against a<br />
bearing-post of cypress-wood which the carpenter had skillfully<br />
planed, and had made to join truly with rule and line. Telemachus took<br />
a whole loaf from the bread-basket, with as much meat as he could hold<br />
in his two hands, and said to Eumaeus, &#8220;Take this to the stranger, and<br />
tell him to go the round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar<br />
must not be shamefaced.&#8221;<br />
So Eumaeus went up to him and said, &#8220;Stranger, Telemachus sends<br />
you this, and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging, for<br />
beggars must not be shamefaced.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses answered, &#8220;May King Jove grant all happiness to<br />
Telemachus, and fulfil the desire of his heart.&#8221;<br />
Then with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and<br />
laid it on the dirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it<br />
while the bard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as he<br />
left off. The suitors applauded the bard, whereon Minerva went up to<br />
Ulysses and prompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of the<br />
suitors, that he might see what kind of people they were, and tell the<br />
good from the bad; but come what might she was not going to save a<br />
single one of them. Ulysses, therefore, went on his round, going<br />
from left to right, and stretched out his hands to beg as though he<br />
were a real beggar. Some of them pitied him, and were curious about<br />
him, asking one another who he was and where he came from; whereon the<br />
goatherd Melanthius said, &#8220;Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell<br />
you something about him, for I have seen him before. The swineherd<br />
brought him here, but I know nothing about the man himself, nor<br />
where he comes from.&#8221;<br />
On this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. &#8220;You precious idiot,&#8221;<br />
he cried, &#8220;what have you brought this man to town for? Have we not<br />
tramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat? Do<br />
you think it a small thing that such people gather here to waste<br />
your master&#8217;s property and must you needs bring this man as well?&#8221;<br />
And Eumaeus answered, &#8220;Antinous, your birth is good but your words<br />
evil. It was no doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to<br />
invite a stranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of those<br />
who can do public service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter,<br />
or a bard who can charm us with his Such men are welcome all the world<br />
over, but no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry him.<br />
You are always harder on Ulysses&#8217; servants than any of the other<br />
suitors are, and above all on me, but I do not care so long as<br />
Telemachus and Penelope are alive and here.&#8221;<br />
But Telemachus said, &#8220;Hush, do not answer him; Antinous has the<br />
bitterest tongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse.&#8221;<br />
Then turning to Antinous he said, &#8220;Antinous, you take as much care<br />
of my interests as though I were your son. Why should you want to<br />
see this stranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take&#8217;<br />
something and give it him yourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take<br />
it. Never mind my mother, nor any of the other servants in the<br />
house; but I know you will not do what I say, for you are more fond of<br />
eating things yourself than of giving them to other people.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What do you mean, Telemachus,&#8221; replied Antinous, &#8220;by this<br />
swaggering talk? If all the suitors were to give him as much as I<br />
will, he would not come here again for another three months.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet<br />
from under the table, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses,<br />
but the other suitors all gave him something, and filled his wallet<br />
with bread and meat; he was about, therefore, to go back to the<br />
threshold and eat what the suitors had given him, but he first went up<br />
to Antinous and said:<br />
&#8220;Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man<br />
here; you seem to be a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you<br />
should be the better giver, and I will tell far and wide of your<br />
bounty. I too was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own;<br />
in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who<br />
he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and<br />
all the other things which people have who live well and are accounted<br />
wealthy, but it pleased Jove to take all away from me. He sent me with<br />
a band of roving robbers to Egypt; it was a long voyage and I was<br />
undone by it. I stationed my bade ships in the river Aegyptus, and<br />
bade my men stay by them and keep guard over them, while sent out<br />
scouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.<br />
&#8220;But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and<br />
ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their<br />
wives and children captives. The alarm was soon carried to the city,<br />
and when they heard the war-cry, the people came out at daybreak<br />
till the plain was filled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the<br />
gleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would<br />
no longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The<br />
Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced<br />
labour for them; as for myself, they gave me to a friend who met them,<br />
to take to Cyprus, Dmetor by name, son of Iasus, who was a great man<br />
in Cyprus. Thence I am come hither in a state of great misery.&#8221;<br />
Then Antinous said, &#8220;What god can have sent such a pestilence to<br />
plague us during our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court,<br />
or I will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence<br />
and importunity; you have begged of all the others, and they have<br />
given you lavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy<br />
to be free with other people&#8217;s property when there is plenty of it.&#8221;<br />
On this Ulysses began to move off, and said, &#8220;Your looks, my fine<br />
sir, are better than your breeding; if you were in your own house<br />
you would not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt, for<br />
though you are in another man&#8217;s, and surrounded with abundance, you<br />
cannot find it in you to give him even a piece of bread.&#8221;<br />
This made Antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, &#8220;You<br />
shall pay for this before you get clear of the court.&#8221; With these<br />
words he threw a footstool at him, and hit him on the right<br />
shoulder-blade near the top of his back. Ulysses stood firm as a<br />
rock and the blow did not even stagger him, but he shook his head in<br />
silence as he brooded on his revenge. Then he went back to the<br />
threshold and sat down there, laying his well-filled wallet at his<br />
feet.<br />
&#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may<br />
speak even as I am minded. A man knows neither ache nor pain if he<br />
gets hit while fighting for his money, or for his sheep or his cattle;<br />
and even so Antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserable<br />
belly, which is always getting people into trouble. Still, if the poor<br />
have gods and avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinous may<br />
come to a bad end before his marriage.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Sit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be off<br />
elsewhere,&#8221; shouted Antinous. &#8220;If you say more I will have you dragged<br />
hand and foot through the courts, and the servants shall flay you<br />
alive.&#8221;<br />
The other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the young<br />
men said, &#8220;Antinous, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a<br />
tramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out to be some<br />
god- and we know the gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as<br />
people from foreign countries, and travel about the world to see who<br />
do amiss and who righteously.&#8221;<br />
Thus said the suitors, but Antinous paid them no heed. Meanwhile<br />
Telemachus was furious about the blow that had been given to his<br />
father, and though no tear fell from him, he shook his head in silence<br />
and brooded on his revenge.<br />
Now when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the<br />
banqueting-cloister, she said before her maids, &#8220;Would that Apollo<br />
would so strike you, Antinous,&#8221; and her waiting woman Eurynome<br />
answered, &#8220;If our prayers were answered not one of the suitors would<br />
ever again see the sun rise.&#8221; Then Penelope said, &#8220;Nurse, I hate every<br />
single one of them, for they mean nothing but mischief, but I hate<br />
Antinous like the darkness of death itself. A poor unfortunate tramp<br />
has come begging about the house for sheer want. Every one else has<br />
given him something to put in his wallet, but Antinous has hit him<br />
on the right shoulder-blade with a footstool.&#8221;<br />
Thus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and<br />
in the meantime Ulysses was getting his dinner. Then she called for<br />
the swineherd and said, &#8220;Eumaeus, go and tell the stranger to come<br />
here, I want to see him and ask him some questions. He seems to have<br />
travelled much, and he may have seen or heard something of my<br />
unhappy husband.&#8221;<br />
To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, &#8220;If these Achaeans,<br />
Madam, would only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history of<br />
his adventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in my<br />
hut, which was the first place he reached after running away from<br />
his ship, and he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes.<br />
If he had been the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world,<br />
on whose lips all hearers hang entranced, I could not have been more<br />
charmed as I sat in my hut and listened to him. He says there is an<br />
old friendship between his house and that of Ulysses, and that he<br />
comes from Crete where the descendants of Minos live, after having<br />
been driven hither and thither by every kind of misfortune; he also<br />
declares that he has heard of Ulysses as being alive and near at<br />
hand among the Thesprotians, and that he is bringing great wealth home<br />
with him.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Call him here, then,&#8221; said Penelope, &#8220;that I too may hear his<br />
story. As for the suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or out<br />
as they will, for they have nothing to fret about. Their corn and wine<br />
remain unwasted in their houses with none but servants to consume<br />
them, while they keep hanging about our house day after day<br />
sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and<br />
never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they<br />
drink. No estate can stand such recklessness, for we have now no<br />
Ulysses to protect us. If he were to come again, he and his son<br />
would soon have their revenge.&#8221;<br />
As she spoke Telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house<br />
resounded with it. Penelope laughed when she heard this, and said to<br />
Eumaeus, &#8220;Go and call the stranger; did you not hear how my son<br />
sneezed just as I was speaking? This can only mean that all the<br />
suitors are going to be killed, and that not one of them shall escape.<br />
Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart: if I am<br />
satisfied that the stranger is speaking the truth I shall give him a<br />
shirt and cloak of good wear.&#8221;<br />
When Eumaeus heard this he went straight to Ulysses and said,<br />
&#8220;Father stranger, my mistress Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has sent<br />
for you; she is in great grief, but she wishes to hear anything you<br />
can tell her about her husband, and if she is satisfied that you are<br />
speaking the truth, she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the<br />
very things that you are most in want of. As for bread, you can get<br />
enough of that to fill your belly, by begging about the town, and<br />
letting those give that will.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I will tell Penelope,&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;nothing but what is<br />
strictly true. I know all about her husband, and have been partner<br />
with him in affliction, but I am afraid of passing. through this crowd<br />
of cruel suitors, for their pride and insolence reach heaven. Just<br />
now, moreover, as I was going about the house without doing any<br />
harm, a man gave me a blow that hurt me very much, but neither<br />
Telemachus nor any one else defended me. Tell Penelope, therefore,<br />
to be patient and wait till sundown. Let her give me a seat close up<br />
to the fire, for my clothes are worn very thin- you know they are, for<br />
you have seen them ever since I first asked you to help me- she can<br />
then ask me about the return of her husband.&#8221;<br />
The swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as she<br />
saw him cross the threshold, &#8220;Why do you not bring him here,<br />
Eumaeus? Is he afraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shy<br />
of coming inside the house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced.&#8221;<br />
To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, &#8220;The stranger is quite<br />
reasonable. He is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any one<br />
else would do. He asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be much<br />
better, madam, that you should have him all to yourself, when you<br />
can hear him and talk to him as you will.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The man is no fool,&#8221; answered Penelope, &#8220;it would very likely be as<br />
he says, for there are no such abominable people in the whole world as<br />
these men are.&#8221;<br />
When she had done speaking Eumaeus went back to the suitors, for<br />
he had explained everything. Then he went up to Telemachus and said in<br />
his ear so that none could overhear him, &#8220;My dear sir, I will now go<br />
back to the pigs, to see after your property and my own business.<br />
You will look to what is going on here, but above all be careful to<br />
keep out of danger, for there are many who bear you ill will. May Jove<br />
bring them to a bad end before they do us a mischief.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Very well,&#8221; replied Telemachus, &#8220;go home when you have had your<br />
dinner, and in the morning come here with the victims we are to<br />
sacrifice for the day. Leave the rest to heaven and me.&#8221;<br />
On this Eumaeus took his seat again, and when he had finished his<br />
dinner he left the courts and the cloister with the men at table,<br />
and went back to his pigs. As for the suitors, they presently began to<br />
amuse themselves with singing and dancing, for it was now getting on<br />
towards evening.</p>
<p>
BOOK XVIII</p>
<p>NOW there came a certain common tramp who used to go begging all<br />
over the city of Ithaca, and was notorious as an incorrigible<br />
glutton and drunkard. This man had no strength nor stay in him, but he<br />
was a great hulking fellow to look at; his real name, the one his<br />
mother gave him, was Arnaeus, but the young men of the place called<br />
him Irus, because he used to run errands for any one who would send<br />
him. As soon as he came he began to insult Ulysses, and to try and<br />
drive him out of his own house.<br />
&#8220;Be off, old man,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;from the doorway, or you shall be<br />
dragged out neck and heels. Do you not see that they are all giving me<br />
the wink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not<br />
like to do so? Get up then, and go of yourself, or we shall come to<br />
blows.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses frowned on him and said, &#8220;My friend, I do you no manner of<br />
harm; people give you a great deal, but I am not jealous. There is<br />
room enough in this doorway for the pair of us, and you need not<br />
grudge me things that are not yours to give. You seem to be just<br />
such another tramp as myself, but perhaps the gods will give us better<br />
luck by and by. Do not, however, talk too much about fighting or you<br />
will incense me, and old though I am, I shall cover your mouth and<br />
chest with blood. I shall have more peace to-morrow if I do, for you<br />
will not come to the house of Ulysses any more.&#8221;<br />
Irus was very angry and answered, &#8220;You filthy glutton, you run on<br />
trippingly like an old fish-fag. I have a good mind to lay both<br />
hands about you, and knock your teeth out of your head like so many<br />
boar&#8217;s tusks. Get ready, therefore, and let these people here stand by<br />
and look on. You will never be able to fight one who is so much<br />
younger than yourself.&#8221;<br />
Thus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in<br />
front of the doorway, and when Antinous saw what was going on he<br />
laughed heartily and said to the others, &#8220;This is the finest sport<br />
that you ever saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it into this<br />
house. The stranger and Irus have quarreled and are going to fight,<br />
let us set them on to do so at once.&#8221;<br />
The suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the two<br />
ragged tramps. &#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; said Antinous, &#8220;there are some goats&#8217;<br />
paunches down at the fire, which we have filled with blood and fat,<br />
and set aside for supper; he who is victorious and proves himself to<br />
be the better man shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be free<br />
of our table and we will not allow any other beggar about the house at<br />
all.&#8221;<br />
The others all agreed, but Ulysses, to throw them off the scent,<br />
said, &#8220;Sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannot<br />
hold his own against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges<br />
me on, though I know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. You<br />
must swear, however that none of you will give me a foul blow to<br />
favour Irus and secure him the victory.&#8221;<br />
They swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oath<br />
Telemachus put in a word and said, &#8220;Stranger, if you have a mind to<br />
settle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here.<br />
Whoever strikes you will have to fight more than one. I am host, and<br />
the other chiefs, Antinous and Eurymachus, both of them men of<br />
understanding, are of the same mind as I am.&#8221;<br />
Every one assented, and Ulysses girded his old rags about his loins,<br />
thus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, and<br />
his mighty arms; but Minerva came up to him and made his limbs even<br />
stronger still. The suitors were beyond measure astonished, and one<br />
would turn towards his neighbour saying, &#8220;The stranger has brought<br />
such a thigh out of his old rags that there will soon be nothing<br />
left of Irus.&#8221;<br />
Irus began to be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servants<br />
girded him by force, and brought him [into the open part of the court]<br />
in such a fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. Antinous<br />
scolded him and said, &#8220;You swaggering bully, you ought never to have<br />
been born at all if you are afraid of such an old broken-down creature<br />
as this tramp is. I say, therefore- and it shall surely be- if he<br />
beats you and proves himself the better man, I shall pack you off on<br />
board ship to the mainland and send you to king Echetus, who kills<br />
every one that comes near him. He will cut off your nose and ears, and<br />
draw out your entrails for the dogs to eat.&#8221;<br />
This frightened Irus still more, but they brought him into the<br />
middle of the court, and the two men raised their hands to fight. Then<br />
Ulysses considered whether he should let drive so hard at him as to<br />
make an end of him then and there, or whether he should give him a<br />
lighter blow that should only knock him down; in the end he deemed<br />
it best to give the lighter blow for fear the Achaeans should begin to<br />
suspect who he was. Then they began to fight, and Irus hit Ulysses<br />
on the right shoulder; but Ulysses gave Irus a blow on the neck<br />
under the ear that broke in the bones of his skull, and the blood came<br />
gushing out of his mouth; he fell groaning in the dust, gnashing his<br />
teeth and kicking on the ground, but the suitors threw up their<br />
hands and nearly died of laughter, as Ulysses caught hold of him by<br />
the foot and dragged him into the outer court as far as the<br />
gate-house. There he propped him up against the wall and put his staff<br />
in his hands. &#8220;Sit here,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and keep the dogs and pigs off;<br />
you are a pitiful creature, and if you try to make yourself king of<br />
the beggars any more you shall fare still worse.&#8221;<br />
Then he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn, over<br />
his shoulder with the cord by which it hung, and went back to sit down<br />
upon the threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters,<br />
laughing and saluting him, &#8220;May Jove, and all the other gods,&#8221; said<br />
they, &#8216;grant you whatever you want for having put an end to the<br />
importunity of this insatiable tramp. We will take him over to the<br />
mainland presently, to king Echetus, who kills every one that comes<br />
near him.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses hailed this as of good omen, and Antinous set a great goat&#8217;s<br />
paunch before him filled with blood and fat. Amphinomus took two<br />
loaves out of the bread-basket and brought them to him, pledging him<br />
as he did so in a golden goblet of wine. &#8220;Good luck to you,&#8221; he<br />
said, &#8220;father stranger, you are very badly off at present, but I<br />
hope you will have better times by and by.&#8221;<br />
To this Ulysses answered, &#8220;Amphinomus, you seem to be a man of<br />
good understanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing whose son you<br />
are. I have heard your father well spoken of; he is Nisus of<br />
Dulichium, a man both brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son,<br />
and you appear to be a considerable person; listen, therefore, and<br />
take heed to what I am saying. Man is the vainest of all creatures<br />
that have their being upon earth. As long as heaven vouchsafes him<br />
health and strength, he thinks that he shall come to no harm<br />
hereafter, and even when the blessed gods bring sorrow upon him, he<br />
bears it as he needs must, and makes the best of it; for God<br />
Almighty gives men their daily minds day by day. I know all about<br />
it, for I was a rich man once, and did much wrong in the<br />
stubbornness of my pride, and in the confidence that my father and<br />
my brothers would support me; therefore let a man fear God in all<br />
things always, and take the good that heaven may see fit to send him<br />
without vainglory. Consider the infamy of what these suitors are<br />
doing; see how they are wasting the estate, and doing dishonour to the<br />
wife, of one who is certain to return some day, and that, too, not<br />
long hence. Nay, he will be here soon; may heaven send you home<br />
quietly first that you may not meet with him in the day of his coming,<br />
for once he is here the suitors and he will not part bloodlessly.&#8221;<br />
With these words he made a drink-offering, and when he had drunk<br />
he put the gold cup again into the hands of Amphinomus, who walked<br />
away serious and bowing his head, for he foreboded evil. But even so<br />
he did not escape destruction, for Minerva had doomed him fall by<br />
the hand of Telemachus. So he took his seat again at the place from<br />
which he had come.<br />
Then Minerva put it into the mind of Penelope to show herself to the<br />
suitors, that she might make them still more enamoured of her, and win<br />
still further honour from her son and husband. So she feigned a<br />
mocking laugh and said, &#8220;Eurynome, I have changed my and have a<br />
fancy to show myself to the suitors although I detest them. I should<br />
like also to give my son a hint that he had better not have anything<br />
more to do with them. They speak fairly enough but they mean<br />
mischief.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My dear child,&#8221; answered Eurynome, &#8220;all that you have said is true,<br />
go and tell your son about it, but first wash yourself and anoint your<br />
face. Do not go about with your cheeks all covered with tears; it is<br />
not right that you should grieve so incessantly; for Telemachus,<br />
whom you always prayed that you might live to see with a beard, is<br />
already grown up.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I know, Eurynome,&#8221; replied Penelope, &#8220;that you mean well, but do<br />
not try and persuade me to wash and to anoint myself, for heaven<br />
robbed me of all my beauty on the day my husband sailed; nevertheless,<br />
tell Autonoe and Hippodamia that I want them. They must be with me<br />
when I am in the cloister; I am not going among the men alone; it<br />
would not be proper for me to do so.&#8221;<br />
On this the old woman went out of the room to bid the maids go to<br />
their mistress. In the meantime Minerva bethought her of another<br />
matter, and sent Penelope off into a sweet slumber; so she lay down on<br />
her couch and her limbs became heavy with sleep. Then the goddess shed<br />
grace and beauty over her that all the Achaeans might admire her.<br />
She washed her face with the ambrosial loveliness that Venus wears<br />
when she goes dancing with the Graces; she made her taller and of a<br />
more commanding figure, while as for her complexion it was whiter than<br />
sawn ivory. When Minerva had done all this she went away, whereon<br />
the maids came in from the women&#8217;s room and woke Penelope with the<br />
sound of their talking.<br />
&#8220;What an exquisitely delicious sleep I have been having,&#8221; said<br />
she, as she passed her hands over her face, &#8220;in spite of all my<br />
misery. I wish Diana would let me die so sweetly now at this very<br />
moment, that I might no longer waste in despair for the loss of my<br />
dear husband, who possessed every kind of good quality and was the<br />
most distinguished man among the Achaeans.&#8221;<br />
With these words she came down from her upper room, not alone but<br />
attended by two of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she<br />
stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,<br />
holding a veil before her face, and with a staid maid servant on<br />
either side of her. As they beheld her the suitors were so overpowered<br />
and became so desperately enamoured of her, that each one prayed he<br />
might win her for his own bed fellow.<br />
&#8220;Telemachus,&#8221; said she, addressing her son, &#8220;I fear you are no<br />
longer so discreet and well conducted as you used to be. When you were<br />
younger you had a greater sense of propriety; now, however, that you<br />
are grown up, though a stranger to look at you would take you for<br />
the son of a well-to-do father as far as size and good looks go,<br />
your conduct is by no means what it should be. What is all this<br />
disturbance that has been going on, and how came you to allow a<br />
stranger to be so disgracefully ill-treated? What would have<br />
happened if he had suffered serious injury while a suppliant in our<br />
house? Surely this would have been very discreditable to you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I am not surprised, my dear mother, at your displeasure,&#8221; replied<br />
Telemachus, &#8220;I understand all about it and know when things are not as<br />
they should be, which I could not do when I was younger; I cannot,<br />
however, behave with perfect propriety at all times. First one and<br />
then another of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of my<br />
mind, and I have no one to stand by me. After all, however, this fight<br />
between Irus and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant it<br />
to do, for the stranger got the best of it. I wish Father Jove,<br />
Minerva, and Apollo would break the neck of every one of these<br />
wooers of yours, some inside the house and some out; and I wish they<br />
might all be as limp as Irus is over yonder in the gate of the outer<br />
court. See how he nods his head like a drunken man; he has had such<br />
a thrashing that he cannot stand on his feet nor get back to his home,<br />
wherever that may be, for has no strength left in him.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse. Eurymachus then came up and said, &#8220;Queen<br />
Penelope, daughter of Icarius, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos<br />
could see you at this moment, you would have still more suitors in<br />
your house by tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman<br />
in the whole world both as regards personal beauty and strength of<br />
understanding.&#8221;<br />
To this Penelope replied, &#8220;Eurymachus, heaven robbed me of all my<br />
beauty whether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy<br />
and my dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after<br />
my affairs, I should both be more respected and show a better presence<br />
to the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the<br />
afflictions which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. My husband<br />
foresaw it all, and when he was leaving home he took my right wrist in<br />
his hand- &#8216;Wife, &#8216;he said, &#8216;we shall not all of us come safe home<br />
from Troy, for the Trojans fight well both with bow and spear. They<br />
are excellent also at fighting from chariots, and nothing decides<br />
the issue of a fight sooner than this. I know not, therefore,<br />
whether heaven will send me back to you, or whether I may not fall<br />
over there at Troy. In the meantime do you look after things here.<br />
Take care of my father and mother as at present, and even more so<br />
during my absence, but when you see our son growing a beard, then<br />
marry whom you will, and leave this your present home. This is what he<br />
said and now it is all coming true. A night will come when I shall<br />
have to yield myself to a marriage which I detest, for Jove has<br />
taken from me all hope of happiness. This further grief, moreover,<br />
cuts me to the very heart. You suitors are not wooing me after the<br />
custom of my country. When men are courting a woman who they think<br />
will be a good wife to them and who is of noble birth, and when they<br />
are each trying to win her for himself, they usually bring oxen and<br />
sheep to feast the friends of the lady, and they make her<br />
magnificent presents, instead of eating up other people&#8217;s property<br />
without paying for it.&#8221;<br />
This was what she said, and Ulysses was glad when he heard her<br />
trying to get presents out of the suitors, and flattering them with<br />
fair words which he knew she did not mean.<br />
Then Antinous said, &#8220;Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take as<br />
many presents as you please from any one who will give them to you; it<br />
is not well to refuse a present; but we will not go about our business<br />
nor stir from where we are, till you have married the best man among<br />
us whoever he may be.&#8221;<br />
The others applauded what Antinous had said, and each one sent his<br />
servant to bring his present. Antinous&#8217;s man returned with a large and<br />
lovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully<br />
made brooch pins of pure gold with which to fasten it. Eurymachus<br />
immediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads<br />
that gleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas&#8217;s two men returned with some<br />
earrings fashioned into three brilliant pendants which glistened<br />
most beautifully; while king Pisander son of Polyctor gave her a<br />
necklace of the rarest workmanship, and every one else brought her a<br />
beautiful present of some kind.<br />
Then the queen went back to her room upstairs, and her maids brought<br />
the presents after her. Meanwhile the suitors took to singing and<br />
dancing, and stayed till evening came. They danced and sang till it<br />
grew dark; they then brought in three braziers to give light, and<br />
piled them up with chopped firewood very and dry, and they lit torches<br />
from them, which the maids held up turn and turn about. Then Ulysses<br />
said:<br />
&#8220;Maids, servants of Ulysses who has so long been absent, go to the<br />
queen inside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and<br />
pick wool. I will hold the light for all these people. They may stay<br />
till morning, but shall not beat me, for I can stand a great deal.&#8221;<br />
The maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty Melantho<br />
began to gibe at him contemptuously. She was daughter to Dolius, but<br />
had been brought up by Penelope, who used to give her toys to play<br />
with, and looked after her when she was a child; but in spite of all<br />
this she showed no consideration for the sorrows of her mistress,<br />
and used to misconduct herself with Eurymachus, with whom she was in<br />
love.<br />
&#8220;Poor wretch,&#8221; said she, &#8220;are you gone clean out of your mind? Go<br />
and sleep in some smithy, or place of public gossips, instead of<br />
chattering here. Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your<br />
betters- so many of them too? Has the wine been getting into your<br />
head, or do you always babble in this way? You seem to have lost<br />
your wits because you beat the tramp Irus; take care that a better man<br />
than he does not come and cudgel you about the head till he pack you<br />
bleeding out of the house.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Vixen,&#8221; replied Ulysses, scowling at her, &#8220;I will go and tell<br />
Telemachus what you have been saying, and he will have you torn limb<br />
from limb.&#8221;<br />
With these words he scared the women, and they went off into the<br />
body of the house. They trembled all aver, for they thought he would<br />
do as he said. But Ulysses took his stand near the burning braziers,<br />
holding up torches and looking at the people- brooding the while on<br />
things that should surely come to pass.<br />
But Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their<br />
insolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become even more bitter against<br />
them; she therefore set Eurymachus son of Polybus on to gibe at him,<br />
which made the others laugh. &#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you suitors<br />
of Queen Penelope, that I may speak even as I am minded. It is not for<br />
nothing that this man has come to the house of Ulysses; I believe<br />
the light has not been coming from the torches, but from his own head-<br />
for his hair is all gone, every bit of it.&#8221;<br />
Then turning to Ulysses he said, &#8220;Stranger, will you work as a<br />
servant, if I send you to the wolds and see that you are well paid?<br />
Can you build a stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all<br />
the year round, and will find you in shoes and clothing. Will you<br />
go, then? Not you; for you have got into bad ways, and do not want<br />
to work; you had rather fill your belly by going round the country<br />
begging.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Eurymachus,&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;if you and I were to work one<br />
against the other in early summer when the days are at their<br />
longest- give me a good scythe, and take another yourself, and let<br />
us see which will fast the longer or mow the stronger, from dawn<br />
till dark when the mowing grass is about. Or if you will plough<br />
against me, let us each take a yoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and of<br />
great strength and endurance: turn me into a four acre field, and<br />
see whether you or I can drive the straighter furrow. If, again, war<br />
were to break out this day, give me a shield, a couple of spears and a<br />
helmet fitting well upon my temples- you would find me foremost in the<br />
fray, and would cease your gibes about my belly. You are insolent<br />
and cruel, and think yourself a great man because you live in a little<br />
world, ind that a bad one. If Ulysses comes to his own again, the<br />
doors of his house are wide, but you will find them narrow when you<br />
try to fly through them.&#8221;<br />
Eurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried,<br />
&#8220;You wretch, I will soon pay you out for daring to say such things<br />
to me, and in public too. Has the wine been getting into your head<br />
or do you always babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits<br />
because you beat the tramp Irus. With this he caught hold of a<br />
footstool, but Ulysses sought protection at the knees of Amphinomus of<br />
Dulichium, for he was afraid. The stool hit the cupbearer on his right<br />
hand and knocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back,<br />
and his wine-jug fell ringing to the ground. The suitors in the<br />
covered cloister were now in an uproar, and one would turn towards his<br />
neighbour, saying, &#8220;I wish the stranger had gone somewhere else, bad<br />
luck to hide, for all the trouble he gives us. We cannot permit such<br />
disturbance about a beggar; if such ill counsels are to prevail we<br />
shall have no more pleasure at our banquet.&#8221;<br />
On this Telemachus came forward and said, &#8220;Sirs, are you mad? Can<br />
you not carry your meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit has<br />
possessed you. I do not wish to drive any of you away, but you have<br />
had your suppers, and the sooner you all go home to bed the better.&#8221;<br />
The suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his<br />
speech; but Amphinomus the son of Nisus, who was son to Aretias, said,<br />
&#8220;Do not let us take offence; it is reasonable, so let us make no<br />
answer. Neither let us do violence to the stranger nor to any of<br />
Ulysses&#8217; servants. Let the cupbearer go round with the<br />
drink-offerings, that we may make them and go home to our rest. As for<br />
the stranger, let us leave Telemachus to deal with him, for it is to<br />
his house that he has come.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so Mulius of<br />
Dulichium, servant to Amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine and<br />
water and handed it round to each of them man by man, whereon they<br />
made their drink-offerings to the blessed gods: Then, when they had<br />
made their drink-offerings and had drunk each one as he was minded,<br />
they took their several ways each of them to his own abode.</p>
<p>
BOOK XIX</p>
<p>ULYSSES was left in the cloister, pondering on the means whereby<br />
with Minerva&#8217;s help he might be able to kill the suitors. Presently he<br />
said to Telemachus, &#8220;Telemachus, we must get the armour together and<br />
take it down inside. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you<br />
have removed it. Say that you have taken it to be out of the way of<br />
the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went<br />
away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more<br />
particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel<br />
over their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which may<br />
disgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes<br />
tempts people to use them.&#8221;<br />
Telemachus approved of what his father had said, so he called<br />
nurse Euryclea and said, &#8220;Nurse, shut the women up in their room,<br />
while I take the armour that my father left behind him down into the<br />
store room. No one looks after it now my father is gone, and it has<br />
got all smirched with soot during my own boyhood. I want to take it<br />
down where the smoke cannot reach it.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I wish, child,&#8221; answered Euryclea, &#8220;that you would take the<br />
management of the house into your own hands altogether, and look after<br />
all the property yourself. But who is to go with you and light you<br />
to the store room? The maids would have so, but you would not let<br />
them.<br />
&#8220;The stranger,&#8221; said Telemachus, &#8220;shall show me a light; when people<br />
eat my bread they must earn it, no matter where they come from.&#8221;<br />
Euryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside their<br />
room. Then Ulysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets,<br />
shields, and spears inside; and Minerva went before them with a gold<br />
lamp in her hand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereon<br />
Telemachus said, &#8220;Father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls,<br />
with the rafters, crossbeams, and the supports on which they rest<br />
are all aglow as with a flaming fire. Surely there is some god here<br />
who has come down from heaven.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Hush,&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;hold your peace and ask no questions, for<br />
this is the manner of the gods. Get you to your bed, and leave me here<br />
to talk with your mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief<br />
will ask me all sorts of questions.&#8221;<br />
On this Telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of the<br />
inner court, to the room in which he always slept. There he lay in his<br />
bed till morning, while Ulysses was left in the cloister pondering<br />
on the means whereby with Minerva&#8217;s help he might be able to kill<br />
the suitors.<br />
Then Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana,<br />
and they set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near<br />
the fire in her accustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and had<br />
a footstool all in one piece with the seat itself; and it was<br />
covered with a thick fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids came<br />
from the women&#8217;s room to join her. They set about removing the<br />
tables at which the wicked suitors had been dining, and took away<br />
the bread that was left, with the cups from which they had drunk. They<br />
emptied the embers out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon them<br />
to give both light and heat; but Melantho began to rail at Ulysses a<br />
second time and said, &#8220;Stranger, do you mean to plague us by hanging<br />
about the house all night and spying upon the women? Be off, you<br />
wretch, outside, and eat your supper there, or you shall be driven out<br />
with a firebrand.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses scowled at her and answered, &#8220;My good woman, why should<br />
you be so angry with me? Is it because I am not clean, and my<br />
clothes are all in rags, and because I am obliged to go begging<br />
about after the manner of tramps and beggars generall? I too was a<br />
rich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those days I gave to<br />
many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might be nor what he<br />
wanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other things which<br />
people have who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased<br />
Jove to take all away from me; therefore, woman, beware lest you too<br />
come to lose that pride and place in which you now wanton above your<br />
fellows; have a care lest you get out of favour with your mistress,<br />
and lest Ulysses should come home, for there is still a chance that he<br />
may do so. Moreover, though he be dead as you think he is, yet by<br />
Apollo&#8217;s will he has left a son behind him, Telemachus, who will<br />
note anything done amiss by the maids in the house, for he is now no<br />
longer in his boyhood.&#8221;<br />
Penelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, &#8220;Impudent<br />
baggage, said she, &#8220;I see how abominably you are behaving, and you<br />
shall smart for it. You knew perfectly well, for I told you myself,<br />
that I was going to see the stranger and ask him about my husband, for<br />
whose sake I am in such continual sorrow.&#8221;<br />
Then she said to her head waiting woman Eurynome, &#8220;Bring a seat with<br />
a fleece upon it, for the stranger to sit upon while he tells his<br />
story, and listens to what I have to say. I wish to ask him some<br />
questions.&#8221;<br />
Eurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and as<br />
soon as Ulysses had sat down Penelope began by saying, &#8220;Stranger, I<br />
shall first ask you who and whence are you? Tell me of your town and<br />
parents.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Madam;&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;who on the face of the whole earth can<br />
dare to chide with you? Your fame reaches the firmament of heaven<br />
itself; you are like some blameless king, who upholds righteousness,<br />
as the monarch over a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its<br />
wheat and barley, the trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring<br />
forth lambs, and the sea abounds with fish by reason of his virtues,<br />
and his people do good deeds under him. Nevertheless, as I sit here in<br />
your house, ask me some other question and do not seek to know my race<br />
and family, or you will recall memories that will yet more increase my<br />
sorrow. I am full of heaviness, but I ought not to sit weeping and<br />
wailing in another person&#8217;s house, nor is it well to be thus<br />
grieving continually. I shall have one of the servants or even<br />
yourself complaining of me, and saying that my eyes swim with tears<br />
because I am heavy with wine.&#8221;<br />
Then Penelope answered, &#8220;Stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty,<br />
whether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and my<br />
dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs<br />
I should be both more respected and should show a better presence to<br />
the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the<br />
afflictions which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs from<br />
all our islands- Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus, as also from Ithaca<br />
itself, are wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can<br />
therefore show no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to<br />
people who say that they are skilled artisans, but am all the time<br />
brokenhearted about Ulysses. They want me to marry again at once,<br />
and I have to invent stratagems in order to deceive them. In the first<br />
place heaven put it in my mind to set up a great tambour-frame in my<br />
room, and to begin working upon an enormous piece of fine<br />
needlework. Then I said to them, &#8216;Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead,<br />
still, do not press me to marry again immediately; wait- for I would<br />
not have my skill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I have<br />
finished making a pall for the hero Laertes, to be ready against the<br />
time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of<br />
the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.&#8217; This was what I<br />
said, and they assented; whereon I used to keep working at my great<br />
web all day long, but at night I would unpick the stitches again by<br />
torch light. I fooled them in this way for three years without their<br />
finding it out, but as time wore on and I was now in my fourth year,<br />
in the waning of moons, and many days had been accomplished, those<br />
good-for-nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to the suitors, who<br />
broke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry with me, so I was<br />
forced to finish my work whether I would or no. And now I do not see<br />
how I can find any further shift for getting out of this marriage.<br />
My parents are putting great pressure upon me, and my son chafes at<br />
the ravages the suitors are making upon his estate, for he is now<br />
old enough to understand all about it and is perfectly able to look<br />
after his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with an excellent<br />
disposition. Still, notwithstanding all this, tell me who you are<br />
and where you come from- for you must have had father and mother of<br />
some sort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock.&#8221;<br />
Then Ulysses answered, &#8220;madam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist in<br />
asking me about my family, I will answer, no matter what it costs<br />
me: people must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as long<br />
as I have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless,<br />
as regards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a<br />
fair and fruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thickly<br />
peopled and there are nine cities in it: the people speak many<br />
different languages which overlap one another, for there are Achaeans,<br />
brave Eteocretans, Dorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi.<br />
There is a great town there, Cnossus, where Minos reigned who every<br />
nine years had a conference with Jove himself. Minos was father to<br />
Deucalion, whose son I am, for Deucalion had two sons Idomeneus and<br />
myself. Idomeneus sailed for Troy, and I, who am the younger, am<br />
called Aethon; my brother, however, was at once the older and the more<br />
valiant of the two; hence it was in Crete that I saw Ulysses and<br />
showed him hospitality, for the winds took him there as he was on<br />
his way to Troy, carrying him out of his course from cape Malea and<br />
leaving him in Amnisus off the cave of Ilithuia, where the harbours<br />
are difficult to enter and he could hardly find shelter from the winds<br />
that were then xaging. As soon as he got there he went into the town<br />
and asked for Idomeneus, claiming to be his old and valued friend, but<br />
Idomeneus had already set sail for Troy some ten or twelve days<br />
earlier, so I took him to my own house and showed him every kind of<br />
hospitality, for I had abundance of everything. Moreover, I fed the<br />
men who were with him with barley meal from the public store, and<br />
got subscriptions of wine and oxen for them to sacrifice to their<br />
heart&#8217;s content. They stayed with me twelve days, for there was a gale<br />
blowing from the North so strong that one could hardly keep one&#8217;s feet<br />
on land. I suppose some unfriendly god had raised it for them, but<br />
on the thirteenth day the wind dropped, and they got away.&#8221;<br />
Many a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelope<br />
wept as she listened, for her heart was melted. As the snow wastes<br />
upon the mountain tops when the winds from South East and West have<br />
breathed upon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with<br />
water, even so did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husband<br />
who was all the time sitting by her side. Ulysses felt for her and was<br />
for her, but he kept his eyes as hard as or iron without letting<br />
them so much as quiver, so cunningly did he restrain his tears.<br />
Then, when she had relieved herself by weeping, she turned to him<br />
again and said: &#8220;Now, stranger, I shall put you to the test and see<br />
whether or no you really did entertain my husband and his men, as<br />
you say you did. Tell me, then, how he was dressed, what kind of a man<br />
he was to look at, and so also with his companions.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Madam,&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;it is such a long time ago that I can<br />
hardly say. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home,<br />
and went elsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I can<br />
recollect. Ulysses wore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and<br />
it was fastened by a gold brooch with two catches for the pin. On<br />
the face of this there was a device that showed a dog holding a<br />
spotted fawn between his fore paws, and watching it as it lay<br />
panting upon the ground. Every one marvelled at the way in which these<br />
things had been done in gold, the dog looking at the fawn, and<br />
strangling it, while the fawn was struggling convulsively to escape.<br />
As for the shirt that he wore next his skin, it was so soft that it<br />
fitted him like the skin of an onion, and glistened in the sunlight to<br />
the admiration of all the women who beheld it. Furthermore I say,<br />
and lay my saying to your heart, that I do not know whether Ulysses<br />
wore these clothes when he left home, or whether one of his companions<br />
had given them to him while he was on his voyage; or possibly some one<br />
at whose house he was staying made him a present of them, for he was a<br />
man of many friends and had few equals among the Achaeans. I myself<br />
gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful purple mantle, double<br />
lined, with a shirt that went down to his feet, and I sent him on<br />
board his ship with every mark of honour. He had a servant with him, a<br />
little older than himself, and I can tell you what he was like; his<br />
shoulders were hunched, he was dark, and he had thick curly hair.<br />
His name was Eurybates, and Ulysses treated him with greater<br />
familiarity than he did any of the others, as being the most<br />
like-minded with himself.&#8221;<br />
Penelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable<br />
proofs that Ulysses laid before her; and when she had again found<br />
relief in tears she said to him, &#8220;Stranger, I was already disposed<br />
to pity you, but henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome<br />
in my house. It was I who gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of. I<br />
took them out of the store room and folded them up myself, and I<br />
gave him also the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall<br />
never welcome him home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set<br />
out for that detested city whose very name I cannot bring myself<br />
even to mention.&#8221;<br />
Then Ulysses answered, &#8220;Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigure<br />
yourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can<br />
hardly blame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and<br />
borne him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even<br />
though he were a worse man than Ulysses, who they say was like a<br />
god. Still, cease your tears and listen to what I can tell I will hide<br />
nothing from you, and can say with perfect truth that I have lately<br />
heard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the<br />
Thesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that he<br />
has begged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew<br />
were lost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and the<br />
sun-god were angry with him because his men had slaughtered the<br />
sun-god&#8217;s cattle, and they were all drowned to a man. But Ulysses<br />
stuck to the keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of the<br />
Phaecians, who are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated him<br />
as though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing<br />
to escort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been<br />
here long ago, had he not thought better to go from land to land<br />
gathering wealth; for there is no man living who is so wily as he<br />
is; there is no one can compare with him. Pheidon king of the<br />
Thesprotians told me all this, and he swore to me- making<br />
drink-offerings in his house as he did so- that the ship was by the<br />
water side and the crew found who would take Ulysses to his own<br />
country. He sent me off first, for there happened to be a<br />
Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium,<br />
but he showed me all treasure Ulysses had got together, and he had<br />
enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep his family for ten<br />
generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he<br />
might learn Jove&#8217;s mind from the high oak tree, and know whether after<br />
so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret.<br />
So you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close at<br />
hand and cannot remain away from home much longer; nevertheless I will<br />
confirm my words with an oath, and call Jove who is the first and<br />
mightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of Ulysses to<br />
which I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely come to<br />
pass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end of this<br />
moon and the beginning of the next he will be here.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;May it be even so,&#8221; answered Penelope; &#8220;if your words come true you<br />
shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see<br />
you shall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be.<br />
Ulysses will not return, neither will you get your escort hence, for<br />
so surely as that Ulysses ever was, there are now no longer any such<br />
masters in the house as he was, to receive honourable strangers or<br />
to further them on their way home. And now, you maids, wash his feet<br />
for him, and make him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he<br />
may be warm and quiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and<br />
anoint him again, that he may sit in the cloister and take his meals<br />
with Telemachus. It shall be the worse for any one of these hateful<br />
people who is uncivil to him; like it or not, he shall have no more to<br />
do in this house. For how, sir, shall you be able to learn whether<br />
or no I am superior to others of my sex both in goodness of heart<br />
and understanding, if I let you dine in my cloisters squalid and ill<br />
clad? Men live but for a little season; if they are hard, and deal<br />
hardly, people wish them ill so long as they are alive, and speak<br />
contemptuously of them when they are dead, but he that is righteous<br />
and deals righteously, the people tell of his praise among all<br />
lands, and many shall call him blessed.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses answered, &#8220;Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from<br />
the day that I left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard. I<br />
will lie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Night<br />
after night have I passed in any rough sleeping place, and waited<br />
for morning. Nor, again, do I like having my feet washed; I shall<br />
not let any of the young hussies about your house touch my feet;<br />
but, if you have any old and respectable woman who has gone through as<br />
much trouble as I have, I will allow her to wash them.&#8221;<br />
To this Penelope said, &#8220;My dear sir, of all the guests who ever<br />
yet came to my house there never was one who spoke in all things<br />
with such admirable propriety as you do. There happens to be in the<br />
house a most respectable old woman- the same who received my poor dear<br />
husband in her arms the night he was born, and nursed him in<br />
infancy. She is very feeble now, but she shall wash your feet.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Come here,&#8221; said she, &#8220;Euryclea, and wash your master&#8217;s age-mate; I<br />
suppose Ulysses&#8217; hands and feet are very much the same now as his are,<br />
for trouble ages all of us dreadfully fast.&#8221;<br />
On these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she<br />
began to weep and made lamentation saying, &#8220;My dear child, I cannot<br />
think whatever I am to do with you. I am certain no one was ever<br />
more god-fearing than yourself, and yet Jove hates you. No one in<br />
the whole world ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer<br />
hecatombs when you prayed you might come to a green old age yourself<br />
and see your son grow up to take after you; yet see how he has<br />
prevented you alone from ever getting back to your own home. I have no<br />
doubt the women in some foreign palace which Ulysses has got to are<br />
gibing at him as all these sluts here have been gibing you. I do not<br />
wonder at your not choosing to let them wash you after the manner in<br />
which they have insulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladly<br />
enough, as Penelope has said that I am to do so; I will wash them both<br />
for Penelope&#8217;s sake and for your own, for you have raised the most<br />
lively feelings of compassion in my mind; and let me say this<br />
moreover, which pray attend to; we have had all kinds of strangers<br />
in distress come here before now, but I make bold to say that no one<br />
ever yet came who was so like Ulysses in figure, voice, and feet as<br />
you are.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Those who have seen us both,&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;have always said<br />
we were wonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it too.<br />
Then the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going to<br />
wash his feet, and poured plenty of cold water into it, adding hot<br />
till the bath was warm enough. Ulysses sat by the fire, but ere long<br />
he turned away from the light, for it occurred to him that when the<br />
old woman had hold of his leg she would recognize a certain scar which<br />
it bore, whereon the whole truth would come out. And indeed as soon as<br />
she began washing her master, she at once knew the scar as one that<br />
had been given him by a wild boar when he was hunting on Mount<br />
Parnassus with his excellent grandfather Autolycus- who was the most<br />
accomplished thief and perjurer in the whole world- and with the<br />
sons of Autolycus. Mercury himself had endowed him with this gift, for<br />
he used to burn the thigh bones of goats and kids to him, so he took<br />
pleasure in his companionship. It happened once that Autolycus had<br />
gone to Ithaca and had found the child of his daughter just born. As<br />
soon as he had done supper Euryclea set the infant upon his knees<br />
and said, you must find a name for your grandson; you greatly wished<br />
that you might have one.&#8221;<br />
&#8216;Son-in-law and daughter,&#8221; replied Autolycus, &#8220;call the child<br />
thus: I am highly displeased with a large number of people in one<br />
place and another, both men and women; so name the child &#8216;Ulysses,&#8217; or<br />
the child of anger. When he grows up and comes to visit his mother&#8217;s<br />
family on Mount Parnassus, where my possessions lie, I will make him a<br />
present and will send him on his way rejoicing.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses, therefore, went to Parnassus to get the presents from<br />
Autolycus, who with his sons shook hands with him and gave him<br />
welcome. His grandmother Amphithea threw her arms about him, and<br />
kissed his head, and both his beautiful eyes, while Autolycus<br />
desired his sons to get dinner ready, and they did as he told them.<br />
They brought in a five year old bull, flayed it, made it ready and<br />
divided it into joints; these they then cut carefully up into<br />
smaller pieces and spitted them; they roasted them sufficiently and<br />
served the portions round. Thus through the livelong day to the<br />
going down of the sun they feasted, and every man had his full share<br />
so that all were satisfied; but when the sun set and it came on<br />
dark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of sleep.<br />
When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons of<br />
Autolycus went out with their hounds hunting, and Ulysses went too.<br />
They climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached its<br />
breezy upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon the<br />
fields, fresh-risen from the slow still currents of Oceanus, they came<br />
to a mountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the tracks of<br />
the beast they were chasing, and after them came the sons of<br />
Autolycus, among whom was Ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he had a<br />
long spear in his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among some<br />
thick brushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not get through<br />
it, nor could the sun&#8217;s rays pierce it, and the ground underneath<br />
lay thick with fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men&#8217;s<br />
feet, and the hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up to<br />
him, so rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on his neck, and<br />
stood at bay with fire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was the first<br />
to raise his spear and try to drive it into the brute, but the boar<br />
was too quick for him, and charged him sideways, ripping him above the<br />
knee with a gash that tore deep though it did not reach the bone. As<br />
for the boar, Ulysses hit him on the right shoulder, and the point<br />
of the spear went right through him, so that he fell groaning in the<br />
dust until the life went out of him. The sons of Autolycus busied<br />
themselves with the carcass of the boar, and bound Ulysses&#8217; wound;<br />
then, after saying a spell to stop the bleeding, they went home as<br />
fast as they could. But when Autolycus and his sons had thoroughly<br />
healed Ulysses, they made him some splendid presents, and sent him<br />
back to Ithaca with much mutual good will. When he got back, his<br />
father and mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked him all about<br />
it, and how he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he told them how<br />
the boar had ripped him when he was out hunting with Autolycus and his<br />
sons on Mount Parnassus.<br />
As soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had<br />
well hold of it, she recognized it and dropped the foot at once. The<br />
leg fell into the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that all<br />
the water was spilt on the ground; Euryclea&#8217;s eyes between her joy and<br />
her grief filled with tears, and she could not speak, but she caught<br />
Ulysses by the beard and said, &#8220;My dear child, I am sure you must be<br />
Ulysses himself, only I did not know you till I had actually touched<br />
and handled you.&#8221;<br />
As she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting to<br />
tell her that her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was<br />
unable to look in that direction and observe what was going on, for<br />
Minerva had diverted her attention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea by<br />
the throat with his right hand and with his left drew her close to<br />
him, and said, &#8220;Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who<br />
nursed me at your own breast, now that after twenty years of wandering<br />
I am at last come to my own home again? Since it has been borne in<br />
upon you by heaven to recognize me, hold your tongue, and do not say a<br />
word about it any one else in the house, for if you do I tell you- and<br />
it shall surely be- that if heaven grants me to take the lives of<br />
these suitors, I will not spare you, though you are my own nurse, when<br />
I am killing the other women.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My child,&#8221; answered Euryclea, &#8220;what are you talking about? You know<br />
very well that nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold my<br />
tongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and<br />
lay my saying to your heart, when heaven has delivered the suitors<br />
into your hand, I will give you a list of the women in the house who<br />
have been ill-behaved, and of those who are guiltless.&#8221;<br />
And Ulysses answered, &#8220;Nurse, you ought not to speak in that way;<br />
I am well able to form my own opinion about one and all of them;<br />
hold your tongue and leave everything to heaven.&#8221;<br />
As he said this Euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water,<br />
for the first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and<br />
anointed him with oil, Ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire to<br />
warm himself, and hid the scar under his rags. Then Penelope began<br />
talking to him and said:<br />
&#8220;Stranger, I should like to speak with you briefly about another<br />
matter. It is indeed nearly bed time- for those, at least, who can<br />
sleep in spite of sorrow. As for myself, heaven has given me a life of<br />
such unmeasurable woe, that even by day when I am attending to my<br />
duties and looking after the servants, I am still weeping and<br />
lamenting during the whole time; then, when night comes, and we all of<br />
us go to bed, I lie awake thinking, and my heart comes a prey to the<br />
most incessant and cruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter of<br />
Pandareus, sings in the early spring from her seat in shadiest<br />
covert hid, and with many a plaintive trill pours out the tale how<br />
by mishap she killed her own child Itylus, son of king Zethus, even so<br />
does my mind toss and turn in its uncertainty whether I ought to<br />
stay with my son here, and safeguard my substance, my bondsmen, and<br />
the greatness of my house, out of regard to public opinion and the<br />
memory of my late husband, or whether it is not now time for me to<br />
go with the best of these suitors who are wooing me and making me such<br />
magnificent presents. As long as my son was still young, and unable to<br />
understand, he would not hear of my leaving my husband&#8217;s house, but<br />
now that he is full grown he begs and prays me to do so, being<br />
incensed at the way in which the suitors are eating up his property.<br />
Listen, then, to a dream that I have had and interpret it for me if<br />
you can. I have twenty geese about the house that eat mash out of a<br />
trough, and of which I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a great<br />
eagle came swooping down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak into<br />
the neck of each of them till he had killed them all. Presently he<br />
soared off into the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard;<br />
whereon I wept in my room till all my maids gathered round me, so<br />
piteously was I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then<br />
he came back again, and perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me<br />
with human voice, and told me to leave off crying. &#8216;Be of good<br />
courage,&#8217; he said, &#8216;daughter of Icarius; this is no dream, but a<br />
vision of good omen that shall surely come to pass. The geese are<br />
the suitors, and I am no longer an eagle, but your own husband, who am<br />
come back to you, and who will bring these suitors to a disgraceful<br />
end.&#8217; On this I woke, and when I looked out I saw my geese at the<br />
trough eating their mash as usual.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;This dream, Madam,&#8221; replied Ulysses, &#8220;can admit but of one<br />
interpretation, for had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be<br />
fulfilled? The death of the suitors is portended, and not one single<br />
one of them will escape.&#8221;<br />
And Penelope answered, &#8220;Stranger, dreams are very curious and<br />
unaccountable things, and they do not by any means invariably come<br />
true. There are two gates through which these unsubstantial fancies<br />
proceed; the one is of horn, and the other ivory. Those that come<br />
through the gate of ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of horn<br />
mean something to those that see them. I do not think, however, that<br />
my own dream came through the gate of horn, though I and my son should<br />
be most thankful if it proves to have done so. Furthermore I say-<br />
and lay my saying to your heart- the coming dawn will usher in the<br />
ill-omened day that is to sever me from the house of Ulysses, for I am<br />
about to hold a tournament of axes. My husband used to set up twelve<br />
axes in the court, one in front of the other, like the stays upon<br />
which a ship is built; he would then go back from them and shoot an<br />
arrow through the whole twelve. I shall make the suitors try to do the<br />
same thing, and whichever of them can string the bow most easily,<br />
and send his arrow through all the twelve axes, him will I follow, and<br />
quit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly and so abounding in<br />
wealth. But even so, I doubt not that I shall remember it in my<br />
dreams.&#8221;<br />
Then Ulysses answered, &#8220;Madam wife of Ulysses, you need not defer<br />
your tournament, for Ulysses will return ere ever they can string<br />
the bow, handle it how they will, and send their arrows through the<br />
iron.&#8221;<br />
To this Penelope said, &#8220;As long, sir, as you will sit here and<br />
talk to me, I can have no desire to go to bed. Still, people cannot do<br />
permanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on<br />
earth a time for all things. I will therefore go upstairs and<br />
recline upon that couch which I have never ceased to flood with my<br />
tears from the day Ulysses set out for the city with a hateful name.&#8221;<br />
She then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended by<br />
her maidens, and when there, she lamented her dear husband till<br />
Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyelids.</p>
<p>
BOOK XX</p>
<p>ULYSSES slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock&#8217;s hide, on<br />
the top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had<br />
eaten, and Eurynome threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself<br />
down. There, then, Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way in<br />
which he should kill the suitors; and by and by, the women who had<br />
been in the habit of misconducting themselves with them, left the<br />
house giggling and laughing with one another. This made Ulysses very<br />
angry, and he doubted whether to get up and kill every single one of<br />
them then and there, or to let them sleep one more and last time<br />
with the suitors. His heart growled within him, and as a bitch with<br />
puppies growls and shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, so did<br />
his heart growl with anger at the evil deeds that were being done: but<br />
he beat his breast and said, &#8220;Heart, be still, you had worse than this<br />
to bear on the day when the terrible Cyclops ate your brave<br />
companions; yet you bore it in silence till your cunning got you<br />
safe out of the cave, though you made sure of being killed.&#8221;<br />
Thus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but he<br />
tossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in<br />
front of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other,<br />
that he may get it cooked as soon as possible, even so did he turn<br />
himself about from side to side, thinking all the time how, single<br />
handed as he was, he should contrive to kill so large a body of men as<br />
the wicked suitors. But by and by Minerva came down from heaven in the<br />
likeness of a woman, and hovered over his head saying, &#8220;My poor<br />
unhappy man, why do you lie awake in this way? This is your house:<br />
your wife is safe inside it, and so is your son who is just such a<br />
young man as any father may be proud of.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Goddess,&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;all that you have said is true, but<br />
I am in some doubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked<br />
suitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there always<br />
are. And there is this further difficulty, which is still more<br />
considerable. Supposing that with Jove&#8217;s and your assistance I succeed<br />
in killing them, I must ask you to consider where I am to escape to<br />
from their avengers when it is all over.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;For shame,&#8221; replied Minerva, &#8220;why, any one else would trust a worse<br />
ally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less<br />
wise than I am. Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected you<br />
throughout in all your troubles? I tell you plainly that even though<br />
there were fifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us, you<br />
should take all their sheep and cattle, and drive them away with<br />
you. But go to sleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all night,<br />
and you shall be out of your troubles before long.&#8221;<br />
As she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to<br />
Olympus.<br />
While Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber<br />
that eased the burden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, and<br />
sitting up in her bed began to cry. When she had relieved herself by<br />
weeping she prayed to Diana saying, &#8220;Great Goddess Diana, daughter<br />
of Jove, drive an arrow into my heart and slay me; or let some<br />
whirlwind snatch me up and bear me through paths of darkness till it<br />
drop me into the mouths of overflowing Oceanus, as it did the<br />
daughters of Pandareus. The daughters of Pandareus lost their father<br />
and mother, for the gods killed them, so they were left orphans. But<br />
Venus took care of them, and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet<br />
wine. Juno taught them to excel all women in beauty of form and<br />
understanding; Diana gave them an imposing presence, and Minerva<br />
endowed them with every kind of accomplishment; but one day when Venus<br />
had gone up to Olympus to see Jove about getting them married (for<br />
well does he know both what shall happen and what not happen to<br />
every one) the storm winds came and spirited them away to become<br />
handmaids to the dread Erinyes. Even so I wish that the gods who<br />
live in heaven would hide me from mortal sight, or that fair Diana<br />
might strike me, for I would fain go even beneath the sad earth if I<br />
might do so still looking towards Ulysses only, and without having<br />
to yield myself to a worse man than he was. Besides, no matter how<br />
much people may grieve by day, they can put up with it so long as they<br />
can sleep at night, for when the eyes are closed in slumber people<br />
forget good and ill alike; whereas my misery haunts me even in my<br />
dreams. This very night methought there was one lying by my side who<br />
was like Ulysses as he was when he went away with his host, and I<br />
rejoiced, for I believed that it was no dream, but the very truth<br />
itself.&#8221;<br />
On this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping,<br />
and it puzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and<br />
was by his side. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on<br />
which he had lain, and set them on a seat in the cloister, but he took<br />
the bullock&#8217;s hide out into the open. He lifted up his hands to<br />
heaven, and prayed, saying &#8220;Father Jove, since you have seen fit to<br />
bring me over land and sea to my own home after all the afflictions<br />
you have laid upon me, give me a sign out of the mouth of some one<br />
or other of those who are now waking within the house, and let me have<br />
another sign of some kind from outside.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high<br />
up among the from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad<br />
when he heard it. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman<br />
from hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another<br />
sign. There were twelve miller-women whose business it was to grind<br />
wheat and barley which are the staff of life. The others had ground<br />
their task and had gone to take their rest, but this one had not yet<br />
finished, for she was not so strong as they were, and when she heard<br />
the thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to her master.<br />
&#8220;Father Jove,&#8221; said she, &#8220;you who rule over heaven and earth, you have<br />
thundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it, and<br />
this means something for somebody; grant the prayer, then, of me<br />
your poor servant who calls upon you, and let this be the very last<br />
day that the suitors dine in the house of Ulysses. They have worn me<br />
out with the labour of grinding meal for them, and I hope they may<br />
never have another dinner anywhere at all.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the<br />
woman&#8217;s speech, and by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he<br />
should avenge himself on the suitors.<br />
Then the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the<br />
hearth; Telemachus also rose and put on his clothes. He girded his<br />
sword about his shoulder, bound his sandals on his comely feet, and<br />
took a doughty spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to<br />
the threshold of the cloister and said to Euryclea, &#8220;Nurse, did you<br />
make the stranger comfortable both as regards bed and board, or did<br />
you let him shift for himself?- for my mother, good woman though she<br />
is, has a way of paying great attention to second-rate people, and<br />
of neglecting others who are in reality much better men.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Do not find fault child,&#8221; said Euryclea, &#8220;when there is no one to<br />
find fault with. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he<br />
liked: your mother did ask him if he would take any more bread and<br />
he said he would not. When he wanted to go to bed she told the<br />
servants to make one for him, but he said he was re such wretched<br />
outcast that he would not sleep on a bed and under blankets; he<br />
insisted on having an undressed bullock&#8217;s hide and some sheepskins put<br />
for him in the cloister and I threw a cloak over him myself.&#8221;<br />
Then Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the<br />
Achaeans were meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and<br />
he was not alone, for his two dogs went with him. But Euryclea<br />
called the maids and said, &#8220;Come, wake up; set about sweeping the<br />
cloisters and sprinkling them with water to lay the dust; put the<br />
covers on the seats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a wet<br />
sponge; clean out the mixing-jugs and the cups, and for water from the<br />
fountain at once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here<br />
early, for it is a feast day.&#8221;<br />
Thus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of<br />
them went to the fountain for water, and the others set themselves<br />
busily to work about the house. The men who were in attendance on<br />
the suitors also came up and began chopping firewood. By and by the<br />
women returned from the fountain, and the swineherd came after them<br />
with the three best pigs he could pick out. These he let feed about<br />
the premises, and then he said good-humouredly to Ulysses,<br />
&#8220;Stranger, are the suitors treating you any better now, or are they as<br />
insolent as ever?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;May heaven,&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;requite to them the wickedness with<br />
which they deal high-handedly in another man&#8217;s house without any sense<br />
of shame.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up,<br />
for he too was bringing in his best goats for the suitors&#8217; dinner; and<br />
he had two shepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the<br />
gatehouse, and then Melanthius began gibing at Ulysses. &#8220;Are you still<br />
here, stranger,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to pester people by begging about the<br />
house? Why can you not go elsewhere? You and I shall not come to an<br />
understanding before we have given each other a taste of our fists.<br />
You beg without any sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhere<br />
among the Achaeans, as well as here?&#8221;<br />
Ulysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third<br />
man, Philoetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer<br />
and some goats. These were brought over by the boatmen who are there<br />
to take people over when any one comes to them. So Philoetius made his<br />
heifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went up to<br />
the swineherd. &#8220;Who, Swineherd,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is this stranger that is<br />
lately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his family? Where<br />
does he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some<br />
great man, but the gods give sorrow to whom they will- even to kings<br />
if it so pleases them<br />
As he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right<br />
hand; &#8220;Good day to you, father stranger,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you seem to be<br />
very poorly off now, but I hope you will have better times by and<br />
by. Father Jove, of all gods you are the most malicious. We are your<br />
own children, yet you show us no mercy in all our misery and<br />
afflictions. A sweat came over me when I saw this man, and my eyes<br />
filled with tears, for he reminds me of Ulysses, who I fear is going<br />
about in just such rags as this man&#8217;s are, if indeed he is still among<br />
the living. If he is already dead and in the house of Hades, then,<br />
alas! for my good master, who made me his stockman when I was quite<br />
young among the Cephallenians, and now his cattle are countless; no<br />
one could have done better with them than I have, for they have bred<br />
like ears of corn; nevertheless I have to keep bringing them in for<br />
others to eat, who take no heed of his son though he is in the<br />
house, and fear not the wrath of heaven, but are already eager to<br />
divide Ulysses&#8217; property among them because he has been away so<br />
long. I have often thought- only it would not be right while his son<br />
is living- of going off with the cattle to some foreign country; bad<br />
as this would be, it is still harder to stay here and be ill-treated<br />
about other people&#8217;s herds. My position is intolerable, and I should<br />
long since have run away and put myself under the protection of some<br />
other chief, only that I believe my poor master will yet return, and<br />
send all these suitors flying out of the house.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Stockman,&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;you seem to be a very well-disposed<br />
person, and I can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will<br />
tell you, and will confirm my words with an oath: by Jove, the chief<br />
of all gods, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I am now come,<br />
Ulysses shall return before you leave this place, and if you are so<br />
minded you shall see him killing the suitors who are now masters<br />
here.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;If Jove were to bring this to pass,&#8221; replied the stockman, &#8220;you<br />
should see how I would do my very utmost to help him.&#8221;<br />
And in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.<br />
Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot<br />
to murder Telemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand- an<br />
eagle with a dove in its talons. On this Amphinomus said, &#8220;My friends,<br />
this plot of ours to murder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go<br />
to dinner instead.&#8221;<br />
The others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks on<br />
the benches and seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the<br />
heifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served them<br />
round. They mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls, and the swineherd gave<br />
every man his cup, while Philoetius handed round the bread in the<br />
breadbaskets, and Melanthius poured them out their wine. Then they<br />
laid their hands upon the good things that were before them.<br />
Telemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister<br />
that was paved with stone; he gave him a shabby-looking seat at a<br />
little table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats<br />
brought to him, with his wine in a gold cup. &#8220;Sit there,&#8221; said he,<br />
&#8220;and drink your wine among the great people. I will put a stop to<br />
the gibes and blows of the suitors, for this is no public house, but<br />
belongs to Ulysses, and has passed from him to me. Therefore, suitors,<br />
keep your hands and your tongues to yourselves, or there will be<br />
mischief.&#8221;<br />
The suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his<br />
speech; then Antinous said, &#8220;We do not like such language but we<br />
will put up with it, for Telemachus is threatening us in good earnest.<br />
If Jove had let us we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere<br />
now.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the<br />
heralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and the<br />
Achaeans gathered under the shady grove of Apollo.<br />
Then they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave<br />
every man his portion, and feasted to their hearts&#8217; content; those who<br />
waited at table gave Ulysses exactly the same portion as the others<br />
had, for Telemachus had told them to do so.<br />
But Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their<br />
insolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become still more bitter<br />
against them. Now there happened to be among them a ribald fellow,<br />
whose name was Ctesippus, and who came from Same. This man,<br />
confident in his great wealth, was paying court to the wife of<br />
Ulysses, and said to the suitors, &#8220;Hear what I have to say. The<br />
stranger has already had as large a portion as any one else; this is<br />
well, for it is not right nor reasonable to ill-treat any guest of<br />
Telemachus who comes here. I will, however, make him a present on my<br />
own account, that he may have something to give to the bath-woman,<br />
or to some other of Ulysses&#8217; servants.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he picked up a heifer&#8217;s foot from the meat-basket in<br />
which it lay, and threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a<br />
little aside, and avoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion as he<br />
did so, and it hit the wall, not him. On this Telemachus spoke<br />
fiercely to Ctesippus, &#8220;It is a good thing for you,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that<br />
the stranger turned his head so that you missed him. If you had hit<br />
him I should have run you through with my spear, and your father would<br />
have had to see about getting you buried rather than married in this<br />
house. So let me have no more unseemly behaviour from any of you,<br />
for I am grown up now to the knowledge of good and evil and understand<br />
what is going on, instead of being the child that I have been<br />
heretofore. I have long seen you killing my sheep and making free with<br />
my corn and wine: I have put up with this, for one man is no match for<br />
many, but do me no further violence. Still, if you wish to kill me,<br />
kill me; I would far rather die than see such disgraceful scenes day<br />
after day- guests insulted, and men dragging the women servants<br />
about the house in an unseemly way.&#8221;<br />
They all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said,<br />
&#8220;No one should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay<br />
it, for it is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the<br />
stranger, or any one else of the servants who are about the house; I<br />
would say, however, a friendly word to Telemachus and his mother,<br />
which I trust may commend itself to both. &#8216;As long,&#8217; I would say,<br />
&#8216;as you had ground for hoping that Ulysses would one day come home, no<br />
one could complain of your waiting and suffering the suitors to be<br />
in your house. It would have been better that he should have returned,<br />
but it is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore<br />
talk all this quietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry the<br />
best man, and the one who makes her the most advantageous offer.<br />
Thus you will yourself be able to manage your own inheritance, and<br />
to eat and drink in peace, while your mother will look after some<br />
other man&#8217;s house, not yours.&#8221;&#8216;<br />
To this Telemachus answered, &#8220;By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows<br />
of my unhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca, or is<br />
wandering in some distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way of<br />
my mother&#8217;s marriage; on the contrary I urge her to choose<br />
whomsoever she will, and I will give her numberless gifts into the<br />
bargain, but I dare not insist point blank that she shall leave the<br />
house against her own wishes. Heaven forbid that I should do this.&#8221;<br />
Minerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, and<br />
set their wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forced<br />
laughter. Their meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled with<br />
tears, and their hearts were heavy with forebodings. Theoclymenus<br />
saw this and said, &#8220;Unhappy men, what is it that ails you? There is<br />
a shroud of darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your cheeks are<br />
wet with tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and<br />
roof-beams drip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court<br />
beyond them are full of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell;<br />
the sun is blotted out of heaven, and a blighting gloom is over all<br />
the land.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus<br />
then said, &#8220;This stranger who has lately come here has lost his<br />
senses. Servants, turn him out into the streets, since he finds it<br />
so dark here.&#8221;<br />
But Theoclymenus said, &#8220;Eurymachus, you need not send any one with<br />
me. I have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing of<br />
an understanding mind. I will take these out of the house with me, for<br />
I see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you men who<br />
are insulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysses<br />
will be able to escape.&#8221;<br />
He left the house as he spoke, and went back to Piraeus who gave him<br />
welcome, but the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking<br />
Telemachus fly laughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said<br />
to him, &#8220;Telemachus, you are not happy in your guests; first you<br />
have this importunate tramp, who comes begging bread and wine and<br />
has no skill for work or for hard fighting, but is perfectly<br />
useless, and now here is another fellow who is setting himself up as a<br />
prophet. Let me persuade you, for it will be much better, to put<br />
them on board ship and send them off to the Sicels to sell for what<br />
they will bring.&#8221;<br />
Telemachus gave him no heed, but sat silently watching his father,<br />
expecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon the<br />
suitors.<br />
Meanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had had a rich<br />
seat placed for her facing the court and cloisters, so that she<br />
could hear what every one was saying. The dinner indeed had been<br />
prepared amid merriment; it had been both good and abundant, for<br />
they had sacrificed many victims; but the supper was yet to come,<br />
and nothing can be conceived more gruesome than the meal which a<br />
goddess and a brave man were soon to lay before them- for they had<br />
brought their doom upon themselves.</p>
