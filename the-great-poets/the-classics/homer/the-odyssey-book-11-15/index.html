				<p>BOOK XI</p>
<p>THEN, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into<br />
the water and got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep<br />
on board and took our places, weeping and in great distress of mind.<br />
Circe, that great and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew<br />
dead aft and stayed steadily with us keeping our sails all the time<br />
well filled; so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship&#8217;s gear and<br />
let her go as the wind and helmsman headed her. All day long her sails<br />
were full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun went<br />
down and darkness was over all the earth, we got into the deep<br />
waters of the river Oceanus, where lie the land and city of the<br />
Cimmerians who live enshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays<br />
of the sun never pierce neither at his rising nor as he goes down<br />
again out of the heavens, but the poor wretches live in one long<br />
melancholy night. When we got there we beached the ship, took the<br />
sheep out of her, and went along by the waters of Oceanus till we came<br />
to the place of which Circe had told us.<br />
&#8220;Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my<br />
sword and dug the trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offering<br />
to all the dead, first with honey and milk, then with wine, and<br />
thirdly with water, and I sprinkled white barley meal over the<br />
whole, praying earnestly to the poor feckless ghosts, and promising<br />
them that when I got back to Ithaca I would sacrifice a barren<br />
heifer for them, the best I had, and would load the pyre with good<br />
things. I also particularly promised that Teiresias should have a<br />
black sheep to himself, the best in all my flocks. When I had prayed<br />
sufficiently to the dead, I cut the throats of the two sheep and let<br />
the blood run into the trench, whereon the ghosts came trooping up<br />
from Erebus- brides, young bachelors, old men worn out with toil,<br />
maids who had been crossed in love, and brave men who had been<br />
killed in battle, with their armour still smirched with blood; they<br />
came from every quarter and flitted round the trench with a strange<br />
kind of screaming sound that made me turn pale with fear. When I saw<br />
them coming I told the men to be quick and flay the carcasses of the<br />
two dead sheep and make burnt offerings of them, and at the same<br />
time to repeat prayers to Hades and to Proserpine; but I sat where I<br />
was with my sword drawn and would not let the poor feckless ghosts<br />
come near the blood till Teiresias should have answered my questions.<br />
&#8220;The first ghost &#8216;that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for he<br />
had not yet been laid beneath the earth. We had left his body<br />
unwaked and unburied in Circe&#8217;s house, for we had had too much else to<br />
do. I was very sorry for him, and cried when I saw him: &#8216;Elpenor,&#8217;<br />
said I, &#8216;how did you come down here into this gloom and darkness?<br />
You have here on foot quicker than I have with my ship.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Sir,&#8217; he answered with a groan, &#8216;it was all bad luck, and my own<br />
unspeakable drunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe&#8217;s<br />
house, and never thought of coming down again by the great staircase<br />
but fell right off the roof and broke my neck, so my soul down to<br />
the house of Hades. And now I beseech you by all those whom you have<br />
left behind you, though they are not here, by your wife, by the father<br />
who brought you up when you were a child, and by Telemachus who is the<br />
one hope of your house, do what I shall now ask you. I know that<br />
when you leave this limbo you will again hold your ship for the Aeaean<br />
island. Do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you,<br />
or I may bring heaven&#8217;s anger upon you; but burn me with whatever<br />
armour I have, build a barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tell<br />
people in days to come what a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plant<br />
over my grave the oar I used to row with when I was yet alive and with<br />
my messmates.&#8217; And I said, &#8216;My poor fellow, I will do all that you<br />
have asked of me.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on the<br />
one side of the trench with my sword held over the blood, and the<br />
ghost of my comrade saying all this to me from the other side. Then<br />
came the ghost of my dead mother Anticlea, daughter to Autolycus. I<br />
had left her alive when I set out for Troy and was moved to tears when<br />
I saw her, but even so, for all my sorrow I would not let her come<br />
near the blood till I had asked my questions of Teiresias.<br />
&#8220;Then came also the ghost of Theban Teiresias, with his golden<br />
sceptre in his hand. He knew me and said, &#8216;Ulysses, noble son of<br />
Laertes, why, poor man, have you left the light of day and come down<br />
to visit the dead in this sad place? Stand back from the trench and<br />
withdraw your sword that I may drink of the blood and answer your<br />
questions truly.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;So I drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank of<br />
the blood he began with his prophecy.<br />
&#8220;You want to know,&#8217; said he, &#8216;about your return home, but heaven<br />
will make this hard for you. I do not think that you will escape the<br />
eye of Neptune, who still nurses his bitter grudge against you for<br />
having blinded his son. Still, after much suffering you may get home<br />
if you can restrain yourself and your companions when your ship<br />
reaches the Thrinacian island, where you will find the sheep and<br />
cattle belonging to the sun, who sees and gives ear to everything.<br />
If you leave these flocks unharmed and think of nothing but of getting<br />
home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm<br />
them, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and<br />
of your men. Even though you may yourself escape, you will return in<br />
bad plight after losing all your men, [in another man's ship, and<br />
you will find trouble in your house, which will be overrun by<br />
high-handed people, who are devouring your substance under the pretext<br />
of paying court and making presents to your wife.<br />
"'When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; and<br />
after you have killed them by force or fraud in your own house, you<br />
must take a well-made oar and carry it on and on, till you come to a<br />
country where the people have never heard of the sea and do not even<br />
mix salt with their food, nor do they know anything about ships, and<br />
oars that are as the wings of a ship. I will give you this certain<br />
token which cannot escape your notice. A wayfarer will meet you and<br />
will say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your<br />
shoulder; on this you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice a<br />
ram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune. Then go home and offer hecatombs<br />
to an the gods in heaven one after the other. As for yourself, death<br />
shall come to you from the sea, and your life shall ebb away very<br />
gently when you are full of years and peace of mind, and your people<br />
shall bless you. All that I have said will come true].&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;This,&#8217; I answered, &#8216;must be as it may please heaven, but tell me<br />
and tell me and tell me true, I see my poor mother&#8217;s ghost close by<br />
us; she is sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though I am<br />
her own son she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me, Sir,<br />
how I can make her know me.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;That,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I can soon do Any ghost that you let taste of the<br />
blood will talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do not<br />
let them have any blood they will go away again.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;On this the ghost of Teiresias went back to the house of Hades, for<br />
his prophecyings had now been spoken, but I sat still where I was<br />
until my mother came up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at once<br />
and spoke fondly to me, saying, &#8216;My son, how did you come down to this<br />
abode of darkness while you are still alive? It is a hard thing for<br />
the living to see these places, for between us and them there are<br />
great and terrible waters, and there is Oceanus, which no man can<br />
cross on foot, but he must have a good ship to take him. Are you all<br />
this time trying to find your way home from Troy, and have you never<br />
yet got back to Ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Mother,&#8217; said I, &#8216;I was forced to come here to consult the ghost<br />
of the Theban prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near the<br />
Achaean land nor set foot on my native country, and I have had nothing<br />
but one long series of misfortunes from the very first day that I<br />
set out with Agamemnon for Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight<br />
the Trojans. But tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die?<br />
Did you have a long illness, or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle easy<br />
passage to eternity? Tell me also about my father, and the son whom<br />
I left behind me; is my property still in their hands, or has some one<br />
else got hold of it, who thinks that I shall not return to claim it?<br />
Tell me again what my wife intends doing, and in what mind she is;<br />
does she live with my son and guard my estate securely, or has she<br />
made the best match she could and married again?&#8217;<br />
&#8220;My mother answered, &#8216;Your wife still remains in your house, but she<br />
is in great distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both<br />
night and day. No one as yet has got possession of your fine property,<br />
and Telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertain<br />
largely, as of course he must, considering his position as a<br />
magistrate, and how every one invites him; your father remains at<br />
his old place in the country and never goes near the town. He has no<br />
comfortable bed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in<br />
front of the fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but in<br />
summer, when the warm weather comes on again, he lies out in the<br />
vineyard on a bed of vine leaves thrown anyhow upon the ground. He<br />
grieves continually about your never having come home, and suffers<br />
more and more as he grows older. As for my own end it was in this<br />
wise: heaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my own house,<br />
nor was I attacked by any illness such as those that generally wear<br />
people out and kill them, but my longing to know what you were doing<br />
and the force of my affection for you- this it was that was the<br />
death of me.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Then I tried to find some way of embracing my mother&#8217;s ghost.<br />
Thrice I sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but<br />
each time she flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom,<br />
and being touched to the quick I said to her, &#8216;Mother, why do you<br />
not stay still when I would embrace you? If we could throw our arms<br />
around one another we might find sad comfort in the sharing of our<br />
sorrows even in the house of Hades; does Proserpine want to lay a<br />
still further load of grief upon me by mocking me with a phantom<br />
only?&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;My son,&#8217; she answered, &#8216;most ill-fated of all mankind, it is not<br />
Proserpine that is beguiling you, but all people are like this when<br />
they are dead. The sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together;<br />
these perish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has<br />
left the body, and the soul flits away as though it were a dream. Now,<br />
however, go back to the light of day as soon as you can, and note<br />
all these things that you may tell them to your wife hereafter.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Thus did we converse, and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of the<br />
wives and daughters of all the most famous men. They gathered in<br />
crowds about the blood, and I considered how I might question them<br />
severally. In the end I deemed that it would be best to draw the<br />
keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from all<br />
drinking the blood at once. So they came up one after the other, and<br />
each one as I questioned her told me her race and lineage.<br />
&#8220;The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of<br />
Cretheus the son of Aeolus. She fell in love with the river Enipeus<br />
who is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she<br />
was taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as her<br />
lover, lay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue wave<br />
arched itself like a mountain over them to hide both woman and god,<br />
whereon he loosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber.<br />
When the god had accomplished the deed of love, he took her hand in<br />
his own and said, &#8216;Tyro, rejoice in all good will; the embraces of the<br />
gods are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about this time<br />
twelve months. Take great care of them. I am Neptune, so now go<br />
home, but hold your tongue and do not tell any one.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias<br />
and Neleus, who both of them served Jove with all their might.<br />
Pelias was a great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other<br />
lived in Pylos. The rest of her children were by Cretheus, namely,<br />
Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon, who was a mighty warrior and charioteer.<br />
&#8220;Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asopus, who could boast of<br />
having slept in the arms of even Jove himself, and who bore him two<br />
sons Amphion and Zethus. These founded Thebes with its seven gates,<br />
and built a wall all round it; for strong though they were they<br />
could not hold Thebes till they had walled it.<br />
&#8220;Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, who also bore to Jove<br />
indomitable Hercules; and Megara who was daughter to great King Creon,<br />
and married the redoubtable son of Amphitryon.<br />
&#8220;I also saw fair Epicaste mother of king OEdipodes whose awful lot<br />
it was to marry her own son without suspecting it. He married her<br />
after having killed his father, but the gods proclaimed the whole<br />
story to the world; whereon he remained king of Thebes, in great grief<br />
for the spite the gods had borne him; but Epicaste went to the house<br />
of the mighty jailor Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and the<br />
avenging spirits haunted him as for an outraged mother- to his ruing<br />
bitterly thereafter.<br />
&#8220;Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having<br />
given priceless presents for her. She was youngest daughter to Amphion<br />
son of Iasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos.<br />
She bore Nestor, Chromius, and Periclymenus, and she also bore that<br />
marvellously lovely woman Pero, who was wooed by all the country<br />
round; but Neleus would only give her to him who should raid the<br />
cattle of Iphicles from the grazing grounds of Phylace, and this was a<br />
hard task. The only man who would undertake to raid them was a certain<br />
excellent seer, but the will of heaven was against him, for the<br />
rangers of the cattle caught him and put him in prison; nevertheless<br />
when a full year had passed and the same season came round again,<br />
Iphicles set him at liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles of<br />
heaven. Thus, then, was the will of Jove accomplished.<br />
&#8220;And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, who bore him two famous<br />
sons, Castor breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both<br />
these heroes are lying under the earth, though they are still alive,<br />
for by a special dispensation of Jove, they die and come to life<br />
again, each one of them every other day throughout all time, and<br />
they have the rank of gods.<br />
&#8220;After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who boasted the embrace<br />
of Neptune. She bore two sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both were<br />
short lived. They were the finest children that were ever born in this<br />
world, and the best looking, Orion only excepted; for at nine years<br />
old they were nine fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round the<br />
chest. They threatened to make war with the gods in Olympus, and tried<br />
to set Mount Ossa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount Pelion on the<br />
top of Ossa, that they might scale heaven itself, and they would<br />
have done it too if they had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto,<br />
killed both of them, before they had got so much as a sign of hair<br />
upon their cheeks or chin.<br />
&#8220;Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the<br />
magician Minos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to Athens,<br />
but he did not enjoy her, for before he could do so Diana killed her<br />
in the island of Dia on account of what Bacchus had said against her.<br />
&#8220;I also saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, who sold her own<br />
husband for gold. But it would take me all night if I were to name<br />
every single one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw,<br />
and it is time for me to go to bed, either on board ship with my crew,<br />
or here. As for my escort, heaven and yourselves will see to it.&#8221;<br />
Here he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and<br />
speechless throughout the covered cloister. Then Arete said to them:<br />
&#8220;What do you think of this man, O Phaecians? Is he not tall and good<br />
looking, and is he not Clever? True, he is my own guest, but all of<br />
you share in the distinction. Do not he a hurry to send him away,<br />
nor niggardly in the presents you make to one who is in such great<br />
need, for heaven has blessed all of you with great abundance.&#8221;<br />
Then spoke the aged hero Echeneus who was one of the oldest men<br />
among them, &#8220;My friends,&#8221; said he, &#8220;what our august queen has just<br />
said to us is both reasonable and to the purpose, therefore be<br />
persuaded by it; but the decision whether in word or deed rests<br />
ultimately with King Alcinous.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The thing shall be done,&#8221; exclaimed Alcinous, &#8220;as surely as I still<br />
live and reign over the Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxious<br />
to get home, still we must persuade him to remain with us until<br />
to-morrow, by which time I shall be able to get together the whole sum<br />
that I mean to give him. As regards- his escort it will be a matter<br />
for you all, and mine above all others as the chief person among you.&#8221;<br />
And Ulysses answered, &#8220;King Alcinous, if you were to bid me to<br />
stay here for a whole twelve months, and then speed me on my way,<br />
loaded with your noble gifts, I should obey you gladly and it would<br />
redound greatly to my advantage, for I should return fuller-handed<br />
to my own people, and should thus be more respected and beloved by all<br />
who see me when I get back to Ithaca.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Ulysses,&#8221; replied Alcinous, &#8220;not one of us who sees you has any<br />
idea that you are a charlatan or a swindler. I know there are many<br />
people going about who tell such plausible stories that it is very<br />
hard to see through them, but there is a style about your language<br />
which assures me of your good disposition. Moreover you have told<br />
the story of your own misfortunes, and those of the Argives, as though<br />
you were a practised bard; but tell me, and tell me true, whether<br />
you saw any of the mighty heroes who went to Troy at the same time<br />
with yourself, and perished there. The evenings are still at their<br />
longest, and it is not yet bed time- go on, therefore, with your<br />
divine story, for I could stay here listening till to-morrow<br />
morning, so long as you will continue to tell us of your adventures.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Alcinous,&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;there is a time for making<br />
speeches, and a time for going to bed; nevertheless, since you so<br />
desire, I will not refrain from telling you the still sadder tale of<br />
those of my comrades who did not fall fighting with the Trojans, but<br />
perished on their return, through the treachery of a wicked woman.<br />
&#8220;When Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all<br />
directions, the ghost of Agamemnon son of Atreus came sadly up tome,<br />
surrounded by those who had perished with him in the house of<br />
Aegisthus. As soon as he had tasted the blood he knew me, and<br />
weeping bitterly stretched out his arms towards me to embrace me;<br />
but he had no strength nor substance any more, and I too wept and<br />
pitied him as I beheld him. &#8216;How did you come by your death,&#8217; said<br />
I, &#8216;King Agamemnon? Did Neptune raise his winds and waves against<br />
you when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end of you on<br />
the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or<br />
while they were fighting in defence of their wives and city?&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Ulysses,&#8217; he answered, &#8216;noble son of Laertes, was not lost at<br />
sea in any storm of Neptune&#8217;s raising, nor did my foes despatch me<br />
upon the mainland, but Aegisthus and my wicked wife were the death<br />
of me between them. He asked me to his house, feasted me, and then<br />
butchered me most miserably as though I were a fat beast in a<br />
slaughter house, while all around me my comrades were slain like sheep<br />
or pigs for the wedding breakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of<br />
some great nobleman. You must have seen numbers of men killed either<br />
in a general engagement, or in single combat, but you never saw<br />
anything so truly pitiable as the way in which we fell in that<br />
cloister, with the mixing-bowl and the loaded tables lying all<br />
about, and the ground reeking with our-blood. I heard Priam&#8217;s daughter<br />
Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her close beside me. I lay<br />
dying upon the earth with the sword in my body, and raised my hands to<br />
kill the slut of a murderess, but she slipped away from me; she<br />
would not even close my lips nor my eyes when I was dying, for there<br />
is nothing in this world so cruel and so shameless as a woman when she<br />
has fallen into such guilt as hers was. Fancy murdering her own<br />
husband! I thought I was going to be welcomed home by my children<br />
and my servants, but her abominable crime has brought disgrace on<br />
herself and all women who shall come after- even on the good ones.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;And I said, &#8216;In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first<br />
to last in the matter of their women&#8217;s counsels. See how many of us<br />
fell for Helen&#8217;s sake, and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched<br />
mischief against too during your absence.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Be sure, therefore,&#8217; continued Agamemnon, &#8216;and not be too friendly<br />
even with your own wife. Do not tell her all that you know perfectly<br />
well yourself. Tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel about<br />
the rest. Not that your wife, Ulysses, is likely to murder you, for<br />
Penelope is a very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. We<br />
left her a young bride with an infant at her breast when we set out<br />
for Troy. This child no doubt is now grown up happily to man&#8217;s estate,<br />
and he and his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one<br />
another as it is right they should do, whereas my wicked wife did<br />
not even allow me the happiness of looking upon my son, but killed<br />
me ere I could do so. Furthermore I say- and lay my saying to your<br />
heart- do not tell people when you are bringing your ship to Ithaca,<br />
but steal a march upon them, for after all this there is no trusting<br />
women. But now tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any news<br />
of my son Orestes? Is he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at<br />
Sparta with Menelaus- for I presume that he is still living.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;And I said, &#8216;Agamemnon, why do you ask me? I do not know whether<br />
your son is alive or dead, and it is not right to talk when one does<br />
not know.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;As we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another the<br />
ghost of Achilles came up to us with Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax<br />
who was the finest and goodliest man of all the Danaans after the<br />
son of Peleus. The fleet descendant of Aeacus knew me and spoke<br />
piteously, saying, &#8216;Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, what deed of daring<br />
will you undertake next, that you venture down to the house of Hades<br />
among us silly dead, who are but the ghosts of them that can labour no<br />
more?&#8217;<br />
&#8220;And I said, &#8216;Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the<br />
Achaeans, I came to consult Teiresias, and see if he could advise me<br />
about my return home to Ithaca, for I have never yet been able to<br />
get near the Achaean land, nor to set foot in my own country, but have<br />
been in trouble all the time. As for you, Achilles, no one was ever<br />
yet so fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be, for you were<br />
adored by all us Argives as long as you were alive, and now that you<br />
are here you are a great prince among the dead. Do not, therefore,<br />
take it so much to heart even if you are dead.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Say not a word,&#8217; he answered, &#8216;in death&#8217;s favour; I would rather<br />
be a paid servant in a poor man&#8217;s house and be above ground than<br />
king of kings among the dead. But give me news about son; is he gone<br />
to the wars and will he be a great soldier, or is this not so? Tell me<br />
also if you have heard anything about my father Peleus- does he<br />
still rule among the Myrmidons, or do they show him no respect<br />
throughout Hellas and Phthia now that he is old and his limbs fail<br />
him? Could I but stand by his side, in the light of day, with the same<br />
strength that I had when I killed the bravest of our foes upon the<br />
plain of Troy- could I but be as I then was and go even for a short<br />
time to my father&#8217;s house, any one who tried to do him violence or<br />
supersede him would soon me it.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;I have heard nothing,&#8217; I answered, &#8216;of Peleus, but I can tell<br />
you all about your son Neoptolemus, for I took him in my own ship from<br />
Scyros with the Achaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was<br />
always first to speak, and his judgement was unerring. Nestor and I<br />
were the only two who could surpass him; and when it came to<br />
fighting on the plain of Troy, he would never remain with the body<br />
of his men, but would dash on far in front, foremost of them all in<br />
valour. Many a man did he kill in battle- I cannot name every single<br />
one of those whom he slew while fighting on the side of the Argives,<br />
but will only say how he killed that valiant hero Eurypylus son of<br />
Telephus, who was the handsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many<br />
others also of the Ceteians fell around him by reason of a woman&#8217;s<br />
bribes. Moreover, when all the bravest of the Argives went inside<br />
the horse that Epeus had made, and it was left to me to settle when we<br />
should either open the door of our ambuscade, or close it, though<br />
all the other leaders and chief men among the Danaans were drying<br />
their eyes and quaking in every limb, I never once saw him turn pale<br />
nor wipe a tear from his cheek; he was all the time urging me to break<br />
out from the horse- grasping the handle of his sword and his<br />
bronze-shod spear, and breathing fury against the foe. Yet when we had<br />
sacked the city of Priam he got his handsome share of the prize<br />
money and went on board (such is the fortune of war) without a wound<br />
upon him, neither from a thrown spear nor in close combat, for the<br />
rage of Mars is a matter of great chance.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across a<br />
meadow full of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning<br />
the prowess of his son.<br />
&#8220;The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own<br />
melancholy tale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof-<br />
still angry with me for having won the cause in our dispute about<br />
the armour of Achilles. Thetis had offered it as a prize, but the<br />
Trojan prisoners and Minerva were the judges. Would that I had never<br />
gained the day in such a contest, for it cost the life of Ajax, who<br />
was foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike in<br />
stature and prowess.<br />
&#8220;When I saw him I tried to pacify him and said, &#8216;Ajax, will you<br />
not forget and forgive even in death, but must the judgement about<br />
that hateful armour still rankle with you? It cost us Argives dear<br />
enough to lose such a tower of strength as you were to us. We<br />
mourned you as much as we mourned Achilles son of Peleus himself,<br />
nor can the blame be laid on anything but on the spite which Jove bore<br />
against the Danaans, for it was this that made him counsel your<br />
destruction- come hither, therefore, bring your proud spirit into<br />
subjection, and hear what I can tell you.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;He would not answer, but turned away to Erebus and to the other<br />
ghosts; nevertheless, I should have made him talk to me in spite of<br />
his being so angry, or I should have gone talking to him, only that<br />
there were still others among the dead whom I desired to see.<br />
&#8220;Then I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his hand<br />
sitting in judgement on the dead, and the ghosts were gathered sitting<br />
and standing round him in the spacious house of Hades, to learn his<br />
sentences upon them.<br />
&#8220;After him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the<br />
ghosts of the wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, and<br />
he had a great bronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.<br />
&#8220;And I saw Tityus son of Gaia stretched upon the plain and<br />
covering some nine acres of ground. Two vultures on either side of him<br />
were digging their beaks into his liver, and he kept on trying to beat<br />
them off with his hands, but could not; for he had violated Jove&#8217;s<br />
mistress Leto as she was going through Panopeus on her way to Pytho.<br />
&#8220;I saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus, who stood in a lake<br />
that reached his chin; he was dying to quench his thirst, but could<br />
never reach the water, for whenever the poor creature stooped to<br />
drink, it dried up and vanished, so that there was nothing but dry<br />
ground- parched by the spite of heaven. There were tall trees,<br />
moreover, that shed their fruit over his head- pears, pomegranates,<br />
apples, sweet figs and juicy olives, but whenever the poor creature<br />
stretched out his hand to take some, the wind tossed the branches back<br />
again to the clouds.<br />
&#8220;And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone<br />
with both his hands. With hands and feet he&#8217; tried to roll it up to<br />
the top of the hill, but always, just before he could roll it over<br />
on to the other side, its weight would be too much for him, and the<br />
pitiless stone would come thundering down again on to the plain.<br />
Then he would begin trying to push it up hill again, and the sweat ran<br />
off him and the steam rose after him.<br />
&#8220;After him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, for<br />
he is feasting ever with the immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe to<br />
wife, who is daughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaming<br />
round him like scared birds flying all whithers. He looked black as<br />
night with his bare bow in his hands and his arrow on the string,<br />
glaring around as though ever on the point of taking aim. About his<br />
breast there was a wondrous golden belt adorned in the most marvellous<br />
fashion with bears, wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes; there<br />
was also war, battle, and death. The man who made that belt, do what<br />
he might, would never be able to make another like it. Hercules knew<br />
me at once when he saw me, and spoke piteously, saying, my poor<br />
Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, are you too leading the same sorry kind<br />
of life that I did when I was above ground? I was son of Jove, but I<br />
went through an infinity of suffering, for I became bondsman to one<br />
who was far beneath me- a low fellow who set me all manner of labours.<br />
He once sent me here to fetch the hell-hound- for he did not think<br />
he could find anything harder for me than this, but I got the hound<br />
out of Hades and brought him to him, for Mercury and Minerva helped<br />
me.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;On this Hercules went down again into the house of Hades, but I<br />
stayed where I was in case some other of the mighty dead should come<br />
to me. And I should have seen still other of them that are gone<br />
before, whom I would fain have seen- Theseus and Pirithous glorious<br />
children of the gods, but so many thousands of ghosts came round me<br />
and uttered such appalling cries, that I was panic stricken lest<br />
Proserpine should send up from the house of Hades the head of that<br />
awful monster Gorgon. On this I hastened back to my ship and ordered<br />
my men to go on board at once and loose the hawsers; so they<br />
embarked and took their places, whereon the ship went down the<br />
stream of the river Oceanus. We had to row at first, but presently a<br />
fair wind sprang up.</p>
<p>
BOOK XII</p>
<p>&#8220;AFTER we were clear of the river Oceanus, and had got out into<br />
the open sea, we went on till we reached the Aeaean island where there<br />
is dawn and sunrise as in other places. We then drew our ship on to<br />
the sands and got out of her on to the shore, where we went to sleep<br />
and waited till day should break.<br />
&#8220;Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I<br />
sent some men to Circe&#8217;s house to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut<br />
firewood from a wood where the headland jutted out into the sea, and<br />
after we had wept over him and lamented him we performed his funeral<br />
rites. When his body and armour had been burned to ashes, we raised<br />
a cairn, set a stone over it, and at the top of the cairn we fixed the<br />
oar that he had been used to row with.<br />
&#8220;While we were doing all this, Circe, who knew that we had got<br />
back from the house of Hades, dressed herself and came to us as fast<br />
as she could; and her maid servants came with her bringing us bread,<br />
meat, and wine. Then she stood in the midst of us and said, &#8216;You<br />
have done a bold thing in going down alive to the house of Hades,<br />
and you will have died twice, to other people&#8217;s once; now, then,<br />
stay here for the rest of the day, feast your fill, and go on with<br />
your voyage at daybreak tomorrow morning. In the meantime I will<br />
tell Ulysses about your course, and will explain everything to him<br />
so as to prevent your suffering from misadventure either by land or<br />
sea.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;We agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelong<br />
day to the going down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it came<br />
on dark, the men laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables<br />
of the ship. Then Circe took me by the hand and bade me be seated away<br />
from the others, while she reclined by my side and asked me all<br />
about our adventures.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;So far so good,&#8217; said she, when I had ended my story, &#8216;and now pay<br />
attention to what I am about to tell you- heaven itself, indeed,<br />
will recall it to your recollection. First you will come to the Sirens<br />
who enchant all who come near them. If any one unwarily draws in too<br />
close and hears the singing of the Sirens, his wife and children<br />
will never welcome him home again, for they sit in a green field and<br />
warble him to death with the sweetness of their song. There is a great<br />
heap of dead men&#8217;s bones lying all around, with the flesh still<br />
rotting off them. Therefore pass these Sirens by, and stop your<br />
men&#8217;s ears with wax that none of them may hear; but if you like you<br />
can listen yourself, for you may get the men to bind you as you<br />
stand upright on a cross-piece half way up the mast, and they must<br />
lash the rope&#8217;s ends to the mast itself, that you may have the<br />
pleasure of listening. If you beg and pray the men to unloose you,<br />
then they must bind you faster.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you<br />
coherent directions as to which of two courses you are to take; I will<br />
lay the two alternatives before you, and you must consider them for<br />
yourself. On the one hand there are some overhanging rocks against<br />
which the deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat with terrific fury; the<br />
blessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not even a bird<br />
may pass, no, not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to Father<br />
Jove, but the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father<br />
Jove has to send another to make up their number; no ship that ever<br />
yet came to these rocks has got away again, but the waves and<br />
whirlwinds of fire are freighted with wreckage and with the bodies<br />
of dead men. The only vessel that ever sailed and got through, was the<br />
famous Argo on her way from the house of Aetes, and she too would have<br />
gone against these great rocks, only that Juno piloted her past them<br />
for the love she bore to Jason.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost<br />
in a dark cloud. This never leaves it, so that the top is never<br />
clear not even in summer and early autumn. No man though he had twenty<br />
hands and twenty feet could get a foothold on it and climb it, for<br />
it runs sheer up, as smooth as though it had been polished. In the<br />
middle of it there is a large cavern, looking West and turned<br />
towards Erebus; you must take your ship this way, but the cave is so<br />
high up that not even the stoutest archer could send an arrow into it.<br />
Inside it Scylla sits and yelps with a voice that you might take to be<br />
that of a young hound, but in truth she is a dreadful monster and no<br />
one- not even a god- could face her without being terror-struck. She<br />
has twelve mis-shapen feet, and six necks of the most prodigious<br />
length; and at the end of each neck she has a frightful head with<br />
three rows of teeth in each, all set very close together, so that they<br />
would crunch any one to death in a moment, and she sits deep within<br />
her shady cell thrusting out her heads and peering all round the rock,<br />
fishing for dolphins or dogfish or any larger monster that she can<br />
catch, of the thousands with which Amphitrite teems. No ship ever<br />
yet got past her without losing some men, for she shoots out all her<br />
heads at once, and carries off a man in each mouth.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;You will find the other rocks lie lower, but they are so close<br />
together that there is not more than a bowshot between them. [A<br />
large fig tree in full leaf grows upon it], and under it lies the<br />
sucking whirlpool of Charybdis. Three times in the day does she<br />
vomit forth her waters, and three times she sucks them down again; see<br />
that you be not there when she is sucking, for if you are, Neptune<br />
himself could not save you; you must hug the Scylla side and drive<br />
ship by as fast as you can, for you had better lose six men than<br />
your whole crew.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Is there no way,&#8217; said I, &#8216;of escaping Charybdis, and at the<br />
same time keeping Scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;You dare-devil,&#8217; replied the goddess, you are always wanting to<br />
fight somebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten<br />
even by the immortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is<br />
savage, extreme, rude, cruel and invincible. There is no help for<br />
it; your best chance will be to get by her as fast as ever you can,<br />
for if you dawdle about her rock while you are putting on your armour,<br />
she may catch you with a second cast of her six heads, and snap up<br />
another half dozen of your men; so drive your ship past her at full<br />
speed, and roar out lustily to Crataiis who is Scylla&#8217;s dam, bad<br />
luck to her; she will then stop her from making a second raid upon<br />
you.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;You will now come to the Thrinacian island, and here you will<br />
see many herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god-<br />
seven herds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in<br />
each flock. They do not breed, nor do they become fewer in number, and<br />
they are tended by the goddesses Phaethusa and Lampetie, who are<br />
children of the sun-god Hyperion by Neaera. Their mother when she<br />
had borne them and had done suckling them sent them to the<br />
Thrinacian island, which was a long way off, to live there and look<br />
after their father&#8217;s flocks and herds. If you leave these flocks<br />
unharmed, and think of nothing but getting home, you may yet after<br />
much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm them, then I forewarn<br />
you of the destruction both of your ship and of your comrades; and<br />
even though you may yourself escape, you will return late, in bad<br />
plight, after losing all your men.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven,<br />
whereon she returned inland. I then went on board and told my men to<br />
loose the ship from her moorings; so they at once got into her, took<br />
their places, and began to smite the grey sea with their oars.<br />
Presently the great and cunning goddess Circe befriended us with a<br />
fair wind that blew dead aft, and stayed steadily with us, keeping our<br />
sails well filled, so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship&#8217;s gear,<br />
and let her go as wind and helmsman headed her.<br />
&#8220;Then, being much troubled in mind, I said to my men, &#8216;My friends,<br />
it is not right that one or two of us alone should know the prophecies<br />
that Circe has made me, I will therefore tell you about them, so<br />
that whether we live or die we may do so with our eyes open. First she<br />
said we were to keep clear of the Sirens, who sit and sing most<br />
beautifully in a field of flowers; but she said I might hear them<br />
myself so long as no one else did. Therefore, take me and bind me to<br />
the crosspiece half way up the mast; bind me as I stand upright,<br />
with a bond so fast that I cannot possibly break away, and lash the<br />
rope&#8217;s ends to the mast itself. If I beg and pray you to set me<br />
free, then bind me more tightly still.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;I had hardly finished telling everything to the men before we<br />
reached the island of the two Sirens, for the wind had been very<br />
favourable. Then all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a<br />
breath of wind nor a ripple upon the water, so the men furled the<br />
sails and stowed them; then taking to their oars they whitened the<br />
water with the foam they raised in rowing. Meanwhile I look a large<br />
wheel of wax and cut it up small with my sword. Then I kneaded the wax<br />
in my strong hands till it became soft, which it soon did between<br />
the kneading and the rays of the sun-god son of Hyperion. Then I<br />
stopped the ears of all my men, and they bound me hands and feet to<br />
the mast as I stood upright on the crosspiece; but they went on rowing<br />
themselves. When we had got within earshot of the land, and the ship<br />
was going at a good rate, the Sirens saw that we were getting in shore<br />
and began with their singing.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Come here,&#8217; they sang, &#8216;renowned Ulysses, honour to the Achaean<br />
name, and listen to our two voices. No one ever sailed past us without<br />
staying to hear the enchanting sweetness of our song- and he who<br />
listens will go on his way not only charmed, but wiser, for we know<br />
all the ills that the gods laid upon the Argives and Trojans before<br />
Troy, and can tell you everything that is going to happen over the<br />
whole world.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;They sang these words most musically, and as I longed to hear<br />
them further I made by frowning to my men that they should set me<br />
free; but they quickened their stroke, and Eurylochus and Perimedes<br />
bound me with still stronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of<br />
the Sirens&#8217; voices. Then my men took the wax from their ears and<br />
unbound me.<br />
&#8220;Immediately after we had got past the island I saw a great wave<br />
from which spray was rising, and I heard a loud roaring sound. The men<br />
were so frightened that they loosed hold of their oars, for the<br />
whole sea resounded with the rushing of the waters, but the ship<br />
stayed where it was, for the men had left off rowing. I went round,<br />
therefore, and exhorted them man by man not to lose heart.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;My friends,&#8217; said I, &#8216;this is not the first time that we have been<br />
in danger, and we are in nothing like so bad a case as when the<br />
Cyclops shut us up in his cave; nevertheless, my courage and wise<br />
counsel saved us then, and we shall live to look back on all this as<br />
well. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say, trust in Jove and row on<br />
with might and main. As for you, coxswain, these are your orders;<br />
attend to them, for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away from<br />
these steaming rapids and hug the rock, or she will give you the<br />
slip and be over yonder before you know where you are, and you will be<br />
the death of us.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;So they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful<br />
monster Scylla, for I knew the men would not on rowing if I did, but<br />
would huddle together in the hold. In one thing only did I disobey<br />
Circe&#8217;s strict instructions- I put on my armour. Then seizing two<br />
strong spears I took my stand on the ship Is bows, for it was there<br />
that I expected first to see the monster of the rock, who was to do my<br />
men so much harm; but I could not make her out anywhere, though I<br />
strained my eyes with looking the gloomy rock all over and over<br />
&#8220;Then we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the one<br />
hand was Scylla, and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up<br />
the salt water. As she vomited it up, it was like the water in a<br />
cauldron when it is boiling over upon a great fire, and the spray<br />
reached the top of the rocks on either side. When she began to suck<br />
again, we could see the water all inside whirling round and round, and<br />
it made a deafening sound as it broke against the rocks. We could<br />
see the bottom of the whirlpool all black with sand and mud, and the<br />
men were at their wit&#8217;s ends for fear. While we were taken up with<br />
this, and were expecting each moment to be our last, Scylla pounced<br />
down suddenly upon us and snatched up my six best men. I was looking<br />
at once after both ship and men, and in a moment I saw their hands and<br />
feet ever so high above me, struggling in the air as Scylla was<br />
carrying them off, and I heard them call out my name in one last<br />
despairing cry. As a fisherman, seated, spear in hand, upon some<br />
jutting rock throws bait into the water to deceive the poor little<br />
fishes, and spears them with the ox&#8217;s horn with which his spear is<br />
shod, throwing them gasping on to the land as he catches them one by<br />
one- even so did Scylla land these panting creatures on her rock and<br />
munch them up at the mouth of her den, while they screamed and<br />
stretched out their hands to me in their mortal agony. This was the<br />
most sickening sight that I saw throughout all my voyages.<br />
&#8220;When we had passed the [Wandering] rocks, with Scylla and<br />
terrible Charybdis, we reached the noble island of the sun-god,<br />
where were the goodly cattle and sheep belonging to the sun<br />
Hyperion. While still at sea in my ship I could bear the cattle lowing<br />
as they came home to the yards, and the sheep bleating. Then I<br />
remembered what the blind Theban prophet Teiresias had told me, and<br />
how carefully Aeaean Circe had warned me to shun the island of the<br />
blessed sun-god. So being much troubled I said to the men, &#8216;My men,<br />
I know you are hard pressed, but listen while I tell you the<br />
prophecy that Teiresias made me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe warned<br />
me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god, for it was here, she<br />
said, that our worst danger would lie. Head the ship, therefore,<br />
away from the island.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;The men were in despair at this, and Eurylochus at once gave me<br />
an insolent answer. &#8216;Ulysses,&#8217; said he, &#8216;you are cruel; you are very<br />
strong yourself and never get worn out; you seem to be made of iron,<br />
and now, though your men are exhausted with toil and want of sleep,<br />
you will not let them land and cook themselves a good supper upon this<br />
island, but bid them put out to sea and go faring fruitlessly on<br />
through the watches of the flying night. It is by night that the winds<br />
blow hardest and do so much damage; how can we escape should one of<br />
those sudden squalls spring up from South West or West, which so often<br />
wreck a vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious? Now,<br />
therefore, let us obey the of night and prepare our supper here hard<br />
by the ship; to-morrow morning we will go on board again and put out<br />
to sea.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw that<br />
heaven meant us a mischief and said, &#8216;You force me to yield, for you<br />
are many against one, but at any rate each one of you must take his<br />
solemn oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock<br />
of sheep, he will not be so mad as to kill a single head of either,<br />
but will be satisfied with the food that Circe has given us.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their<br />
oath we made the ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of<br />
fresh water, and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers. As soon<br />
as they had had enough to eat and drink, they began talking about<br />
their poor comrades whom Scylla had snatched up and eaten; this set<br />
them weeping and they went on crying till they fell off into a sound<br />
sleep.<br />
&#8220;In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their<br />
places, Jove raised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane so that<br />
land and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night sprang forth<br />
out of the heavens. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,<br />
appeared, we brought the ship to land and drew her into a cave wherein<br />
the sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and I called the men<br />
together in council.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;My friends,&#8217; said I, &#8216;we have meat and drink in the ship, let us<br />
mind, therefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for<br />
it; for these cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who sees<br />
and gives ear to everything. And again they promised that they would<br />
obey.<br />
&#8220;For a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, and<br />
there was no other wind, but only South and East. As long as corn<br />
and wine held out the men did not touch the cattle when they were<br />
hungry; when, however, they had eaten all there was in the ship,<br />
they were forced to go further afield, with hook and line, catching<br />
birds, and taking whatever they could lay their hands on; for they<br />
were starving. One day, therefore, I went up inland that I might<br />
pray heaven to show me some means of getting away. When I had gone far<br />
enough to be clear of all my men, and had found a place that was<br />
well sheltered from the wind, I washed my hands and prayed to all<br />
the gods in Olympus till by and by they sent me off into a sweet<br />
sleep.<br />
&#8220;Meanwhile Eurylochus had been giving evil counsel to the men,<br />
&#8216;Listen to me,&#8217; said he, &#8216;my poor comrades. All deaths are bad<br />
enough but there is none so bad as famine. Why should not we drive<br />
in the best of these cows and offer them in sacrifice to the<br />
immortal Rods? If we ever get back to Ithaca, we can build a fine<br />
temple to the sun-god and enrich it with every kind of ornament; if,<br />
however, he is determined to sink our ship out of revenge for these<br />
homed cattle, and the other gods are of the same mind, I for one would<br />
rather drink salt water once for all and have done with it, than be<br />
starved to death by inches in such a desert island as this is.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. Now the<br />
cattle, so fair and goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; the<br />
men, therefore drove in the best of them, and they all stood round<br />
them saying their prayers, and using young oak-shoots instead of<br />
barley-meal, for there was no barley left. When they had done<br />
praying they killed the cows and dressed their carcasses; they cut out<br />
the thigh bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set some<br />
pieces of raw meat on top of them. They had no wine with which to make<br />
drink-offerings over the sacrifice while it was cooking, so they<br />
kept pouring on a little water from time to time while the inward<br />
meats were being grilled; then, when the thigh bones were burned and<br />
they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small and put<br />
the pieces upon the spits.<br />
&#8220;By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back to the<br />
ship and to the sea shore. As I drew near I began to smell hot roast<br />
meat, so I groaned out a prayer to the immortal gods. &#8216;Father Jove,&#8217; I<br />
exclaimed, &#8216;and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss,<br />
you have done me a cruel mischief by the sleep into which you have<br />
sent me; see what fine work these men of mine have been making in my<br />
absence.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we had<br />
been killing his cows, whereon he flew into a great rage, and said<br />
to the immortals, &#8216;Father Jove, and all you other gods who live in<br />
everlasting bliss, I must have vengeance on the crew of Ulysses&#8217; ship:<br />
they have had the insolence to kill my cows, which were the one<br />
thing I loved to look upon, whether I was going up heaven or down<br />
again. If they do not square accounts with me about my cows, I will go<br />
down to Hades and shine there among the dead.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Sun,&#8217; said Jove, &#8216;go on shining upon us gods and upon mankind over<br />
the fruitful earth. I will shiver their ship into little pieces with a<br />
bolt of white lightning as soon as they get out to sea.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;I was told all this by Calypso, who said she had heard it from<br />
the mouth of Mercury.<br />
&#8220;As soon as I got down to my ship and to the sea shore I rebuked<br />
each one of the men separately, but we could see no way out of it, for<br />
the cows were dead already. And indeed the gods began at once to<br />
show signs and wonders among us, for the hides of the cattle crawled<br />
about, and the joints upon the spits began to low like cows, and the<br />
meat, whether cooked or raw, kept on making a noise just as cows do.<br />
&#8220;For six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting upon<br />
them, but when Jove the son of Saturn had added a seventh day, the<br />
fury of the gale abated; we therefore went on board, raised our masts,<br />
spread sail, and put out to sea. As soon as we were well away from the<br />
island, and could see nothing but sky and sea, the son of Saturn<br />
raised a black cloud over our ship, and the sea grew dark beneath<br />
it. We not get on much further, for in another moment we were caught<br />
by a terrific squall from the West that snapped the forestays of the<br />
mast so that it fell aft, while all the ship&#8217;s gear tumbled about at<br />
the bottom of the vessel. The mast fell upon the head of the<br />
helmsman in the ship&#8217;s stern, so that the bones of his head were<br />
crushed to pieces, and he fell overboard as though he were diving,<br />
with no more life left in him.<br />
&#8220;Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts, and the ship went round<br />
and round, and was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightning<br />
struck it. The men all fell into the sea; they were carried about in<br />
the water round the ship, looking like so many sea-gulls, but the<br />
god presently deprived them of all chance of getting home again.<br />
&#8220;I stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel<br />
(which drifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her in<br />
the direction of the keel; but there was a backstay of stout<br />
ox-thong still hanging about it, and with this I lashed the mast and<br />
keel together, and getting astride of them was carried wherever the<br />
winds chose to take me.<br />
&#8220;[The gale from the West had now spent its force, and the wind got<br />
into the South again, which frightened me lest I should be taken<br />
back to the terrible whirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was what<br />
actually happened, for I was borne along by the waves all night, and<br />
by sunrise had reacfied the rock of Scylla, and the whirlpool. She was<br />
then sucking down the salt sea water, but I was carried aloft toward<br />
the fig tree, which I caught hold of and clung on to like a bat. I<br />
could not plant my feet anywhere so as to stand securely, for the<br />
roots were a long way off and the boughs that overshadowed the whole<br />
pool were too high, too vast, and too far apart for me to reach<br />
them; so I hung patiently on, waiting till the pool should discharge<br />
my mast and raft again- and a very long while it seemed. A juryman<br />
is not more glad to get home to supper, after having been long<br />
detained in court by troublesome cases, than I was to see my raft<br />
beginning to work its way out of the whirlpool again. At last I let go<br />
with my hands and feet, and fell heavily into the sea, bard by my raft<br />
on to which I then got, and began to row with my hands. As for Scylla,<br />
the father of gods and men would not let her get further sight of<br />
me- otherwise I should have certainly been lost.]<br />
&#8220;Hence I was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night the<br />
gods stranded me on the Ogygian island, where dwells the great and<br />
powerful goddess Calypso. She took me in and was kind to me, but I<br />
need say no more about this, for I told you and your noble wife all<br />
about it yesterday, and I hate saying the same thing over and over<br />
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>
BOOK XIII</p>
<p>THUS did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout the<br />
covered cloister, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presently<br />
Alcinous began to speak.<br />
&#8220;Ulysses,&#8221; said he, &#8220;now that you have reached my house I doubt<br />
not you will get home without further misadventure no matter how<br />
much you have suffered in the past. To you others, however, who come<br />
here night after night to drink my choicest wine and listen to my<br />
bard, I would insist as follows. Our guest has already packed up the<br />
clothes, wrought gold, and other valuables which you have brought<br />
for his acceptance; let us now, therefore, present him further, each<br />
one of us, with a large tripod and a cauldron. We will recoup<br />
ourselves by the levy of a general rate; for private individuals<br />
cannot be expected to bear the burden of such a handsome present.&#8221;<br />
Every one approved of this, and then they went home to bed each in<br />
his own abode. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,<br />
appeared, they hurried down to the ship and brought their cauldrons<br />
with them. Alcinous went on board and saw everything so securely<br />
stowed under the ship&#8217;s benches that nothing could break adrift and<br />
injure the rowers. Then they went to the house of Alcinous to get<br />
dinner, and he sacrificed a bull for them in honour of Jove who is the<br />
lord of all. They set the steaks to grill and made an excellent<br />
dinner, after which the inspired bard, Demodocus, who was a<br />
favourite with every one, sang to them; but Ulysses kept on turning<br />
his eyes towards the sun, as though to hasten his setting, for he<br />
was longing to be on his way. As one who has been all day ploughing<br />
a fallow field with a couple of oxen keeps thinking about his supper<br />
and is glad when night comes that he may go and get it, for it is<br />
all his legs can do to carry him, even so did Ulysses rejoice when the<br />
sun went down, and he at once said to the Phaecians, addressing<br />
himself more particularly to King Alcinous:<br />
&#8220;Sir, and all of you, farewell. Make your drink-offerings and send<br />
me on my way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart&#8217;s desire by<br />
giving me an escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that I<br />
may turn to good account; may I find my admirable wife living in peace<br />
among friends, and may you whom I leave behind me give satisfaction to<br />
your wives and children; may heaven vouchsafe you every good grace,<br />
and may no evil thing come among your people.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying and<br />
agreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken<br />
reasonably. Alcinous therefore said to his servant, &#8220;Pontonous, mix<br />
some wine and hand it round to everybody, that we may offer a prayer<br />
to father Jove, and speed our guest upon his way.&#8221;<br />
Pontonous mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn; the<br />
others each from his own seat made a drink-offering to the blessed<br />
gods that live in heaven, but Ulysses rose and placed the double cup<br />
in the hands of queen Arete.<br />
&#8220;Farewell, queen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;henceforward and for ever, till age and<br />
death, the common lot of mankind, lay their hands upon you. I now take<br />
my leave; be happy in this house with your children, your people,<br />
and with king Alcinous.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alcinous sent a man to<br />
conduct him to his ship and to the sea shore. Arete also sent some<br />
maid servants with him- one with a clean shirt and cloak, another to<br />
carry his strong-box, and a third with corn and wine. When they got to<br />
the water side the crew took these things and put them on board,<br />
with all the meat and drink; but for Ulysses they spread a rug and a<br />
linen sheet on deck that he might sleep soundly in the stern of the<br />
ship. Then he too went on board and lay down without a word, but the<br />
crew took every man his place and loosed the hawser from the pierced<br />
stone to which it had been bound. Thereon, when they began rowing<br />
out to sea, Ulysses fell into a deep, sweet, and almost deathlike<br />
slumber.<br />
The ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot<br />
flies over the course when the horses feel the whip. Her prow curveted<br />
as it were the neck of a stallion, and a great wave of dark blue water<br />
seethed in her wake. She held steadily on her course, and even a<br />
falcon, swiftest of all birds, could not have kept pace with her.<br />
Thus, then, she cut her way through the water. carrying one who was as<br />
cunning as the gods, but who was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful of<br />
all that he had suffered both on the field of battle and by the<br />
waves of the weary sea.<br />
When the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to<br />
show. the ship drew near to land. Now there is in Ithaca a haven of<br />
the old merman Phorcys, which lies between two points that break the<br />
line of the sea and shut the harbour in. These shelter it from the<br />
storms of wind and sea that rage outside, so that, when once within<br />
it, a ship may lie without being even moored. At the head of this<br />
harbour there is a large olive tree, and at no distance a fine<br />
overarching cavern sacred to the nymphs who are called Naiads. There<br />
are mixing-bowls within it and wine-jars of stone, and the bees hive<br />
there. Moreover, there are great looms of stone on which the nymphs<br />
weave their robes of sea purple- very curious to see- and at all times<br />
there is water within it. It has two entrances, one facing North by<br />
which mortals can go down into the cave, while the other comes from<br />
the South and is more mysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in by<br />
it, it is the way taken by the gods.<br />
Into this harbour, then, they took their ship, for they knew the<br />
place, She had so much way upon her that she ran half her own length<br />
on to the shore; when, however, they had landed, the first thing<br />
they did was to lift Ulysses with his rug and linen sheet out of the<br />
ship, and lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep. Then they took<br />
out the presents which Minerva had persuaded the Phaeacians to give<br />
him when he was setting out on his voyage homewards. They put these<br />
all together by the root of the olive tree, away from the road, for<br />
fear some passer by might come and steal them before Ulysses awoke;<br />
and then they made the best of their way home again.<br />
But Neptune did not forget the threats with which he had already<br />
threatened Ulysses, so he took counsel with Jove. &#8220;Father Jove,&#8221;<br />
said he, &#8220;I shall no longer be held in any sort of respect among you<br />
gods, if mortals like the Phaeacians, who are my own flesh and<br />
blood, show such small regard for me. I said I would Ulysses get<br />
home when he had suffered sufficiently. I did not say that he should<br />
never get home at all, for I knew you had already nodded your head<br />
about it, and promised that he should do so; but now they have brought<br />
him in a ship fast asleep and have landed him in Ithaca after<br />
loading him with more magnificent presents of bronze, gold, and<br />
raiment than he would ever have brought back from Troy, if he had<br />
had his share of the spoil and got home without misadventure.&#8221;<br />
And Jove answered, &#8220;What, O Lord of the Earthquake, are you<br />
talking about? The gods are by no means wanting in respect for you. It<br />
would be monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured as<br />
you are. As regards mortals, however, if any of them is indulging in<br />
insolence and treating you disrespectfully, it will always rest with<br />
yourself to deal with him as you may think proper, so do just as you<br />
please.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I should have done so at once,&#8221; replied Neptune, &#8220;if I were not<br />
anxious to avoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore,<br />
I should like to wreck the Phaecian ship as it is returning from its<br />
escort. This will stop them from escorting people in future; and I<br />
should also like to bury their city under a huge mountain.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My good friend,&#8221; answered Jove, &#8220;I should recommend you at the very<br />
moment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her way,<br />
to turn it into a rock near the land and looking like a ship. This<br />
will astonish everybody, and you can then bury their city under the<br />
mountain.&#8221;<br />
When earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria where<br />
the Phaecians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making<br />
rapid way, had got close-in. Then he went up to it, turned it into<br />
stone, and drove it down with the flat of his hand so as to root it in<br />
the ground. After this he went away.<br />
The Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would<br />
turn towards his neighbour, saying, &#8220;Bless my heart, who is it that<br />
can have rooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port?<br />
We could see the whole of her only moment ago.&#8221;<br />
This was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and<br />
Alcinous said, &#8220;I remember now the old prophecy of my father. He<br />
said that Neptune would be angry with us for taking every one so<br />
safely over the sea, and would one day wreck a Phaeacian ship as it<br />
was returning from an escort, and bury our city under a high mountain.<br />
This was what my old father used to say, and now it is all coming<br />
true. Now therefore let us all do as I say; in the first place we must<br />
leave off giving people escorts when they come here, and in the next<br />
let us sacrifice twelve picked bulls to Neptune that he may have mercy<br />
upon us, and not bury our city under the high mountain.&#8221; When the<br />
people heard this they were afraid and got ready the bulls.<br />
Thus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaecians to king Neptune,<br />
standing round his altar; and at the same time Ulysses woke up once<br />
more upon his own soil. He had been so long away that he did not<br />
know it again; moreover, Jove&#8217;s daughter Minerva had made it a foggy<br />
day, so that people might not know of his having come, and that she<br />
might tell him everything without either his wife or his fellow<br />
citizens and friends recognizing him until he had taken his revenge<br />
upon the wicked suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different<br />
to him- the long straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, and<br />
the goodly trees, appeared all changed as he started up and looked<br />
upon his native land. So he smote his thighs with the flat of his<br />
hands and cried aloud despairingly.<br />
&#8220;Alas,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;among what manner of people am I fallen?<br />
Are they savage and uncivilized or hospitable and humane? Where<br />
shall I put all this treasure, and which way shall I go? I wish I<br />
had stayed over there with the Phaeacians; or I could have gone to<br />
some other great chief who would have been good to me and given me<br />
an escort. As it is I do not know where to put my treasure, and I<br />
cannot leave it here for fear somebody else should get hold of it.<br />
In good truth the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians have not been<br />
dealing fairly by me, and have left me in the wrong country; they said<br />
they would take me back to Ithaca and they have not done so: may<br />
Jove the protector of suppliants chastise them, for he watches over<br />
everybody and punishes those who do wrong. Still, I suppose I must<br />
count my goods and see if the crew have gone off with any of them.&#8221;<br />
He counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his<br />
clothes, but there was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about<br />
not being in his own country, and wandered up and down by the shore of<br />
the sounding sea bewailing his hard fate. Then Minerva came up to<br />
him disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien,<br />
with a good cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals<br />
on her comely feet and held a javelin in her hand. Ulysses was glad<br />
when he saw her, and went straight up to her.<br />
&#8220;My friend,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you are the first person whom I have met with<br />
in this country; I salute you, therefore, and beg you to be will<br />
disposed towards me. Protect these my goods, and myself too, for I<br />
embrace your knees and pray to you as though you were a god. Tell<br />
me, then, and tell me truly, what land and country is this? Who are<br />
its inhabitants? Am I on an island, or is this the sea board of some<br />
continent?&#8221;<br />
Minerva answered, &#8220;Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have<br />
come from somewhere a long way off, not to know what country this<br />
is. It is a very celebrated place, and everybody knows it East and<br />
West. It is rugged and not a good driving country, but it is by no<br />
means a bid island for what there is of it. It grows any quantity of<br />
corn and also wine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; it<br />
breeds cattle also and goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and there<br />
are watering places where the water never runs dry; so, sir, the<br />
name of Ithaca is known even as far as Troy, which I understand to<br />
be a long way off from this Achaean country.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his own<br />
country, and he began to answer, but he did not speak the truth, and<br />
made up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.<br />
&#8220;I heard of Ithaca,&#8221; said he, &#8220;when I was in Crete beyond the<br />
seas, and now it seems I have reached it with all these treasures. I<br />
have left as much more behind me for my children, but am flying<br />
because I killed Orsilochus son of Idomeneus, the fleetest runner in<br />
Crete. I killed him because he wanted to rob me of the spoils I had<br />
got from Troy with so much trouble and danger both on the field of<br />
battle and by the waves of the weary sea; he said I had not served his<br />
father loyally at Troy as vassal, but had set myself up as an<br />
independent ruler, so I lay in wait for him and with one of my<br />
followers by the road side, and speared him as he was coming into town<br />
from the country. my It was a very dark night and nobody saw us; it<br />
was not known, therefore, that I had killed him, but as soon as I<br />
had done so I went to a ship and besought the owners, who were<br />
Phoenicians, to take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Elis<br />
where the Epeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them.<br />
They meant no guile, but the wind drove them off their course, and<br />
we sailed on till we came hither by night. It was all we could do to<br />
get inside the harbour, and none of us said a word about supper though<br />
we wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay down just as we<br />
were. I was very tired and fell asleep directly, so they took my goods<br />
out of the ship, and placed them beside me where I was lying upon<br />
the sand. Then they sailed away to Sidonia, and I was left here in<br />
great distress of mind.&#8221;<br />
Such was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her<br />
hand. Then she took the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise,<br />
&#8220;He must be indeed a shifty lying fellow,&#8221; said she, &#8220;who could<br />
surpass you in all manner of craft even though you had a god for<br />
your antagonist. Dare-devil that you are, full of guile, unwearying in<br />
deceit, can you not drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood,<br />
even now that you are in your own country again? We will say no<br />
more, however, about this, for we can both of us deceive upon<br />
occasion- you are the most accomplished counsellor and orator among<br />
all mankind, while I for diplomacy and subtlety have no equal among<br />
the gods. Did you not know Jove&#8217;s daughter Minerva- me, who have<br />
been ever with you, who kept watch over you in all your troubles,<br />
and who made the Phaeacians take so great a liking to you? And now,<br />
again, I am come here to talk things over with you, and help you to<br />
hide the treasure I made the Phaeacians give you; I want to tell you<br />
about the troubles that await you in your own house; you have got to<br />
face them, but tell no one, neither man nor woman, that you have<br />
come home again. Bear everything, and put up with every man&#8217;s<br />
insolence, without a word.&#8221;<br />
And Ulysses answered, &#8220;A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but<br />
you are so constantly changing your appearance that when he meets<br />
you it is a hard matter for him to know whether it is you or not. This<br />
much, however, I know exceedingly well; you were very kind to me as<br />
long as we Achaeans were fighting before Troy, but from the day on<br />
which we went on board ship after having sacked the city of Priam, and<br />
heaven dispersed us- from that day, Minerva, I saw no more of you, and<br />
cannot ever remember your coming to my ship to help me in a<br />
difficulty; I had to wander on sick and sorry till the gods<br />
delivered me from evil and I reached the city of the Phaeacians, where<br />
you encouraged me and took me into the town. And now, I beseech you in<br />
your father&#8217;s name, tell me the truth, for I do not believe I am<br />
really back in Ithaca. I am in some other country and you are<br />
mocking me and deceiving me in all you have been saying. Tell me<br />
then truly, have I really got back to my own country?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You are always taking something of that sort into your head,&#8221;<br />
replied Minerva, &#8220;and that is why I cannot desert you in your<br />
afflictions; you are so plausible, shrewd and shifty. Any one but<br />
yourself on returning from so long a voyage would at once have gone<br />
home to see his wife and children, but you do not seem to care about<br />
asking after them or hearing any news about them till you have<br />
exploited your wife, who remains at home vainly grieving for you,<br />
and having no peace night or day for the tears she sheds on your<br />
behalf. As for my not coming near you, I was never uneasy about you,<br />
for I was certain you would get back safely though you would lose<br />
all your men, and I did not wish to quarrel with my uncle Neptune, who<br />
never forgave you for having blinded his son. I will now, however,<br />
point out to you the lie of the land, and you will then perhaps<br />
believe me. This is the haven of the old merman Phorcys, and here is<br />
the olive tree that grows at the head of it; [near it is the cave<br />
sacred to the Naiads;] here too is the overarching cavern in which you<br />
have offered many an acceptable hecatomb to the nymphs, and this is<br />
the wooded mountain Neritum.&#8221;<br />
As she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared.<br />
Then Ulysses rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, and<br />
kissed the bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the<br />
nymphs, saying, &#8220;Naiad nymphs, daughters of Jove, I made sure that I<br />
was never again to see you, now therefore I greet you with all<br />
loving salutations, and I will bring you offerings as in the old days,<br />
if Jove&#8217;s redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my son to<br />
manhood.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Take heart, and do not trouble yourself about that,&#8221; rejoined<br />
Minerva, &#8220;let us rather set about stowing your things at once in the<br />
cave, where they will be quite safe. Let us see how we can best manage<br />
it all.&#8221;<br />
Therewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest<br />
hiding places, while Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold,<br />
bronze, and good clothing which the Phaecians had given him. They<br />
stowed everything carefully away, and Minerva set a stone against<br />
the door of the cave. Then the two sat down by the root of the great<br />
olive, and consulted how to compass the destruction of the wicked<br />
suitors.<br />
&#8220;Ulysses,&#8221; said Minerva, &#8220;noble son of Laertes, think how you can<br />
lay hands on these disreputable people who have been lording it in<br />
your house these three years, courting your wife and making wedding<br />
presents to her, while she does nothing but lament your absence,<br />
giving hope and sending your encouraging messages to every one of<br />
them, but meaning the very opposite of all she says&#8217;<br />
And Ulysses answered, &#8220;In good truth, goddess, it seems I should<br />
have come to much the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did,<br />
if you had not given me such timely information. Advise me how I shall<br />
best avenge myself. Stand by my side and put your courage into my<br />
heart as on the day when we loosed Troy&#8217;s fair diadem from her brow.<br />
Help me now as you did then, and I will fight three hundred men, if<br />
you, goddess, will be with me.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Trust me for that,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I will not lose sight of you when<br />
once we set about it, and I would imagine that some of those who are<br />
devouring your substance will then bespatter the pavement with their<br />
blood and brains. I will begin by disguising you so that no human<br />
being shall know you; I will cover your body with wrinkles; you<br />
shall lose all your yellow hair; I will clothe you in a garment that<br />
shall fill all who see it with loathing; I will blear your fine eyes<br />
for you, and make you an unseemly object in the sight of the<br />
suitors, of your wife, and of the son whom you left behind you. Then<br />
go at once to the swineherd who is in charge of your pigs; he has been<br />
always well affected towards you, and is devoted to Penelope and<br />
your son; you will find him feeding his pigs near the rock that is<br />
called Raven by the fountain Arethusa, where they are fattening on<br />
beechmast and spring water after their manner. Stay with him and<br />
find out how things are going, while I proceed to Sparta and see<br />
your son, who is with Menelaus at Lacedaemon, where he has gone to try<br />
and find out whether you are still alive.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;But why,&#8221; said Ulysses, &#8220;did you not tell him, for you knew all<br />
about it? Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of<br />
hardship while others are eating up his estate?&#8221;<br />
Minerva answered, &#8220;Never mind about him, I sent him that he might be<br />
well spoken of for having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty, but is<br />
staying quite comfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded with<br />
abundance of every kind. The suitors have put out to sea and are lying<br />
in wait for him, for they mean to kill him before he can get home. I<br />
do not much think they will succeed, but rather that some of those who<br />
are now eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves.&#8221;<br />
As she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him<br />
with wrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh<br />
over his whole body; she bleared his eyes, which were naturally very<br />
fine ones; she changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap<br />
about him, and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke; she<br />
also gave him an undressed deer skin as an outer garment, and<br />
furnished him with a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a twisted<br />
thong for him to sling it over his shoulder.<br />
When the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddess<br />
went straight to Lacedaemon to fetch Telemachus.</p>
<p>
BOOK XIV</p>
<p>ULYSSES now left the haven, and took the rough track up through<br />
the wooded country and over the crest of the mountain till he<br />
reached the place where Minerva had said that he would find the<br />
swineherd, who was the most thrifty servant he had. He found him<br />
sitting in front of his hut, which was by the yards that he had<br />
built on a site which could be seen from far. He had made them<br />
spacious and fair to see, with a free ran for the pigs all round them;<br />
he had built them during his master&#8217;s absence, of stones which he<br />
had gathered out of the ground, without saying anything to Penelope or<br />
Laertes, and he had fenced them on top with thorn bushes. Outside<br />
the yard he had run a strong fence of oaken posts, split, and set<br />
pretty close together, while inside lie had built twelve sties near<br />
one another for the sows to lie in. There were fifty pigs wallowing in<br />
each sty, all of them breeding sows; but the boars slept outside and<br />
were much fewer in number, for the suitors kept on eating them, and<br />
die swineherd had to send them the best he had continually. There were<br />
three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the herdsman&#8217;s four hounds,<br />
which were as fierce as wolves, slept always with them. The<br />
swineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of sandals from a good<br />
stout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding the pigs in one place<br />
or another, and he had sent the fourth to town with a boar that he had<br />
been forced to send the suitors that they might sacrifice it and<br />
have their fill of meat.<br />
When the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew<br />
at him, but Ulysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose his<br />
hold of the stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have been<br />
torn by them in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox<br />
hide, rushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the<br />
dogs off by shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said to<br />
Ulysses, &#8220;Old man, the dogs were likely to have made short work of<br />
you, and then you would have got me into trouble. The gods have<br />
given me quite enough worries without that, for I have lost the best<br />
of masters, and am in continual grief on his account. I have to attend<br />
swine for other people to eat, while he, if he yet lives to see the<br />
light of day, is starving in some distant land. But come inside, and<br />
when you have had your fill of bread and wine, tell me where you<br />
come from, and all about your misfortunes.&#8221;<br />
On this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit<br />
down. He strewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the<br />
top of this he threw the shaggy chamois skin- a great thick one- on<br />
which he used to sleep by night. Ulysses was pleased at being made<br />
thus welcome, and said &#8220;May Jove, sir, and the rest of the gods<br />
grant you your heart&#8217;s desire in return for the kind way in which<br />
you have received me.&#8221;<br />
To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, &#8220;Stranger, though a still<br />
poorer man should come here, it would not be right for me to insult<br />
him, for all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take what<br />
you can get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when they<br />
have young lords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for<br />
heaven has hindered the return of him who would have been always<br />
good to me and given me something of my own- a house, a piece of land,<br />
a good looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows a<br />
servant who has worked hard for him, and whose labour the gods have<br />
prospered as they have mine in the situation which I hold. If my<br />
master had grown old here he would have done great things by me, but<br />
he is gone, and I wish that Helen&#8217;s whole race were utterly destroyed,<br />
for she has been the death of many a good man. It was this matter that<br />
took my master to Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight the<br />
Trojans in the cause of kin Agamemnon.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the sties<br />
where the young sucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which he<br />
brought back with him and sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and<br />
spitted on them; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set<br />
it before Ulysses, hot and still on the spit, whereon Ulysses<br />
sprinkled it over with white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed<br />
wine in a bowl of ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told<br />
him to begin.<br />
&#8220;Fall to, stranger,&#8221; said he, &#8220;on a dish of servant&#8217;s pork. The<br />
fat pigs have to go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame or<br />
scruple; but the blessed gods love not such shameful doings, and<br />
respect those who do what is lawful and right. Even the fierce<br />
free-booters who go raiding on other people&#8217;s land, and Jove gives<br />
them their spoil- even they, when they have filled their ships and got<br />
home again live conscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement;<br />
but some god seems to have told these people that Ulysses is dead<br />
and gone; they will not, therefore, go back to their own homes and<br />
make their offers of marriage in the usual way, but waste his estate<br />
by force, without fear or stint. Not a day or night comes out of<br />
heaven, but they sacrifice not one victim nor two only, and they<br />
take the run of his wine, for he was exceedingly rich. No other<br />
great man either in Ithaca or on the mainland is as rich as he was; he<br />
had as much as twenty men put together. I will tell you what he had.<br />
There are twelve herds of cattle upon the mainland, and as many flocks<br />
of sheep, there are also twelve droves of pigs, while his own men<br />
and hired strangers feed him twelve widely spreading herds of goats.<br />
Here in Ithaca he runs even large flocks of goats on the far end of<br />
the island, and they are in the charge of excellent goatherds. Each<br />
one of these sends the suitors the best goat in the flock every day.<br />
As for myself, I am in charge of the pigs that you see here, and I<br />
have to keep picking out the best I have and sending it to them.&#8221;<br />
This was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking<br />
ravenously without a word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten<br />
enough and was satisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which he<br />
usually drank, filled it with wine, and gave it to Ulysses, who was<br />
pleased, and said as he took it in his hands, &#8220;My friend, who was this<br />
master of yours that bought you and paid for you, so rich and so<br />
powerful as you tell me? You say he perished in the cause of King<br />
Agamemnon; tell me who he was, in case I may have met with such a<br />
person. Jove and the other gods know, but I may be able to give you<br />
news of him, for I have travelled much.&#8221;<br />
Eumaeus answered, &#8220;Old man, no traveller who comes here with news<br />
will get Ulysses&#8217; wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless,<br />
tramps in want of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of<br />
lies, and not a word of truth; every one who finds his way to Ithaca<br />
goes to my mistress and tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them<br />
in, makes much of them, and asks them all manner of questions,<br />
crying all the time as women will when they have lost their<br />
husbands. And you too, old man, for a shirt and a cloak would<br />
doubtless make up a very pretty story. But the wolves and birds of<br />
prey have long since torn Ulysses to pieces, or the fishes of the<br />
sea have eaten him, and his bones are lying buried deep in sand upon<br />
some foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and a bad business it is<br />
for all his friends- for me especially; go where I may I shall never<br />
find so good a master, not even if I were to go home to my mother<br />
and father where I was bred and born. I do not so much care,<br />
however, about my parents now, though I should dearly like to see them<br />
again in my own country; it is the loss of Ulysses that grieves me<br />
most; I cannot speak of him without reverence though he is here no<br />
longer, for he was very fond of me, and took such care of me that<br />
whereever he may be I shall always honour his memory.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My friend,&#8221; replied Ulysses, &#8220;you are very positive, and very<br />
hard of belief about your master&#8217;s coming home again, nevertheless I<br />
will not merely say, but will swear, that he is coming. Do not give me<br />
anything for my news till he has actually come, you may then give me a<br />
shirt and cloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want, but I<br />
will not take anything at all till then, for I hate a man, even as I<br />
hate hell fire, who lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I swear<br />
by king Jove, by the rites of hospitality, and by that hearth of<br />
Ulysses to which I have now come, that all will surely happen as I<br />
have said it will. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with<br />
the end of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here<br />
to do vengeance on all those who are ill treating his wife and son.&#8221;<br />
To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, &#8220;Old man, you will<br />
neither get paid for bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come<br />
home; drink you wine in peace, and let us talk about something else.<br />
Do not keep on reminding me of all this; it always pains me when any<br />
one speaks about my honoured master. As for your oath we will let it<br />
alone, but I only wish he may come, as do Penelope, his old father<br />
Laertes, and his son Telemachus. I am terribly unhappy too about<br />
this same boy of his; he was running up fast into manhood, and bade<br />
fare to be no worse man, face and figure, than his father, but some<br />
one, either god or man, has been unsettling his mind, so he has gone<br />
off to Pylos to try and get news of his father, and the suitors are<br />
lying in wait for him as he is coming home, in the hope of leaving the<br />
house of Arceisius without a name in Ithaca. But let us say no more<br />
about him, and leave him to be taken, or else to escape if the son<br />
of Saturn holds his hand over him to protect him. And now, old man,<br />
tell me your own story; tell me also, for I want to know, who you<br />
are and where you come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what<br />
manner of ship you came in, how crew brought you to Ithaca, and from<br />
what country they professed to come- for you cannot have come by<br />
land.&#8221;<br />
And Ulysses answered, &#8220;I will tell you all about it. If there were<br />
meat and wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing<br />
to do but to eat and drink while the others go to their work, I<br />
could easily talk on for a whole twelve months without ever<br />
finishing the story of the sorrows with which it has pleased heaven to<br />
visit me.<br />
&#8220;I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well-to-do man, who had<br />
many sons born in marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he<br />
had purchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of<br />
Hylax (whose lineage I claim, and who was held in the highest honour<br />
among the Cretans for his wealth, prosperity, and the valour of his<br />
sons) put me on the same level with my brothers who had been born in<br />
wedlock. When, however, death took him to the house of Hades, his sons<br />
divided his estate and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gave<br />
a holding and little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me to marry<br />
into a rich family, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking on<br />
the field of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the<br />
straw you can see what the ear was, for I have had trouble enough<br />
and to spare. Mars and Minerva made me doughty in war; when I had<br />
picked my men to surprise the enemy with an ambuscade I never gave<br />
death so much as a thought, but was the first to leap forward and<br />
spear all whom I could overtake. Such was I in battle, but I did not<br />
care about farm work, nor the frugal home life of those who would<br />
bring up children. My delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and<br />
arrows- things that most men shudder to think of; but one man likes<br />
one thing and another another, and this was what I was most<br />
naturally inclined to. Before the Achaeans went to Troy, nine times<br />
was I in command of men and ships on foreign service, and I amassed<br />
much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil in the first instance, and<br />
much more was allotted to me later on.<br />
&#8220;My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, but<br />
when Jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which so many<br />
perished, the people required me and Idomeneus to lead their ships<br />
to Troy, and there was no way out of it, for they insisted on our<br />
doing so. There we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth we<br />
sacked the city of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us.<br />
Then it was that Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one month<br />
happily with my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived the<br />
idea of making a descent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet and<br />
manned it. I had nine ships, and the people flocked to fill them.<br />
For six days I and my men made feast, and I found them many victims<br />
both for sacrifice to the gods and for themselves, but on the<br />
seventh day we went on board and set sail from Crete with a fair North<br />
wind behind us though we were going down a river. Nothing went ill<br />
with any of our ships, and we had no sickness on board, but sat<br />
where we were and let the ships go as the wind and steersmen took<br />
them. On the fifth day we reached the river Aegyptus; there I<br />
stationed my ships in the river, bidding my men stay by them and<br />
keep guard over them while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every<br />
point of vantage.<br />
&#8220;But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, and<br />
ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their<br />
wives and children captive. The alarm was soon carried to the city,<br />
and when they heard the war cry, the people came out at daybreak<br />
till the plain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the<br />
gleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would<br />
no longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The<br />
Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced<br />
labour for them. Jove, however, put it in my mind to do thus- and I<br />
wish I had died then and there in Egypt instead, for there was much<br />
sorrow in store for me- I took off my helmet and shield and dropped my<br />
spear from my hand; then I went straight up to the king&#8217;s chariot,<br />
clasped his knees and kissed them, whereon he spared my life, bade<br />
me get into his chariot, and took me weeping to his own home. Many<br />
made at me with their ashen spears and tried to kil me in their<br />
fury, but the king protected me, for he feared the wrath of Jove the<br />
protector of strangers, who punishes those who do evil.<br />
&#8220;I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among<br />
the Egyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now<br />
going on for eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning<br />
rascal, who had already committed all sorts of villainy, and this<br />
man talked me over into going with him to Phoenicia, where his house<br />
and his possessions lay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months, but<br />
at the end of that time when months and days had gone by till the same<br />
season had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound for<br />
Libya, on a pretence that I was to take a cargo along with him to that<br />
place, but really that he might sell me as a slave and take the<br />
money I fetched. I suspected his intention, but went on board with<br />
him, for I could not help it.<br />
&#8220;The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the<br />
sea that lies between Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled<br />
their destruction, for as soon as we were well out from Crete and<br />
could see nothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over our<br />
ship and the sea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with his<br />
thunderbolts and the ship went round and round and was filled with<br />
fire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all into<br />
the sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship looking<br />
like so many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all<br />
chance of getting home again. I was all dismayed; Jove, however,<br />
sent the ship&#8217;s mast within my reach, which saved my life, for I clung<br />
to it, and drifted before the fury of the gale. Nine days did I<br />
drift but in the darkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me on<br />
to the Thesprotian coast. There Pheidon king of the Thesprotians<br />
entertained me hospitably without charging me anything at all for<br />
his son found me when I was nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon<br />
he raised me by the hand, took me to his father&#8217;s house and gave me<br />
clothes to wear.<br />
&#8220;There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me<br />
he had entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on<br />
his homeward journey. He showed me also the treasure of gold, and<br />
wrought iron that Ulysses had got together. There was enough to keep<br />
his family for ten generations, so much had he left in the house of<br />
king Pheidon. But the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he<br />
might learn Jove&#8217;s mind from the god&#8217;s high oak tree, and know whether<br />
after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly, or in<br />
secret. Moreover the king swore in my presence, making drink-offerings<br />
in his own house as he did so, that the ship was by the water side,<br />
and the crew found, that should take him to his own country. He sent<br />
me off however before Ulysses returned, for there happened to be a<br />
Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium,<br />
and he told those in charge of her to be sure and take me safely to<br />
King Acastus.<br />
&#8220;These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to<br />
the very extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out<br />
from land they resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me<br />
of the shirt and cloak that I was wearing, and gave me instead the<br />
tattered old clouts in which you now see me; then, towards<br />
nightfall, they reached the tilled lands of Ithaca, and there they<br />
bound me with a strong rope fast in the ship, while they went on shore<br />
to get supper by the sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds for<br />
me, and having drawn my rags over my head I slid down the rudder<br />
into the sea, where I struck out and swam till I was well clear of<br />
them, and came ashore near a thick wood in which I lay concealed. They<br />
were very angry at my having escaped and went searching about for<br />
me, till at last they thought it was no further use and went back to<br />
their ship. The gods, having hidden me thus easily, then took me to<br />
a good man&#8217;s door- for it seems that I am not to die yet awhile.&#8221;<br />
To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, &#8220;Poor unhappy stranger, I<br />
have found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, but<br />
that part about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me to<br />
believe it. Why should a man like you go about telling lies in this<br />
way? I know all about the return of my master. The gods one and all of<br />
them detest him, or they would have taken him before Troy, or let<br />
him die with friends around him when the days of his fighting were<br />
done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes<br />
and his son would have been heir to his renown, but now the storm<br />
winds have spirited him away we know not whither.<br />
&#8220;As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go to<br />
the town unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news<br />
about Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions, both those<br />
who grieve over the king&#8217;s absence, and those who rejoice at it<br />
because they can eat up his property without paying for it. For my own<br />
part I have never cared about asking anyone else since the time when I<br />
was taken in by an Aetolian, who had killed a man and come a long<br />
way till at last he reached my station, and I was very kind to him. He<br />
said he had seen Ulysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting<br />
his ships which had been damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses would<br />
return in the following summer or autumn with his men, and that he<br />
would bring back much wealth. And now you, you unfortunate old man,<br />
since fate has brought you to my door, do not try to flatter me in<br />
this way with vain hopes. It is not for any such reason that I shall<br />
treat you kindly, but only out of respect for Jove the god of<br />
hospitality, as fearing him and pitying you.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses answered, &#8220;I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have<br />
given you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make<br />
a bargain, and call all the gods in heaven to witness it. If your<br />
master comes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send me<br />
to Dulichium where I want to go; but if he does not come as I say he<br />
will, set your men on to me, and tell them to throw me from yonder<br />
precepice, as a warning to tramps not to go about the country<br />
telling lies.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;And a pretty figure I should cut then,&#8221; replied Eumaeus, both now<br />
and hereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut<br />
and showing you hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good<br />
earnest if I did; but it is just supper time and I hope my men will<br />
come in directly, that we may cook something savoury for supper.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with<br />
the pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their sties, and<br />
a tremendous squealing they made as they were being driven into<br />
them. But Eumaeus called to his men and said, &#8220;Bring in the best pig<br />
you have, that I may sacrifice for this stranger, and we will take<br />
toll of him ourselves. We have had trouble enough this long time<br />
feeding pigs, while others reap the fruit of our labour.&#8221;<br />
On this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a<br />
fine fat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus<br />
did not forget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, so the<br />
first thing he did was to cut bristles from the pig&#8217;s face and throw<br />
them into the fire, praying to all the gods as he did so that<br />
Ulysses might return home again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet<br />
of oak which he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood, and<br />
stunned it, while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they<br />
cut it up, and Eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each joint<br />
on to some of the fat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid<br />
upon the embers; they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the<br />
pieces upon the spits and roasted them till they were done; when<br />
they had taken them off the spits they threw them on to the dresser in<br />
a heap. The swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then stood up<br />
to give every one his share. He made seven portions; one of these he<br />
set apart for Mercury the son of Maia and the nymphs, praying to<br />
them as he did so; the others he dealt out to the men man by man. He<br />
gave Ulysses some slices cut lengthways down the loin as a mark of<br />
especial honour, and Ulysses was much pleased. &#8220;I hope, Eumaeus,&#8221; said<br />
he, &#8220;that Jove will be as well disposed towards you as I am, for the<br />
respect you are showing to an outcast like myself.&#8221;<br />
To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, &#8220;Eat, my good fellow, and<br />
enjoy your supper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that,<br />
just as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he chooses.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt<br />
sacrifice to the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering,<br />
put the cup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down to his own<br />
portion. Mesaulius brought them their bread; the swineherd had<br />
bought this man on his own account from among the Taphians during<br />
his master&#8217;s absence, and had paid for him with his own money<br />
without saying anything either to his mistress or Laertes. They then<br />
laid their hands upon the good things that were before them, and<br />
when they had had enough to eat and drink, Mesaulius took away what<br />
was left of the bread, and they all went to bed after having made a<br />
hearty supper.<br />
Now the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon.<br />
It poured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West,<br />
which is a wet quarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whether<br />
Eumaeus, in the excellent care he took of him, would take off his<br />
own cloak and give it him, or make one of his men give him one.<br />
&#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;Eumaeus and the rest of you; when I have<br />
said a prayer I will tell you something. It is the wine that makes<br />
me talk in this way; wine will make even a wise man fall to singing;<br />
it will make him chuckle and dance and say many a word that he had<br />
better leave unspoken; still, as I have begun, I will go on. Would<br />
that I were still young and strong as when we got up an ambuscade<br />
before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses were the leaders, but I was in<br />
command also, for the other two would have it so. When we had come<br />
up to the wall of the city we crouched down beneath our armour and lay<br />
there under cover of the reeds and thick brush-wood that grew about<br />
the swamp. It came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the snow<br />
fell small and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated thick<br />
with rime. The others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept<br />
comfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders, but I had<br />
carelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking that I should be<br />
too cold, and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and shield. When<br />
the night was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted their their<br />
places, I nudged Ulysses who was close to me with my elbow, and he<br />
at once gave me his ear.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Ulysses,&#8217; said I, &#8216;this cold will be the death of me, for I have<br />
no cloak; some god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but my<br />
shirt, and I do not know what to do.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the<br />
following plan:<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Keep still,&#8217; said he in a low voice, &#8216;or the others will hear<br />
you.&#8217; Then he raised his head on his elbow.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;My friends,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep.<br />
We are a long way from the ships; I wish some one would go down and<br />
tell Agamemnon to send us up more men at once.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out<br />
running to the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it<br />
comfortably enough till morning. Would that I were still young and<br />
strong as I was in those days, for then some one of you swineherds<br />
would give me a cloak both out of good will and for the respect due to<br />
a brave soldier; but now people look down upon me because my clothes<br />
are shabby.&#8221;<br />
And Eumaeus answered, &#8220;Old man, you have told us an excellent story,<br />
and have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the<br />
present, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything<br />
else that a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but<br />
to-morrow morning you have to shake your own old rags about your<br />
body again, for we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here,<br />
but every man has only one. When Ulysses&#8217; son comes home again he will<br />
give you both cloak and shirt, and send you wherever you may want to<br />
go.&#8221;<br />
With this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some<br />
goatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here<br />
Ulysses lay down, and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy<br />
cloak that he kept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad<br />
weather.<br />
Thus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But<br />
the swineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he got<br />
ready to go and Ulysses was glad to see that he looked after his<br />
property during his master&#8217;s absence. First he slung his sword over<br />
his brawny shoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. He<br />
also took the skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case<br />
of attack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his rest where<br />
the pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter<br />
from the North wind.</p>
<p>
BOOK XV</p>
<p>BUT Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Ulysses&#8217; son<br />
that he was to return at once. She found him and Pisistratus<br />
sleeping in the forecourt of Menelaus&#8217;s house; Pisistratus was fast<br />
asleep, but Telemachus could get no rest all night for thinking of his<br />
unhappy father, so Minerva went close up to him and said:<br />
&#8220;Telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer,<br />
nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they<br />
will eat up everything you have among them, and you will have been<br />
on a fool&#8217;s errand. Ask Menelaus to send you home at once if you<br />
wish to find your excellent mother still there when you get back.<br />
Her father and brothers are already urging her to marry Eurymachus,<br />
who has given her more than any of the others, and has been greatly<br />
increasing his wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have been<br />
taken from the house in spite of you, but you know what women are-<br />
they always want to do the best they can for the man who marries them,<br />
and never give another thought to the children of their first husband,<br />
nor to their father either when he is dead and done with. Go home,<br />
therefore, and put everything in charge of the most respectable<br />
woman servant that you have, until it shall please heaven to send<br />
you a wife of your own. Let me tell you also of another matter which<br />
you had better attend to. The chief men among the suitors are lying in<br />
wait for you in the Strait between Ithaca and Samos, and they mean<br />
to kill you before you can reach home. I do not much think they will<br />
succeed; it is more likely that some of those who are now eating up<br />
your property will find a grave themselves. Sail night and day, and<br />
keep your ship well away from the islands; the god who watches over<br />
you and protects you will send you a fair wind. As soon as you get<br />
to Ithaca send your ship and men on to the town, but yourself go<br />
straight to the swineherd who has charge your pigs; he is well<br />
disposed towards you, stay with him, therefore, for the night, and<br />
then send him to Penelope to tell her that you have got back safe from<br />
Pylos.&#8221;<br />
Then she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus<br />
with his heel to rouse him, and said, &#8220;Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke<br />
the horses to the chariot, for we must set off home.&#8221;<br />
But Pisistratus said, &#8220;No matter what hurry we are in we cannot<br />
drive in the dark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has<br />
brought his presents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him<br />
say good-bye to us in the usual way. So long as he lives a guest<br />
should never forget a host who has shown him kindness.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen,<br />
leaving Helen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he<br />
put on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over his<br />
shoulders, and went out to meet him. &#8220;Menelaus,&#8221; said he, &#8220;let me go<br />
back now to my own country, for I want to get home.&#8221;<br />
And Menelaus answered, &#8220;Telemachus, if you insist on going I will<br />
not detain you. not like to see a host either too fond of his guest or<br />
too rude to him. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a<br />
man go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if he<br />
would like to stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he is<br />
in the house and speed him when he wants to leave it. Wait, then, till<br />
I can get your beautiful presents into your chariot, and till you have<br />
yourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a sufficient<br />
dinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once<br />
more proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting<br />
out on such a long journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for<br />
making a tour in Hellas or in the Peloponnese, I will yoke my<br />
horses, and will conduct you myself through all our principal<br />
cities. No one will send us away empty handed; every one will give<br />
us something- a bronze tripod, a couple of mules, or a gold cup.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Menelaus,&#8221; replied Telemachus, &#8220;I want to go home at once, for when<br />
I came away I left my property without protection, and fear that while<br />
looking for my father I shall come to ruin myself, or find that<br />
something valuable has been stolen during my absence.&#8221;<br />
When Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants<br />
to prepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in the<br />
house. At this moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and<br />
had just got up; so Menelaus told him to light the fire and cook<br />
some meat, which he at once did. Then Menelaus went down into his<br />
fragrant store room, not alone, but Helen went too, with<br />
Megapenthes. When he reached the place where the treasures of his<br />
house were kept, he selected a double cup, and told his son<br />
Megapenthes to bring also a silver mixing-bowl. Meanwhile Helen went<br />
to the chest where she kept the lovely dresses which she had made with<br />
her own hands, and took out one that was largest and most<br />
beautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered like a star, and<br />
lay at the very bottom of the chest. Then they all came back through<br />
the house again till they got to Telemachus, and Menelaus said,<br />
&#8220;Telemachus, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno, bring you safely<br />
home according to your desire. I will now present you with the<br />
finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a<br />
mixing-bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold,<br />
and it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians made<br />
me a present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while I<br />
was on my return home. I should like to give it to you.&#8221;<br />
With these words he placed the double cup in the hands of<br />
Telemachus, while Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing-bowl and<br />
set it before him. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in<br />
her hand.<br />
&#8220;I too, my son,&#8221; said she, &#8220;have something for you as a keepsake<br />
from the hand of Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her<br />
wedding day. Till then, get your dear mother to keep it for you;<br />
thus may you go back rejoicing to your own country and to your home.&#8221;<br />
So saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly.<br />
Then Pisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired them<br />
all as he did so. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus<br />
into the house, and they both of them sat down to table. A maid<br />
servant brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it<br />
into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean<br />
table beside them; an upper servant brought them bread and offered<br />
them many good things of what there was in the house. Eteoneus<br />
carved the meat and gave them each their portions, while Megapenthes<br />
poured out the wine. Then they laid their hands upon the good things<br />
that were before them, but as soon as they had had had enough to eat<br />
and drink Telemachus and Pisistratus yoked the horses, and took<br />
their places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner<br />
gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court, and<br />
Menelaus came after them with a golden goblet of wine in his right<br />
hand that they might make a drink-offering before they set out. He<br />
stood in front of the horses and pledged them, saying, &#8220;Farewell to<br />
both of you; see that you tell Nestor how I have treated you, for he<br />
was as kind to me as any father could be while we Achaeans were<br />
fighting before Troy.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;We will be sure, sir,&#8221; answered Telemachus, &#8220;to tell him everything<br />
as soon as we see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses<br />
returned when I get back to Ithaca, that I might tell him of the<br />
very great kindness you have shown me and of the many beautiful<br />
presents I am taking with me.&#8221;<br />
As he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand- an eagle with<br />
a great white goose in its talons which it had carried off from the<br />
farm yard- and all the men and women were running after it and<br />
shouting. It came quite close up to them and flew away on their<br />
right hands in front of the horses. When they saw it they were glad,<br />
and their hearts took comfort within them, whereon Pisistratus said,<br />
&#8220;Tell me, Menelaus, has heaven sent this omen for us or for you?&#8221;<br />
Menelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him<br />
to make, but Helen was too quick for him and said, &#8220;I will read this<br />
matter as heaven has put it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it<br />
will come to pass. The eagle came from the mountain where it was<br />
bred and has its nest, and in like manner Ulysses, after having<br />
travelled far and suffered much, will return to take his revenge- if<br />
indeed he is not back already and hatching mischief for the suitors.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;May Jove so grant it,&#8221; replied Telemachus; &#8220;if it should prove to<br />
be so, I will make vows to you as though you were a god, even when I<br />
am at home.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full<br />
speed through the town towards the open country. They swayed the<br />
yoke upon their necks and travelled the whole day long till the sun<br />
set and darkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae,<br />
where Diocles lived who was son of Ortilochus, the son of Alpheus.<br />
There they passed the night and were treated hospitably. When the<br />
child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their<br />
horses and their places in the chariot. They drove out through the<br />
inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Then<br />
Pisistratus lashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing<br />
loath; ere long they came to Pylos, and then Telemachus said:<br />
&#8220;Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask<br />
you. You know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we are<br />
both of an age, and this journey has brought us together still more<br />
closely; do not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave me<br />
there, for if I go to your father&#8217;s house he will try to keep me in<br />
the warmth of his good will towards me, and I must go home at once.&#8221;<br />
Pisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the end<br />
he deemed it best to turn his horses towards the ship, and put<br />
Menelaus&#8217;s beautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern of<br />
the vessel. Then he said, &#8220;Go on board at once and tell your men to do<br />
so also before I can reach home to tell my father. I know how<br />
obstinate he is, and am sure he will not let you go; he will come down<br />
here to fetch you, and he will not go back without you. But he will be<br />
very angry.&#8221;<br />
With this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians<br />
and soon reached his home, but Telemachus called the men together<br />
and gave his orders. &#8220;Now, my men,&#8221; said he, &#8220;get everything in<br />
order on board the ship, and let us set out home.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But<br />
as Telemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minerva<br />
in the ship&#8217;s stern, there came to him a man from a distant country, a<br />
seer, who was flying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was<br />
descended from Melampus, who used to live in Pylos, the land of sheep;<br />
he was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven into exile by<br />
the great and powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized his goods and held<br />
them for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner in the<br />
house of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on account<br />
of the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great sorrow<br />
that dread Erinyes had laid upon him. In the end, however, he<br />
escaped with his life, drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos, avenged<br />
the wrong that had been done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus to<br />
his brother. Then he left the country and went to Argos, where it<br />
was ordained that he should reign over much people. There he<br />
married, established himself, and had two famous sons Antiphates and<br />
Mantius. Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of<br />
Amphiaraus, who was dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he<br />
did not live to old age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a<br />
woman&#8217;s gifts. His sons were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, the<br />
other son of Melampus, was father to Polypheides and Cleitus.<br />
Aurora, throned in gold, carried off Cleitus for his beauty&#8217;s sake,<br />
that he might dwell among the immortals, but Apollo made Polypheides<br />
the greatest seer in the whole world now that Amphiaraus was dead.<br />
He quarrelled with his father and went to live in Hyperesia, where<br />
he remained and prophesied for all men.<br />
His son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as he<br />
was making drink-offerings and praying in his ship. &#8220;Friend&#8217;&#8221; said he,<br />
&#8220;now that I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by<br />
your sacrifices themselves, and by the god to whom you make them, I<br />
pray you also by your own head and by those of your followers, tell me<br />
the truth and nothing but the truth. Who and whence are you? Tell me<br />
also of your town and parents.&#8221;<br />
Telemachus said, &#8220;I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca,<br />
and my father is &#8216;Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he has<br />
come to some miserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got<br />
my crew together to see if I can hear any news of him, for he has been<br />
away a long time.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I too,&#8221; answered Theoclymenus, am an exile, for I have killed a man<br />
of my own race. He has many brothers and kinsmen in Argos, and they<br />
have great power among the Argives. I am flying to escape death at<br />
their hands, and am thus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of the<br />
earth. I am your suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your ship<br />
that they may not kill me, for I know they are in pursuit.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I will not refuse you,&#8221; replied Telemachus, &#8220;if you wish to join<br />
us. Come, therefore, and in Ithaca we will treat you hospitably<br />
according to what we have.&#8221;<br />
On this he received Theoclymenus&#8217; spear and laid it down on the deck<br />
of the ship. He went on board and sat in the stern, bidding<br />
Theoclymenus sit beside him; then the men let go the hawsers.<br />
Telemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes, and they made all<br />
haste to do so. They set the mast in its socket in the cross plank,<br />
raised it and made it fast with the forestays, and they hoisted<br />
their white sails with sheets of twisted ox hide. Minerva sent them<br />
a fair wind that blew fresh and strong to take the ship on her<br />
course as fast as possible. Thus then they passed by Crouni and<br />
Chalcis.<br />
Presently the sun set and darkness was over all the land. The vessel<br />
made a quick pass sage to Pheae and thence on to Elis, where the<br />
Epeans rule. Telemachus then headed her for the flying islands,<br />
wondering within himself whether he should escape death or should be<br />
taken prisoner.<br />
Meanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper in<br />
the hut, and the men supped with them. As soon as they had had to<br />
eat and drink, Ulysses began trying to prove the swineherd and see<br />
whether he would continue to treat him kindly, and ask him to stay<br />
on at the station or pack him off to the city; so he said:<br />
&#8220;Eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow I want to go away and begin<br />
begging about the town, so as to be no more trouble to you or to<br />
your men. Give me your advice therefore, and let me have a good<br />
guide to go with me and show me the way. I will go the round of the<br />
city begging as I needs must, to see if any one will give me a drink<br />
and a piece of bread. I should like also to go to the house of Ulysses<br />
and bring news of her husband to queen Penelope. I could then go about<br />
among the suitors and see if out of all their abundance they will give<br />
me a dinner. I should soon make them an excellent servant in all sorts<br />
of ways. Listen and believe when I tell you that by the blessing of<br />
Mercury who gives grace and good name to the works of all men, there<br />
is no one living who would make a more handy servant than I should- to<br />
put fresh wood on the fire, chop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine, and<br />
do all those services that poor men have to do for their betters.&#8221;<br />
The swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. &#8220;Heaven<br />
help me,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;what ever can have put such a notion as<br />
that into your head? If you go near the suitors you will be undone<br />
to a certainty, for their pride and insolence reach the very<br />
heavens. They would never think of taking a man like you for a<br />
servant. Their servants are all young men, well dressed, wearing<br />
good cloaks and shirts, with well looking faces and their hair<br />
always tidy, the tables are kept quite clean and are loaded with<br />
bread, meat, and wine. Stay where you are, then; you are not in<br />
anybody&#8217;s way; I do not mind your being here, no more do any of the<br />
others, and when Telemachus comes home he will give you a shirt and<br />
cloak and will send you wherever you want to go.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses answered, &#8220;I hope you may be as dear to the gods as you<br />
are to me, for having saved me from going about and getting into<br />
trouble; there is nothing worse than being always ways on the tramp;<br />
still, when men have once got low down in the world they will go<br />
through a great deal on behalf of their miserable bellies. Since<br />
however you press me to stay here and await the return of<br />
Telemachus, tell about Ulysses&#8217; mother, and his father whom he left on<br />
the threshold of old age when he set out for Troy. Are they still<br />
living or are they already dead and in the house of Hades?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I will tell you all about them,&#8221; replied Eumaeus, &#8220;Laertes is still<br />
living and prays heaven to let him depart peacefully his own house,<br />
for he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and also<br />
about the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged him<br />
more than anything else did. She came to an unhappy end through sorrow<br />
for her son: may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by me<br />
come to such an end as she did. As long as she was still living,<br />
though she was always grieving, I used to like seeing her and asking<br />
her how she did, for she brought me up along with her daughter<br />
Ctimene, the youngest of her children; we were boy and girl<br />
together, and she made little difference between us. When, however, we<br />
both grew up, they sent Ctimene to Same and received a splendid<br />
dowry for her. As for me, my mistress gave me a good shirt and cloak<br />
with a pair of sandals for my feet, and sent me off into the<br />
country, but she was just as fond of me as ever. This is all over now.<br />
Still it has pleased heaven to prosper my work in the situation<br />
which I now hold. I have enough to eat and drink, and can find<br />
something for any respectable stranger who comes here; but there is no<br />
getting a kind word or deed out of my mistress, for the house has<br />
fallen into the hands of wicked people. Servants want sometimes to see<br />
their mistress and have a talk with her; they like to have something<br />
to eat and drink at the house, and something too to take back with<br />
them into the country. This is what will keep servants in a good<br />
humour.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses answered, &#8220;Then you must have been a very little fellow,<br />
Eumaeus, when you were taken so far away from your home and parents.<br />
Tell me, and tell me true, was the city in which your father and<br />
mother lived sacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off<br />
when you were alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and<br />
sell you for whatever your master gave them?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Stranger,&#8221; replied Eumaeus, &#8220;as regards your question: sit still,<br />
make yourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen to me. The<br />
nights are now at their longest; there is plenty of time both for<br />
sleeping and sitting up talking together; you ought not to go to bed<br />
till bed time, too much sleep is as bad as too little; if any one of<br />
the others wishes to go to bed let him leave us and do so; he can then<br />
take my master&#8217;s pigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning.<br />
We two will sit here eating and drinking in the hut, and telling one<br />
another stories about our misfortunes; for when a man has suffered<br />
much, and been buffeted about in the world, he takes pleasure in<br />
recalling the memory of sorrows that have long gone by. As regards<br />
your question, then, my tale is as follows:<br />
&#8220;You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above<br />
Ortygia, where the land begins to turn round and look in another<br />
direction. It is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is good,<br />
with much pasture fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wine<br />
and wheat. Dearth never comes there, nor are the people plagued by any<br />
sickness, but when they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills<br />
them with his painless shafts. It contains two communities, and the<br />
whole country is divided between these two. My father Ctesius son of<br />
Ormenus, a man comparable to the gods, reigned over both.<br />
&#8220;Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia<br />
(for the Phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had<br />
freighted with gewgaws of all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician<br />
woman in my father&#8217;s house, very tall and comely, and an excellent<br />
servant; these scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washing<br />
near their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her in ways that no woman<br />
can resist, no matter how good she may be by nature. The man who had<br />
seduced her asked her who she was and where she came from, and on<br />
this she told him her father&#8217;s name. &#8216;I come from Sidon,&#8217; said she,<br />
&#8216;and am daughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. One day as I<br />
was coming into the town from the country some Taphian pirates<br />
seized me and took me here over the sea, where they sold me to the man<br />
who owns this house, and he gave them their price for me.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;The man who had seduced her then said, &#8216;Would you like to come<br />
along with us to see the house of your parents and your parents<br />
themselves? They are both alive and are said to be well off.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;I will do so gladly,&#8217; answered she, &#8216;if you men will first swear<br />
me a solemn oath that you will do me no harm by the way.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;They all swore as she told them, and when they had completed<br />
their oath the woman said, &#8216;Hush; and if any of your men meets me in<br />
the street or at the well, do not let him speak to me, for fear some<br />
one should go and tell my master, in which case he would suspect<br />
something. He would put me in prison, and would have all of you<br />
murdered; keep your own counsel therefore; buy your merchandise as<br />
fast as you can, and send me word when you have done loading. I will<br />
bring as much gold as I can lay my hands on, and there is something<br />
else also that I can do towards paying my fare. I am nurse to the<br />
son of the good man of the house, a funny little fellow just able to<br />
run about. I will carry him off in your ship, and you will get a great<br />
deal of money for him if you take him and sell him in foreign parts.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a<br />
whole year till they had loaded their ship with much precious<br />
merchandise, and then, when they had got freight enough, they sent<br />
to tell the woman. Their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came to<br />
my father&#8217;s house bringing a necklace of gold with amber beads<br />
strung among it; and while my mother and the servants had it in<br />
their hands admiring it and bargaining about it, he made a sign<br />
quietly to the woman and then went back to the ship, whereon she<br />
took me by the hand and led me out of the house. In the fore part of<br />
the house she saw the tables set with the cups of guests who had<br />
been feasting with my father, as being in attendance on him; these<br />
were now all gone to a meeting of the public assembly, so she snatched<br />
up three cups and carried them off in the bosom of her dress, while<br />
I followed her, for I knew no better. The sun was now set, and<br />
darkness was over all the land, so we hurried on as fast as we could<br />
till we reached the harbour, where the Phoenician ship was lying. When<br />
they had got on board they sailed their ways over the sea, taking us<br />
with them, and Jove sent then a fair wind; six days did we sail both<br />
night and day, but on the seventh day Diana struck the woman and she<br />
fell heavily down into the ship&#8217;s hold as though she were a sea gull<br />
alighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the seals and<br />
fishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the winds<br />
and waves took the ship to Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of his<br />
chattels for me, and thus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon<br />
this country.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses answered, &#8220;Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your<br />
misfortunes with the most lively interest and pity, but Jove has given<br />
you good as well as evil, for in spite of everything you have a good<br />
master, who sees that you always have enough to eat and drink; and you<br />
lead a good life, whereas I am still going about begging my way from<br />
city to city.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left<br />
for sleep, for it was soon daybreak. In the meantime Telemachus and<br />
his crew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails, took down the<br />
mast, and rowed the ship into the harbour. They cast out their mooring<br />
stones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea<br />
shore, mixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had had<br />
enough to eat and drink Telemachus said, &#8220;Take the ship on to the<br />
town, but leave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on<br />
one of my farms. In the evening, when I have seen all I want, I will<br />
come down to the city, and to-morrow morning in return for your<br />
trouble I will give you all a good dinner with meat and wine.&#8221;<br />
Then Theoclymenus said, &#8216;And what, my dear young friend, is to<br />
become of me? To whose house, among all your chief men, am I to<br />
repair? or shall I go straight to your own house and to your mother?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;At any other time,&#8221; replied Telemachus, &#8220;I should have bidden you<br />
go to my own house, for you would find no want of hospitality; at<br />
the present moment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for I<br />
shall be away, and my mother will not see you; she does not often show<br />
herself even to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in an<br />
upper chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a man whose<br />
house you can go to- I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, who is held<br />
in the highest estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much the<br />
best man and the most persistent wooer, of all those who are paying<br />
court to my mother and trying to take Ulysses&#8217; place. Jove, however,<br />
in heaven alone knows whether or no they will come to a bad end before<br />
the marriage takes place.&#8221;<br />
As he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand- a hawk,<br />
Apollo&#8217;s messenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as<br />
it tore them off, fell to the ground midway between Telemachus and the<br />
ship. On this Theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the<br />
hand. &#8220;Telemachus,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that bird did not fly on your right hand<br />
without having been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew<br />
it was an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that<br />
there will be no house in Ithaca more royal than your own.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I wish it may prove so,&#8221; answered Telemachus. &#8220;If it does, I will<br />
show you so much good will and give you so many presents that all<br />
who meet you will congratulate you.&#8221;<br />
Then he said to his friend Piraeus, &#8220;Piraeus, son of Clytius, you<br />
have throughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of all<br />
those who have accompanied me to Pylos; I wish you would take this<br />
stranger to your own house and entertain him hospitably till I can<br />
come for him.&#8221;<br />
And Piraeus answered, &#8220;Telemachus, you may stay away as long as<br />
you please, but I will look after him for you, and he shall find no<br />
lack of hospitality.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he went on board, and bade the others do so also and<br />
loose the hawsers, so they took their places in the ship. But<br />
Telemachus bound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear<br />
with a head of sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. Then they<br />
loosed the hawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towards<br />
the city as they had been told to do, while Telemachus strode on as<br />
fast as he could, till he reached the homestead where his countless<br />
herds of swine were feeding, and where dwelt the excellent<br />
swineherd, who was so devoted a servant to his master.</p>
