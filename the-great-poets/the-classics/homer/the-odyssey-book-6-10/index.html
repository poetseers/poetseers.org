				<p>BOOK VI</p>
<p>SO HERE Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva<br />
went off to the country and city of the Phaecians- a people who used<br />
to live in the fair town of Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now<br />
the Cyclopes were stronger than they and plundered them, so their king<br />
Nausithous moved them thence and settled them in Scheria, far from all<br />
other people. He surrounded the city with a wall, built houses and<br />
temples, and divided the lands among his people; but he was dead and<br />
gone to the house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels were<br />
inspired of heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, did<br />
Minerva hie in furtherance of the return of Ulysses.<br />
She went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which<br />
there slept a girl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa,<br />
daughter to King Alcinous. Two maid servants were sleeping near her,<br />
both very pretty, one on either side of the doorway, which was<br />
closed with well-made folding doors. Minerva took the form of the<br />
famous sea captain Dymas&#8217;s daughter, who was a bosom friend of<br />
Nausicaa and just her own age; then, coming up to the girl&#8217;s bedside<br />
like a breath of wind, she hovered over her head and said:<br />
&#8220;Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazy<br />
daughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are<br />
going to be married almost immediately, and should not only be well<br />
dressed yourself, but should find good clothes for those who attend<br />
you. This is the way to get yourself a good name, and to make your<br />
father and mother proud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow a<br />
washing day, and start at daybreak. I will come and help you so that<br />
you may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the best<br />
young men among your own people are courting you, and you are not<br />
going to remain a maid much longer. Ask your father, therefore, to<br />
have a waggon and mules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs,<br />
robes, and girdles; and you can ride, too, which will be much<br />
pleasanter for you than walking, for the washing-cisterns are some way<br />
from the town.&#8221;<br />
When she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus, which they<br />
say is the everlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly,<br />
and neither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting<br />
sunshine and in a great peacefulness of light, wherein the blessed<br />
gods are illumined for ever and ever. This was the place to which<br />
the goddess went when she had given instructions to the girl.<br />
By and by morning came and woke Nausicaa, who began wondering<br />
about her dream; she therefore went to the other end of the house to<br />
tell her father and mother all about it, and found them in their own<br />
room. Her mother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple<br />
yarn with her maids around her, and she happened to catch her father<br />
just as he was going out to attend a meeting of the town council,<br />
which the Phaeacian aldermen had convened. She stopped him and said:<br />
&#8220;Papa dear, could you manage to let me have a good big waggon? I<br />
want to take all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them. You are<br />
the chief man here, so it is only right that you should have a clean<br />
shirt when you attend meetings of the council. Moreover, you have five<br />
sons at home, two of them married, while the other three are<br />
good-looking bachelors; you know they always like to have clean<br />
linen when they go to a dance, and I have been thinking about all<br />
this.&#8221;<br />
She did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not like<br />
to, but her father knew and said, &#8220;You shall have the mules, my<br />
love, and whatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you, and<br />
the men shall get you a good strong waggon with a body to it that will<br />
hold all your clothes.&#8221;<br />
On this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the waggon<br />
out, harnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought<br />
the clothes down from the linen room and placed them on the waggon.<br />
Her mother prepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of<br />
good things, and a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got into the<br />
waggon, and her mother gave her also a golden cruse of oil, that she<br />
and her women might anoint themselves. Then she took the whip and<br />
reins and lashed the mules on, whereon they set off, and their hoofs<br />
clattered on the road. They pulled without flagging, and carried not<br />
only Nausicaa and her wash of clothes, but the maids also who were<br />
with her.<br />
When they reached the water side they went to the<br />
washing-cisterns, through which there ran at all times enough pure<br />
water to wash any quantity of linen, no matter how dirty. Here they<br />
unharnessed the mules and turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy<br />
herbage that grew by the water side. They took the clothes out of<br />
the waggon, put them in the water, and vied with one another in<br />
treading them in the pits to get the dirt out. After they had washed<br />
them and got them quite clean, they laid them out by the sea side,<br />
where the waves had raised a high beach of shingle, and set about<br />
washing themselves and anointing themselves with olive oil. Then<br />
they got their dinner by the side of the stream, and waited for the<br />
sun to finish drying the clothes. When they had done dinner they threw<br />
off the veils that covered their heads and began to play at ball,<br />
while Nausicaa sang for them. As the huntress Diana goes forth upon<br />
the mountains of Taygetus or Erymanthus to hunt wild boars or deer,<br />
and the wood-nymphs, daughters of Aegis-bearing Jove, take their sport<br />
along with her (then is Leto proud at seeing her daughter stand a full<br />
head taller than the others, and eclipse the loveliest amid a whole<br />
bevy of beauties), even so did the girl outshine her handmaids.<br />
When it was time for them to start home, and they were folding the<br />
clothes and putting them into the waggon, Minerva began to consider<br />
how Ulysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to<br />
conduct him to the city of the Phaeacians. The girl, therefore,<br />
threw a ball at one of the maids, which missed her and fell into<br />
deep water. On this they all shouted, and the noise they made woke<br />
Ulysses, who sat up in his bed of leaves and began to wonder what it<br />
might all be.<br />
&#8220;Alas,&#8221; said he to himself, &#8220;what kind of people have I come<br />
amongst? Are they cruel, savage, and uncivilized, or hospitable and<br />
humane? I seem to hear the voices of young women, and they sound<br />
like those of the nymphs that haunt mountain tops, or springs of<br />
rivers and meadows of green grass. At any rate I am among a race of<br />
men and women. Let me try if I cannot manage to get a look at them.&#8221;<br />
As he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off a<br />
bough covered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. He looked<br />
like some lion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his<br />
strength and defying both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowls<br />
in quest of oxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will dare<br />
break even into a well-fenced homestead, trying to get at the sheep-<br />
even such did Ulysses seem to the young women, as he drew near to them<br />
all naked as he was, for he was in great want. On seeing one so<br />
unkempt and so begrimed with salt water, the others scampered off<br />
along the spits that jutted out into the sea, but the daughter of<br />
Alcinous stood firm, for Minerva put courage into her heart and took<br />
away all fear from her. She stood right in front of Ulysses, and he<br />
doubted whether he should go up to her, throw himself at her feet, and<br />
embrace her knees as a suppliant, or stay where he was and entreat her<br />
to give him some clothes and show him the way to the town. In the<br />
end he deemed it best to entreat her from a distance in case the<br />
girl should take offence at his coming near enough to clasp her knees,<br />
so he addressed her in honeyed and persuasive language.<br />
&#8220;O queen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I implore your aid- but tell me, are you a<br />
goddess or are you a mortal woman? If you are a goddess and dwell in<br />
heaven, I can only conjecture that you are Jove&#8217;s daughter Diana,<br />
for your face and figure resemble none but hers; if on the other<br />
hand you are a mortal and live on earth, thrice happy are your<br />
father and mother- thrice happy, too, are your brothers and sisters;<br />
how proud and delighted they must feel when they see so fair a scion<br />
as yourself going out to a dance; most happy, however, of all will<br />
he be whose wedding gifts have been the richest, and who takes you<br />
to his own home. I never yet saw any one so beautiful, neither man nor<br />
woman, and am lost in admiration as I behold you. I can only compare<br />
you to a young palm tree which I saw when I was at Delos growing<br />
near the altar of Apollo- for I was there, too, with much people after<br />
me, when I was on that journey which has been the source of all my<br />
troubles. Never yet did such a young plant shoot out of the ground<br />
as that was, and I admired and wondered at it exactly as I now<br />
admire and wonder at yourself. I dare not clasp your knees, but I am<br />
in great distress; yesterday made the twentieth day that I had been<br />
tossing about upon the sea. The winds and waves have taken me all<br />
the way from the Ogygian island, and now fate has flung me upon this<br />
coast that I may endure still further suffering; for I do not think<br />
that I have yet come to the end of it, but rather that heaven has<br />
still much evil in store for me.<br />
&#8220;And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person I<br />
have met, and I know no one else in this country. Show me the way to<br />
your town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hither<br />
to wrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your<br />
heart&#8217;s desire- husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; for<br />
there is nothing better in this world than that man and wife should be<br />
of one mind in a house. It discomfits their enemies, makes the<br />
hearts of their friends glad, and they themselves know more about it<br />
than any one.&#8221;<br />
To this Nausicaa answered, &#8220;Stranger, you appear to be a sensible,<br />
well-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Jove gives<br />
prosperity to rich and poor just as he chooses, so you must take<br />
what he has seen fit to send you, and make the best of it. Now,<br />
however, that you have come to this our country, you shall not want<br />
for clothes nor for anything else that a foreigner in distress may<br />
reasonably look for. I will show you the way to the town, and will<br />
tell you the name of our people; we are called Phaeacians, and I am<br />
daughter to Alcinous, in whom the whole power of the state is vested.&#8221;<br />
Then she called her maids and said, &#8220;Stay where you are, you<br />
girls. Can you not see a man without running away from him? Do you<br />
take him for a robber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else can<br />
come here to do us Phaeacians any harm, for we are dear to the gods,<br />
and live apart on a land&#8217;s end that juts into the sounding sea, and<br />
have nothing to do with any other people. This is only some poor man<br />
who has lost his way, and we must be kind to him, for strangers and<br />
foreigners in distress are under Jove&#8217;s protection, and will take what<br />
they can get and be thankful; so, girls, give the poor fellow<br />
something to eat and drink, and wash him in the stream at some place<br />
that is sheltered from the wind.&#8221;<br />
On this the maids left off running away and began calling one<br />
another back. They made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa<br />
had told them, and brought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought<br />
him the little golden cruse of oil, and told him to go wash in the<br />
stream. But Ulysses said, &#8220;Young women, please to stand a little on<br />
one side that I may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself<br />
with oil, for it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of oil<br />
upon it. I cannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. I am<br />
ashamed to strip before a number of good-looking young women.&#8221;<br />
Then they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Ulysses<br />
washed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back<br />
and from his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself,<br />
and had got the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil,<br />
and put on the clothes which the girl had given him; Minerva then made<br />
him look taller and stronger than before, she also made the hair<br />
grow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like<br />
hyacinth blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders as a<br />
skilful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan and<br />
Minerva enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it- and his work<br />
is full of beauty. Then he went and sat down a little way off upon the<br />
beach, looking quite young and handsome, and the girl gazed on him<br />
with admiration; then she said to her maids:<br />
&#8220;Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods who<br />
live in heaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first<br />
saw him I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that of<br />
the gods who dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband to be<br />
just such another as he is, if he would only stay here and not want to<br />
go away. However, give him something to eat and drink.&#8221;<br />
They did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate and<br />
drank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind.<br />
Meanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen<br />
folded and placed in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she<br />
took her seat, she called Ulysses:<br />
&#8220;Stranger,&#8221; said she, &#8220;rise and let us be going back to the town;<br />
I will introduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I<br />
can tell you that you will meet all the best people among the<br />
Phaecians. But be sure and do as I bid you, for you seem to be a<br />
sensible person. As long as we are going past the fields- and farm<br />
lands, follow briskly behind the waggon along with the maids and I<br />
will lead the way myself. Presently, however, we shall come to the<br />
town, where you will find a high wall running all round it, and a good<br />
harbour on either side with a narrow entrance into the city, and the<br />
ships will be drawn up by the road side, for every one has a place<br />
where his own ship can lie. You will see the market place with a<br />
temple of Neptune in the middle of it, and paved with large stones<br />
bedded in the earth. Here people deal in ship&#8217;s gear of all kinds,<br />
such as cables and sails, and here, too, are the places where oars are<br />
made, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of archers; they know<br />
nothing about bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring folk, and pride<br />
themselves on their masts, oars, and ships, with which they travel far<br />
over the sea.<br />
&#8220;I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot<br />
against me later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, and<br />
some low fellow, if he met us, might say, &#8216;Who is this fine-looking<br />
stranger that is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she End him? I<br />
suppose she is going to marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor<br />
whom she has taken from some foreign vessel, for we have no<br />
neighbours; or some god has at last come down from heaven in answer to<br />
her prayers, and she is going to live with him all the rest of her<br />
life. It would be a good thing if she would take herself of I for sh<br />
and find a husband somewhere else, for she will not look at one of the<br />
many excellent young Phaeacians who are in with her.&#8217; This is the kind<br />
of disparaging remark that would be made about me, and I could not<br />
complain, for I should myself be scandalized at seeing any other<br />
girl do the like, and go about with men in spite of everybody, while<br />
her father and mother were still alive, and without having been<br />
married in the face of all the world.<br />
&#8220;If, therefore, you want my father to give you an escort and to help<br />
you home, do as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars<br />
by the road side dedicated to Minerva; it has a well in it and a<br />
meadow all round it. Here my father has a field of rich garden ground,<br />
about as far from the town as a man&#8217; voice will carry. Sit down<br />
there and wait for a while till the rest of us can get into the town<br />
and reach my father&#8217;s house. Then, when you think we must have done<br />
this, come into the town and ask the way to the house of my father<br />
Alcinous. You will have no difficulty in finding it; any child will<br />
point it out to you, for no one else in the whole town has anything<br />
like such a fine house as he has. When you have got past the gates and<br />
through the outer court, go right across the inner court till you come<br />
to my mother. You will find her sitting by the fire and spinning her<br />
purple wool by firelight. It is a fine sight to see her as she leans<br />
back against one of the bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behind<br />
her. Close to her seat stands that of my father, on which he sits<br />
and topes like an immortal god. Never mind him, but go up to my<br />
mother, and lay your hands upon her knees if you would get home<br />
quickly. If you can gain her over, you may hope to see your own<br />
country again, no matter how distant it may be.&#8221;<br />
So saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the<br />
river. The mules drew well and their hoofs went up and down upon the<br />
road. She was careful not to go too fast for Ulysses and the maids who<br />
were following on foot along with the waggon, so she plied her whip<br />
with judgement. As the sun was going down they came to the sacred<br />
grove of Minerva, and there Ulysses sat down and prayed to the<br />
mighty daughter of Jove.<br />
&#8220;Hear me,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable,<br />
hear me now, for you gave no heed to my prayers when Neptune was<br />
wrecking me. Now, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that I may<br />
find friends and be hospitably received by the Phaecians.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not<br />
show herself to him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune,<br />
who was still furious in his endeavors to prevent Ulysses from getting<br />
home.</p>
<p>
BOOK VII</p>
<p>THUS, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on to<br />
the town. When she reached her father&#8217;s house she drew up at the<br />
gateway, and her brothers- comely as the gods- gathered round her,<br />
took the mules out of the waggon, and carried the clothes into the<br />
house, while she went to her own room, where an old servant,<br />
Eurymedusa of Apeira, lit the fire for her. This old woman had been<br />
brought by sea from Apeira, and had been chosen as a prize for<br />
Alcinous because he was king over the Phaecians, and the people obeyed<br />
him as though he were a god. She had been nurse to Nausicaa, and had<br />
now lit the fire for her, and brought her supper for her into her<br />
own room.<br />
Presently Ulysses got up to go towards the town; and Minerva shed<br />
a thick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proud<br />
Phaecians who met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was.<br />
Then, as he was just entering the town, she came towards him in the<br />
likeness of a little girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front<br />
of him, and Ulysses said:<br />
&#8220;My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of king<br />
Alcinous? I am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not know<br />
one in your town and country.&#8221;<br />
Then Minerva said, &#8220;Yes, father stranger, I will show you the<br />
house you want, for Alcinous lives quite close to my own father. I<br />
will go before you and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and<br />
do not look at any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here<br />
cannot abide strangers, and do not like men who come from some other<br />
place. They are a sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace of<br />
Neptune in ships that glide along like thought, or as a bird in the<br />
air.&#8221;<br />
On this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but<br />
not one of the Phaecians could see him as he passed through the city<br />
in the midst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will<br />
towards him had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired<br />
their harbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of<br />
the city, which, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking,<br />
and when they reached the king&#8217;s house Minerva said:<br />
&#8220;This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show<br />
you. You will find a number of great people sitting at table, but do<br />
not be afraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likely<br />
he is to carry his point, even though he is a stranger. First find the<br />
queen. Her name is Arete, and she comes of the same family as her<br />
husband Alcinous. They both descend originally from Neptune, who was<br />
father to Nausithous by Periboea, a woman of great beauty. Periboea<br />
was the youngest daughter of Eurymedon, who at one time reigned over<br />
the giants, but he ruined his ill-fated people and lost his own life<br />
to boot.<br />
&#8220;Neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by<br />
him, the great Nausithous, who reigned over the Phaecians.<br />
Nausithous had two sons Rhexenor and Alcinous; Apollo killed the first<br />
of them while he was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he<br />
left a daughter Arete, whom Alcinous married, and honours as no<br />
other woman is honoured of all those that keep house along with<br />
their husbands.<br />
&#8220;Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her<br />
children, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, who look<br />
upon her as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city,<br />
for she is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and when<br />
any women are friends of hers, she will help their husbands also to<br />
settle their disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have<br />
every hope of seeing your friends again, and getting safely back to<br />
your home and country.&#8221;<br />
Then Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to<br />
Marathon and to the spacious streets of Athens, where she entered<br />
the abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on to the house of Alcinous,<br />
and he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the<br />
threshold of bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that<br />
of the sun or moon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end<br />
to end, and the cornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and<br />
hung on pillars of silver that rose from a floor of bronze, while<br />
the lintel was silver and the hook of the door was of gold.<br />
On either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan,<br />
with his consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watch<br />
over the palace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and could<br />
never grow old. Seats were ranged all along the wall, here and there<br />
from one end to the other, with coverings of fine woven work which the<br />
women of the house had made. Here the chief persons of the Phaecians<br />
used to sit and eat and drink, for there was abundance at all seasons;<br />
and there were golden figures of young men with lighted torches in<br />
their hands, raised on pedestals, to give light by night to those<br />
who were at table. There are fifty maid servants in the house, some of<br />
whom are always grinding rich yellow grain at the mill, while others<br />
work at the loom, or sit and spin, and their shuttles go, backwards<br />
and forwards like the fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen is<br />
so closely woven that it will turn oil. As the Phaecians are the<br />
best sailors in the world, so their women excel all others in weaving,<br />
for Minerva has taught them all manner of useful arts, and they are<br />
very intelligent.<br />
Outside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about<br />
four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful trees-<br />
pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are luscious<br />
figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor fail<br />
all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so<br />
soft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows<br />
on pear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the<br />
grapes, for there is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a<br />
part of this, the grapes are being made into raisins; in another<br />
part they are being gathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs,<br />
others further on have shed their blossom and are beginning to show<br />
fruit, others again are just changing colour. In the furthest part<br />
of the ground there are beautifully arranged beds of flowers that<br />
are in bloom all the year round. Two streams go through it, the one<br />
turned in ducts throughout the whole garden, while the other is<br />
carried under the ground of the outer court to the house itself, and<br />
the town&#8217;s people draw water from it. Such, then, were the<br />
splendours with which the gods had endowed the house of king Alcinous.<br />
So here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when<br />
he had looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the<br />
precincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among<br />
the Phaecians making their drink-offerings to Mercury, which they<br />
always did the last thing before going away for the night. He went<br />
straight through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness in<br />
which Minerva had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and King<br />
Alcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and at<br />
that moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became<br />
visible. Every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there,<br />
but Ulysses began at once with his petition.<br />
&#8220;Queen Arete,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;daughter of great Rhexenor, in my<br />
distress I humbly pray you, as also your husband and these your guests<br />
(whom may heaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may they<br />
leave their possessions to their children, and all the honours<br />
conferred upon them by the state) to help me home to my own country as<br />
soon as possible; for I have been long in trouble and away from my<br />
friends.&#8221;<br />
Then he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held<br />
their peace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an<br />
excellent speaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in<br />
all honesty addressed them thus:<br />
&#8220;Alcinous,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is not creditable to you that a stranger<br />
should be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is<br />
waiting to hear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise and<br />
take a seat on a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mix<br />
some wine and water that we may make a drink-offering to Jove the lord<br />
of thunder, who takes all well-disposed suppliants under his<br />
protection; and let the housekeeper give him some supper, of<br />
whatever there may be in the house.&#8221;<br />
When Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him<br />
from the hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who had<br />
been sitting beside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant<br />
then brought him water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a<br />
silver basin for him to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table<br />
beside him; an upper servant brought him bread and offered him many<br />
good things of what there was in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank.<br />
Then Alcinous said to one of the servants, &#8220;Pontonous, mix a cup of<br />
wine and hand it round that we may make drink-offerings to Jove the<br />
lord of thunder, who is the protector of all well-disposed<br />
suppliants.&#8221;<br />
Pontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after<br />
giving every man his drink-offering. When they had made their<br />
offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:<br />
&#8220;Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You<br />
have had your supper, so now go home to bed. To-morrow morning I shall<br />
invite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a<br />
sacrificial banquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the<br />
question of his escort, and consider how we may at once send him<br />
back rejoicing to his own country without trouble or inconvenience<br />
to himself, no matter how distant it may be. We must see that he comes<br />
to no harm while on his homeward journey, but when he is once at<br />
home he will have to take the luck he was born with for better or<br />
worse like other people. It is possible, however, that the stranger is<br />
one of the immortals who has come down from heaven to visit us; but in<br />
this case the gods are departing from their usual practice, for<br />
hitherto they have made themselves perfectly clear to us when we<br />
have been offering them hecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts<br />
just like one of our selves, and if any solitary wayfarer happens to<br />
stumble upon some one or other of them, they affect no concealment,<br />
for we are as near of kin to the gods as the Cyclopes and the savage<br />
giants are.&#8221;<br />
Then Ulysses said: &#8220;Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion into<br />
your head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body<br />
nor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most<br />
afflicted. Indeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit<br />
to lay upon me, you would say that I was still worse off than they<br />
are. Nevertheless, let me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach<br />
is a very importunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man&#8217;s notice no<br />
matter how dire is his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists<br />
that I shall eat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows<br />
and dwell only on the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves,<br />
do as you propose, and at break of day set about helping me to get<br />
home. I shall be content to die if I may first once more behold my<br />
property, my bondsmen, and all the greatness of my house.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he<br />
should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when<br />
they had made their drink-offerings, and had drunk each as much as<br />
he was minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode,<br />
leaving Ulysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the<br />
servants were taking the things away after supper. Arete was the first<br />
to speak, for she recognized the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that<br />
Ulysses was wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she<br />
said, &#8220;Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I<br />
should like to ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you<br />
those clothes? Did you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?&#8221;<br />
And Ulysses answered, &#8220;It would be a long story Madam, were I to<br />
relate in full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven<br />
has been laid heavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an<br />
island far away in the sea which is called &#8216;the Ogygian.&#8217; Here<br />
dwells the cunning and powerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas.<br />
She lives by herself far from all neighbours human or divine. Fortune,<br />
however, me to her hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my<br />
ship with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave<br />
comrades were drowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and<br />
was carried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at<br />
last during the darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the<br />
Ogygian island where the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me in<br />
and treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make<br />
me immortal that I might never grow old, but she could not persuade me<br />
to let her do so.<br />
&#8220;I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and watered<br />
the good clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time;<br />
but at last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of<br />
her own free will, either because Jove had told her she must, or<br />
because she had changed her mind. She sent me from her island on a<br />
raft, which she provisioned with abundance of bread and wine. Moreover<br />
she gave me good stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew both<br />
warm and fair. Days seven and ten did I sail over the sea, and on<br />
the eighteenth I caught sight of the first outlines of the mountains<br />
upon your coast- and glad indeed was I to set eyes upon them.<br />
Nevertheless there was still much trouble in store for me, for at this<br />
point Neptune would let me go no further, and raised a great storm<br />
against me; the sea was so terribly high that I could no longer keep<br />
to my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of the gale, and I had<br />
to swim for it, till wind and current brought me to your shores.<br />
&#8220;There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place and<br />
the waves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the sea<br />
and swam on till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing<br />
place, for there were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind.<br />
Here, then, I got out of the water and gathered my senses together<br />
again. Night was coming on, so I left the river, and went into a<br />
thicket, where I covered myself all over with leaves, and presently<br />
heaven sent me off into a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I<br />
slept among the leaves all night, and through the next day till<br />
afternoon, when I woke as the sun was westering, and saw your<br />
daughter&#8217;s maid servants playing upon the beach, and your daughter<br />
among them looking like a goddess. I besought her aid, and she<br />
proved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so than could be<br />
expected from so young a person- for young people are apt to be<br />
thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she had<br />
had me washed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which you<br />
see me. Now, therefore, though it has pained me to do so, I have<br />
told you the whole truth.&#8221;<br />
Then Alcinous said, &#8220;Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter<br />
not to bring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeing<br />
that she was the first person whose aid you asked.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Pray do not scold her,&#8221; replied Ulysses; &#8220;she is not to blame.<br />
She did tell me to follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed<br />
and afraid, for I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw<br />
me. Every human being is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Stranger,&#8221; replied Alcinous, &#8220;I am not the kind of man to get angry<br />
about nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father<br />
Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you are,<br />
and how much you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry my<br />
daughter, and become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give you a<br />
house and an estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you here<br />
against your own wish, and that you may be sure of this I will<br />
attend to-morrow to the matter of your escort. You can sleep during<br />
the whole voyage if you like, and the men shall sail you over smooth<br />
waters either to your own home, or wherever you please, even though it<br />
be a long way further off than Euboea, which those of my people who<br />
saw it when they took yellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus the son<br />
of Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any place- and yet they did the<br />
whole voyage in a single day without distressing themselves, and<br />
came back again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships<br />
excel all others, and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are.&#8221;<br />
Then was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, &#8220;Father Jove, grant<br />
that Alcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win an<br />
imperishable name among mankind, and at the same time I shall return<br />
to my country.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in<br />
the room that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs,<br />
and to spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for<br />
Ulysses to wear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their<br />
hands, and when they had made the bed they came up to Ulysses and<br />
said, &#8220;Rise, sir stranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,&#8221;<br />
and glad indeed was he to go to his rest.<br />
So Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway;<br />
but Alcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his<br />
wife by his side.</p>
<p>
BOOK VIII</p>
<p>NOW when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,<br />
Alcinous and Ulysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way to the<br />
Phaecian place of assembly, which was near the ships. When they got<br />
there they sat down side by side on a seat of polished stone, while<br />
Minerva took the form of one of Alcinous&#8217; servants, and went round the<br />
town in order to help Ulysses to get home. She went up to the<br />
citizens, man by man, and said, &#8220;Aldermen and town councillors of<br />
the Phaeacians, come to the assembly all of you and listen to the<br />
stranger who has just come off a long voyage to the house of King<br />
Alcinous; he looks like an immortal god.&#8221;<br />
With these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked to<br />
the assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every<br />
one was struck with the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had<br />
beautified him about the head and shoulders, making him look taller<br />
and stouter than he really was, that he might impress the Phaecians<br />
favourably as being a very remarkable man, and might come off well<br />
in the many trials of skill to which they would challenge him. Then,<br />
when they were got together, Alcinous spoke:<br />
&#8220;Hear me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;aldermen and town councillors of the<br />
Phaeacians, that I may speak even as I am minded. This stranger,<br />
whoever he may be, has found his way to my house from somewhere or<br />
other either East or West. He wants an escort and wishes to have the<br />
matter settled. Let us then get one ready for him, as we have done for<br />
others before him; indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house has<br />
been able to complain of me for not speeding on his way soon enough.<br />
Let us draw a ship into the sea- one that has never yet made a voyage-<br />
and man her with two and fifty of our smartest young sailors. Then<br />
when you have made fast your oars each by his own seat, leave the ship<br />
and come to my house to prepare a feast. I will find you in<br />
everything. I am giving will these instructions to the young men who<br />
will form the crew, for as regards you aldermen and town<br />
councillors, you will join me in entertaining our guest in the<br />
cloisters. I can take no excuses, and we will have Demodocus to sing<br />
to us; for there is no bard like him whatever he may choose to sing<br />
about.&#8221;<br />
Alcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while a<br />
servant went to fetch Demodocus. The fifty-two picked oarsmen went<br />
to the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they<br />
drew the ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound<br />
the oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in<br />
due course, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel a<br />
little way out from land, and then came on shore and went to the house<br />
of King Alcinous. The outhouses, yards, and all the precincts were<br />
filled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young;<br />
and Alcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two<br />
oxen. These they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent<br />
banquet.<br />
A servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the<br />
muse had dearly loved, but to whom she had given both good and evil,<br />
for though she had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had<br />
robbed him of his eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among the<br />
guests, leaning it up against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him<br />
on a peg over his head, and showed him where he was to feel for it<br />
with his hands. He also set a fair table with a basket of victuals<br />
by his side, and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever he<br />
was so disposed.<br />
The company then laid their hands upon the good things that were<br />
before them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,<br />
the muse inspired Demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and more<br />
especially a matter that was then in the mouths of all men, to wit,<br />
the quarrel between Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words that<br />
they heaped on one another as they gat together at a banquet. But<br />
Agamemnon was glad when he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one<br />
another, for Apollo had foretold him this at Pytho when he crossed the<br />
stone floor to consult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the<br />
evil that by the will of Jove fell both Danaans and Trojans.<br />
Thus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head<br />
and covered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see<br />
that he was weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears<br />
from his eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a<br />
drink-offering to the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed<br />
Demodocus to sing further, for they delighted in his lays, then<br />
Ulysses again drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly. No<br />
one noticed his distress except Alcinous, who was sitting near him,<br />
and heard the heavy sighs that he was heaving. So he at once said,<br />
&#8220;Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough<br />
now, both of the feast, and of the minstrelsy that is its due<br />
accompaniment; let us proceed therefore to the athletic sports, so<br />
that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends<br />
how much we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers,<br />
and runners.&#8221;<br />
With these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A<br />
servant hung Demodocus&#8217;s lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the<br />
cloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the<br />
chief men of the Phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd of<br />
several thousands of people followed them, and there were many<br />
excellent competitors for all the prizes. Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus,<br />
Nauteus, Prymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon,<br />
Anabesineus, and Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was<br />
also Euryalus son of Naubolus, who was like Mars himself, and was<br />
the best looking man among the Phaecians except Laodamas. Three sons<br />
of Alcinous, Laodamas, Halios, and Clytoneus, competed also.<br />
The foot races came first. The course was set out for them from<br />
the starting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all<br />
flew forward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long<br />
way; he left every one else behind him by the length of the furrow<br />
that a couple of mules can plough in a fallow field. They then<br />
turned to the painful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to be<br />
the best man. Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at<br />
throwing the disc there was no one who could approach Elatreus.<br />
Alcinous&#8217;s son Laodamas was the best boxer, and he it was who<br />
presently said, when they had all been diverted with the games, &#8220;Let<br />
us ask the stranger whether he excels in any of these sports; he seems<br />
very powerfully built; his thighs, claves, hands, and neck are of<br />
prodigious strength, nor is he at all old, but he has suffered much<br />
lately, and there is nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man,<br />
no matter how strong he is.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You are quite right, Laodamas,&#8221; replied Euryalus, &#8220;go up to your<br />
guest and speak to him about it yourself.&#8221;<br />
When Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the<br />
crowd and said to Ulysses, &#8220;I hope, Sir, that you will enter<br />
yourself for some one or other of our competitions if you are<br />
skilled in any of them- and you must have gone in for many a one<br />
before now. There is nothing that does any one so much credit all<br />
his life long as the showing himself a proper man with his hands and<br />
feet. Have a try therefore at something, and banish all sorrow from<br />
your mind. Your return home will not be long delayed, for the ship<br />
is already drawn into the water, and the crew is found.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses answered, &#8220;Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? my<br />
mind is set rather on cares than contests; I have been through<br />
infinite trouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, praying<br />
your king and people to further me on my return home.&#8221;<br />
Then Euryalus reviled him outright and said, &#8220;I gather, then, that<br />
you are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight<br />
in. I suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about in<br />
ships as captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but of<br />
their outward freights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem to be<br />
much of the athlete about you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;For shame, Sir,&#8221; answered Ulysses, fiercely, &#8220;you are an insolent<br />
fellow- so true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in<br />
speech, person, and understanding. One man may be of weak presence,<br />
but heaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that he<br />
charms every one who sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his<br />
hearers with him so that he is leader in all assemblies of his<br />
fellows, and wherever he goes he is looked up to. Another may be as<br />
handsome as a god, but his good looks are not crowned with discretion.<br />
This is your case. No god could make a finer looking fellow than you<br />
are, but you are a fool. Your ill-judged remarks have made me<br />
exceedingly angry, and you are quite mistaken, for I excel in a<br />
great many athletic exercises; indeed, so long as I had youth and<br />
strength, I was among the first athletes of the age. Now, however, I<br />
am worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have gone through much both on<br />
the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; still, in spite<br />
of all this I will compete, for your taunts have stung me to the<br />
quick.&#8221;<br />
So he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a<br />
disc, larger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the<br />
Phaeacians when disc-throwing among themselves. Then, swinging it<br />
back, he threw it from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in<br />
the air as he did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of<br />
its flight as it sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any<br />
mark that had been made yet. Minerva, in the form of a man, came and<br />
marked the place where it had fallen. &#8220;A blind man, Sir,&#8221; said she,<br />
&#8220;could easily tell your mark by groping for it- it is so far ahead<br />
of any other. You may make your mind easy about this contest, for no<br />
Phaeacian can come near to such a throw as yours.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on,<br />
so he began to speak more pleasantly. &#8220;Young men,&#8221; said he, &#8220;come up<br />
to that throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or<br />
even heavier. If anyone wants to have a bout with me let him come<br />
on, for I am exceedingly angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I do<br />
not care what it is, with any man of you all except Laodamas, but<br />
not with him because I am his guest, and one cannot compete with one&#8217;s<br />
own personal friend. At least I do not think it a prudent or a<br />
sensible thing for a guest to challenge his host&#8217;s family at any game,<br />
especially when he is in a foreign country. He will cut the ground<br />
from under his own feet if he does; but I make no exception as regards<br />
any one else, for I want to have the matter out and know which is<br />
the best man. I am a good hand at every kind of athletic sport known<br />
among mankind. I am an excellent archer. In battle I am always the<br />
first to bring a man down with my arrow, no matter how many more are<br />
taking aim at him alongside of me. Philoctetes was the only man who<br />
could shoot better than I could when we Achaeans were before Troy<br />
and in practice. I far excel every one else in the whole world, of<br />
those who still eat bread upon the face of the earth, but I should not<br />
like to shoot against the mighty dead, such as Hercules, or Eurytus<br />
the Cechalian-men who could shoot against the gods themselves. This in<br />
fact was how Eurytus came prematurely by his end, for Apollo was angry<br />
with him and killed him because he challenged him as an archer. I<br />
can throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an arrow. Running<br />
is the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of the<br />
Phaecians might beat me, for I have been brought down very low at sea;<br />
my provisions ran short, and therefore I am still weak.&#8221;<br />
They all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, &#8220;Sir,<br />
we have had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from<br />
which I understand that you are willing to show your prowess, as<br />
having been displeased with some insolent remarks that have been<br />
made to you by one of our athletes, and which could never have been<br />
uttered by any one who knows how to talk with propriety. I hope you<br />
will apprehend my meaning, and will explain to any be one of your<br />
chief men who may be dining with yourself and your family when you get<br />
home, that we have an hereditary aptitude for accomplishments of all<br />
kinds. We are not particularly remarkable for our boxing, nor yet as<br />
wrestlers, but we are singularly fleet of foot and are excellent<br />
sailors. We are extremely fond of good dinners, music, and dancing; we<br />
also like frequent changes of linen, warm baths, and good beds, so<br />
now, please, some of you who are the best dancers set about dancing,<br />
that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends<br />
how much we surpass all other nations as sailors, runners, dancers,<br />
minstrels. Demodocus has left his lyre at my house, so run some one or<br />
other of you and fetch it for him.&#8221;<br />
On this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king&#8217;s<br />
house, and the nine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward.<br />
It was their business to manage everything connected with the<br />
sports, so they made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the<br />
dancers. Presently the servant came back with Demodocus&#8217;s lyre, and he<br />
took his place in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers in<br />
the town began to foot and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses was<br />
delighted with the merry twinkling of their feet.<br />
Meanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and<br />
how they first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars<br />
made Venus many presents, and defiled King Vulcan&#8217;s marriage bed, so<br />
the sun, who saw what they were about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very<br />
angry when he heard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy<br />
brooding mischief, got his great anvil into its place, and began to<br />
forge some chains which none could either unloose or break, so that<br />
they might stay there in that place. When he had finished his snare he<br />
went into his bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains<br />
like cobwebs; he also let many hang down from the great beam of the<br />
ceiling. Not even a god could see them, so fine and subtle were<br />
they. As soon as he had spread the chains all over the bed, he made as<br />
though he were setting out for the fair state of Lemnos, which of<br />
all places in the world was the one he was most fond of. But Mars kept<br />
no blind look out, and as soon as he saw him start, hurried off to his<br />
house, burning with love for Venus.<br />
Now Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, and<br />
was about sitting down when Mars came inside the house, an said as<br />
he took her hand in his own, &#8220;Let us go to the couch of Vulcan: he<br />
is not at home, but is gone off to Lemnos among the Sintians, whose<br />
speech is barbarous.&#8221;<br />
She was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take their<br />
rest, whereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had<br />
spread for them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but<br />
found too late that they were in a trap. Then Vulcan came up to<br />
them, for he had turned back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout<br />
the sun told him what was going on. He was in a furious passion, and<br />
stood in the vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to all<br />
the gods.<br />
&#8220;Father Jove,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and all you other blessed gods who live<br />
for ever, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight<br />
that I will show you. Jove&#8217;s daughter Venus is always dishonouring<br />
me because I am lame. She is in love with Mars, who is handsome and<br />
clean built, whereas I am a cripple- but my parents are to blame for<br />
that, not I; they ought never to have begotten me. Come and see the<br />
pair together asleep on my bed. It makes me furious to look at them.<br />
They are very fond of one another, but I do not think they will lie<br />
there longer than they can help, nor do I think that they will sleep<br />
much; there, however, they shall stay till her father has repaid me<br />
the sum I gave him for his baggage of a daughter, who is fair but<br />
not honest.&#8221;<br />
On this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling<br />
Neptune came, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but<br />
the goddesses stayed at home all of them for shame. Then the givers of<br />
all good things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared with<br />
inextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had been,<br />
whereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:<br />
&#8220;Ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how<br />
limping Vulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars who is the fleetest god<br />
in heaven; and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse, but King Apollo said to Mercury,<br />
&#8220;Messenger Mercury, giver of good things, you would not care how<br />
strong the chains were, would you, if you could sleep with Venus?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;King Apollo,&#8221; answered Mercury, &#8220;I only wish I might get the<br />
chance, though there were three times as many chains- and you might<br />
look on, all of you, gods and goddesses, but would sleep with her if I<br />
could.&#8221;<br />
The immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but<br />
Neptune took it all seriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan to set<br />
Mars free again. &#8220;Let him go,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and I will undertake, as you<br />
require, that he shall pay you all the damages that are held<br />
reasonable among the immortal gods.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Do not,&#8221; replied Vulcan, &#8220;ask me to do this; a bad man&#8217;s bond is<br />
bad security; what remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should<br />
go away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Vulcan,&#8221; said Neptune, &#8220;if Mars goes away without paying his<br />
damages, I will pay you myself.&#8221; So Vulcan answered, &#8220;In this case I<br />
cannot and must not refuse you.&#8221;<br />
Thereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they<br />
were free they scampered off, Mars to Thrace and laughter-loving Venus<br />
to Cyprus and to Paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant<br />
with burnt offerings. Here the Graces hathed her, and anointed her<br />
with oil of ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and they<br />
clothed her in raiment of the most enchanting beauty.<br />
Thus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians<br />
were charmed as they heard him.<br />
Then Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there was<br />
no one to compete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybus had<br />
made for them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw it<br />
up towards the clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground<br />
and caught it with ease before it came down again. When they had<br />
done throwing the ball straight up into the air they began to dance,<br />
and at the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards to one<br />
another, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a<br />
great stamping with their feet. Then Ulysses said:<br />
&#8220;King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in<br />
the world, and indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I was<br />
astonished as I saw them.&#8221;<br />
The king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaecians<br />
&#8220;Aldermen and town councillors, our guest seems to be a person of<br />
singular judgement; let us give him such proof of our hospitality as<br />
he may reasonably expect. There are twelve chief men among you, and<br />
counting myself there are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean<br />
cloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in<br />
a lump down at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so with<br />
a light heart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apology<br />
and a present too, for he has been rude.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying,<br />
and sent their servants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said,<br />
&#8220;King Alcinous, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you<br />
require. He shall have sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt,<br />
which is of silver. I will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn<br />
ivory into which it fits. It will be worth a great deal to him.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said,<br />
&#8220;Good luck to you, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss<br />
may the winds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a<br />
safe return, for I understand you have been long away from home, and<br />
have gone through much hardship.&#8221;<br />
To which Ulysses answered, &#8220;Good luck to you too my friend, and<br />
may the gods grant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the<br />
sword you have given me along with your apology.&#8221;<br />
With these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards<br />
sundown the presents began to make their appearance, as the servants<br />
of the donors kept bringing them to the house of King Alcinous; here<br />
his sons received them, and placed them under their mother&#8217;s charge.<br />
Then Alcinous led the way to the house and bade his guests take<br />
their seats.<br />
&#8220;Wife,&#8221; said he, turning to Queen Arete, &#8220;Go, fetch the best chest<br />
we have, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper<br />
on the fire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath;<br />
see also to the careful packing of the presents that the noble<br />
Phaeacians have made him; he will thus better enjoy both his supper<br />
and the singing that will follow. I shall myself give him this<br />
golden goblet- which is of exquisite workmanship- that he may be<br />
reminded of me for the rest of his life whenever he makes a<br />
drink-offering to Jove, or to any of the gods.&#8221;<br />
Then Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as<br />
fast as they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to<br />
a clear fire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the water<br />
became hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod.<br />
Meanwhile Arete brought a magnificent chest her own room, and inside<br />
it she packed all the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the<br />
Phaeacians had brought. Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from<br />
Alcinous, and said to Ulysses:<br />
&#8220;See to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once,<br />
for fear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in your<br />
ship.&#8221;<br />
When Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast<br />
with a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done so before an<br />
upper servant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. He was<br />
very glad of a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon him<br />
ever since he left the house of Calypso, who as long as he remained<br />
with her had taken as good care of him as though he had been a god.<br />
When the servants had done washing and anointing him with oil, and had<br />
given him a clean cloak and shirt, he left the bath room and joined<br />
the guests who were sitting over their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood<br />
by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof if the cloister, and<br />
admired him as she saw him pass. &#8220;Farewell stranger,&#8221; said she, &#8220;do<br />
not forget me when you are safe at home again, for it is to me first<br />
that you owe a ransom for having saved your life.&#8221;<br />
And Ulysses said, &#8220;Nausicaa, daughter of great Alcinous, may Jove<br />
the mighty husband of Juno, grant that I may reach my home; so shall I<br />
bless you as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you who saved<br />
me.&#8221;<br />
When he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper was<br />
then served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in the<br />
favourite bard Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company,<br />
near one of the bearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he might<br />
lean against it. Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork with<br />
plenty of fat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and said<br />
to a servant, &#8220;Take this piece of pork over to Demodocus and tell<br />
him to eat it; for all the pain his lays may cause me I will salute<br />
him none the less; bards are honoured and respected throughout the<br />
world, for the muse teaches them their songs and loves them.&#8221;<br />
The servant carried the pork in his fingers over to Demodocus, who<br />
took it and was very much pleased. They then laid their hands on the<br />
good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had to<br />
eat and drink, Ulysses said to Demodocus, &#8220;Demodocus, there is no<br />
one in the world whom I admire more than I do you. You must have<br />
studied under the Muse, Jove&#8217;s daughter, and under Apollo, so<br />
accurately do you sing the return of the Achaeans with all their<br />
sufferings and adventures. If you were not there yourself, you must<br />
have heard it all from some one who was. Now, however, change your<br />
song and tell us of the wooden horse which Epeus made with the<br />
assistance of Minerva, and which Ulysses got by stratagem into the<br />
fort of Troy after freighting it with the men who afterwards sacked<br />
the city. If you will sing this tale aright I will tell all the<br />
world how magnificently heaven has endowed you.&#8221;<br />
The bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where<br />
some of the Argives set fire to their tents and sailed away while<br />
others, hidden within the horse, were waiting with Ulysses in the<br />
Trojan place of assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn the<br />
horse into their fortress, and it stood there while they sat in<br />
council round it, and were in three minds as to what they should do.<br />
Some were for breaking it up then and there; others would have it<br />
dragged to the top of the rock on which the fortress stood, and then<br />
thrown down the precipice; while yet others were for letting it remain<br />
as an offering and propitiation for the gods. And this was how they<br />
settled it in the end, for the city was doomed when it took in that<br />
horse, within which were all the bravest of the Argives waiting to<br />
bring death and destruction on the Trojans. Anon he sang how the<br />
sons of the Achaeans issued from the horse, and sacked the town,<br />
breaking out from their ambuscade. He sang how they over ran the<br />
city hither and thither and ravaged it, and how Ulysses went raging<br />
like Mars along with Menelaus to the house of Deiphobus. It was<br />
there that the fight raged most furiously, nevertheless by Minerva&#8217;s<br />
help he was victorious.<br />
All this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, and<br />
his cheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when she<br />
throws herself on the body of her husband who has fallen before his<br />
own city and people, fighting bravely in defence of his home and<br />
children. She screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies<br />
gasping for breath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behind<br />
about the back and shoulders, and carry her off into slavery, to a<br />
life of labour and sorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks-<br />
even so piteously did Ulysses weep, but none of those present<br />
perceived his tears except Alcinous, who was sitting near him, and<br />
could hear the sobs and sighs that he was heaving. The king,<br />
therefore, at once rose and said:<br />
&#8220;Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocus<br />
cease his song, for there are those present who do not seem to like<br />
it. From the moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began to<br />
sing, our guest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is<br />
evidently in great trouble, so let the bard leave off, that we may all<br />
enjoy ourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it<br />
should be, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presents<br />
that we are making with so much good will, are wholly in his honour,<br />
and any one with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he<br />
ought to treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own<br />
brother.<br />
&#8220;Therefore, Sir, do you on your part affect no more concealment<br />
nor reserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will be more<br />
polite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which<br />
your father and mother over yonder used to call you, and by which<br />
you were known among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. There is<br />
no one, neither rich nor poor, who is absolutely without any name<br />
whatever, for people&#8217;s fathers and mothers give them names as soon<br />
as they are born. Tell me also your country, nation, and city, that<br />
our ships may shape their purpose accordingly and take you there.<br />
For the Phaeacians have no pilots; their vessels have no rudders as<br />
those of other nations have, but the ships themselves understand<br />
what it is that we are thinking about and want; they know all the<br />
cities and countries in the whole world, and can traverse the sea just<br />
as well even when it is covered with mist and cloud, so that there<br />
is no danger of being wrecked or coming to any harm. Still I do<br />
remember hearing my father say that Neptune was angry with us for<br />
being too easy-going in the matter of giving people escorts. He said<br />
that one of these days he should wreck a ship of ours as it was<br />
returning from having escorted some one, and bury our city under a<br />
high mountain. This is what my used to say, but whether the god will<br />
carry out his threat or no is a matter which he will decide for<br />
himself.<br />
&#8220;And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering,<br />
and in what countries have you travelled? Tell us of the peoples<br />
themselves, and of their cities- who were hostile, savage and<br />
uncivilized, and who, on the other hand, hospitable and humane. Tell<br />
us also why you are made unhappy on hearing about the return of the<br />
Argive Danaans from Troy. The gods arranged all this, and sent them<br />
their misfortunes in order that future generations might have<br />
something to sing about. Did you lose some brave kinsman of your<br />
wife&#8217;s when you were before Troy? a son-in-law or father-in-law- which<br />
are the nearest relations a man has outside his own flesh and blood?<br />
or was it some brave and kindly-natured comrade- for a good friend<br />
is as dear to a man as his own brother?&#8221;</p>
<p>
BOOK IX</p>
<p>AND ULYSSES answered, &#8220;King Alcinous, it is a good thing to hear a<br />
bard with such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing better<br />
or more delightful than when a whole people make merry together,<br />
with the guests sitting orderly to listen, while the table is loaded<br />
with bread and meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his<br />
cup for every man. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see.<br />
Now, however, since you are inclined to ask the story of my sorrows,<br />
and rekindle my own sad memories in respect of them, I do not know how<br />
to begin, nor yet how to continue and conclude my tale, for the hand<br />
of heaven has been laid heavily upon me.<br />
&#8220;Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you too may know it,<br />
and one day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my there<br />
guests though I live so far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son<br />
of Laertes, reknowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety, so<br />
that my fame ascends to heaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is a<br />
high mountain called Neritum, covered with forests; and not far from<br />
it there is a group of islands very near to one another- Dulichium,<br />
Same, and the wooded island of Zacynthus. It lies squat on the<br />
horizon, all highest up in the sea towards the sunset, while the<br />
others lie away from it towards dawn. It is a rugged island, but it<br />
breeds brave men, and my eyes know none that they better love to<br />
look upon. The goddess Calypso kept me with her in her cave, and<br />
wanted me to marry her, as did also the cunning Aeaean goddess<br />
Circe; but they could neither of them persuade me, for there is<br />
nothing dearer to a man than his own country and his parents, and<br />
however splendid a home he may have in a foreign country, if it be far<br />
from father or mother, he does not care about it. Now, however, I will<br />
tell you of the many hazardous adventures which by Jove&#8217;s will I met<br />
with on my return from Troy.<br />
&#8220;When I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismarus, which<br />
is the city of the Cicons. There I sacked the town and put the<br />
people to the sword. We took their wives and also much booty, which we<br />
divided equitably amongst us, so that none might have reason to<br />
complain. I then said that we had better make off at once, but my<br />
men very foolishly would not obey me, so they stayed there drinking<br />
much wine and killing great numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea<br />
shore. Meanwhile the Cicons cried out for help to other Cicons who<br />
lived inland. These were more in number, and stronger, and they were<br />
more skilled in the art of war, for they could fight, either from<br />
chariots or on foot as the occasion served; in the morning, therefore,<br />
they came as thick as leaves and bloom in summer, and the hand of<br />
heaven was against us, so that we were hard pressed. They set the<br />
battle in array near the ships, and the hosts aimed their<br />
bronze-shod spears at one another. So long as the day waxed and it was<br />
still morning, we held our own against them, though they were more<br />
in number than we; but as the sun went down, towards the time when men<br />
loose their oxen, the Cicons got the better of us, and we lost half<br />
a dozen men from every ship we had; so we got away with those that<br />
were left.<br />
&#8220;Thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have<br />
escaped death though we had lost our comrades, nor did we leave till<br />
we had thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows who had perished by<br />
the hands of the Cicons. Then Jove raised the North wind against us<br />
till it blew a hurricane, so that land and sky were hidden in thick<br />
clouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships<br />
run before the gale, but the force of the wind tore our sails to<br />
tatters, so we took them down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed our<br />
hardest towards the land. There we lay two days and two nights<br />
suffering much alike from toil and distress of mind, but on the<br />
morning of the third day we again raised our masts, set sail, and took<br />
our places, letting the wind and steersmen direct our ship. I should<br />
have got home at that time unharmed had not the North wind and the<br />
currents been against me as I was doubling Cape Malea, and set me<br />
off my course hard by the island of Cythera.<br />
&#8220;I was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the<br />
sea, but on the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus-eater,<br />
who live on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed to<br />
take in fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the shore<br />
near the ships. When they had eaten and drunk I sent two of my company<br />
to see what manner of men the people of the place might be, and they<br />
had a third man under them. They started at once, and went about among<br />
the Lotus-eaters, who did them no hurt, but gave them to eat of the<br />
lotus, which was so delicious that those who ate of it left off caring<br />
about home, and did not even want to go back and say what had happened<br />
to them, but were for staying and munching lotus with the<br />
Lotus-eater without thinking further of their return; nevertheless,<br />
though they wept bitterly I forced them back to the ships and made<br />
them fast under the benches. Then I told the rest to go on board at<br />
once, lest any of them should taste of the lotus and leave off wanting<br />
to get home, so they took their places and smote the grey sea with<br />
their oars.<br />
&#8220;We sailed hence, always in much distress, till we came to the<br />
land of the lawless and inhuman Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes neither<br />
plant nor plough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat,<br />
barley, and grapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage, and their<br />
wild grapes yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them.<br />
They have no laws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on<br />
the tops of high mountains; each is lord and master in his family, and<br />
they take no account of their neighbours.<br />
&#8220;Now off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island not<br />
quite close to the land of the Cyclopes, but still not far. It is<br />
overrun with wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and are<br />
never disturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen- who as a rule will<br />
suffer so much hardship in forest or among mountain precipices- do not<br />
go there, nor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it lies a<br />
wilderness untilled and unsown from year to year, and has no living<br />
thing upon it but only goats. For the Cyclopes have no ships, nor<br />
yet shipwrights who could make ships for them; they cannot therefore<br />
go from city to city, or sail over the sea to one another&#8217;s country as<br />
people who have ships can do; if they had had these they would have<br />
colonized the island, for it is a very good one, and would yield<br />
everything in due season. There are meadows that in some places come<br />
right down to the sea shore, well watered and full of luscious<br />
grass; grapes would do there excellently; there is level land for<br />
ploughing, and it would always yield heavily at harvest time, for<br />
the soil is deep. There is a good harbour where no cables are<br />
wanted, nor yet anchors, nor need a ship be moored, but all one has to<br />
do is to beach one&#8217;s vessel and stay there till the wind becomes<br />
fair for putting out to sea again. At the head of the harbour there is<br />
a spring of clear water coming out of a cave, and there are poplars<br />
growing all round it.<br />
&#8220;Here we entered, but so dark was the night that some god must<br />
have brought us in, for there was nothing whatever to be seen. A thick<br />
mist hung all round our ships; the moon was hidden behind a mass of<br />
clouds so that no one could have seen the island if he had looked<br />
for it, nor were there any breakers to tell us we were close in<br />
shore before we found ourselves upon the land itself; when, however,<br />
we had beached the ships, we took down the sails, went ashore and<br />
camped upon the beach till daybreak.<br />
&#8220;When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we admired<br />
the island and wandered all over it, while the nymphs Jove&#8217;s daughters<br />
roused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner. On<br />
this we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships, and<br />
dividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats. Heaven<br />
sent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each ship got<br />
nine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong day<br />
to the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill,- and we had<br />
plenty of wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full<br />
when we sacked the city of the Cicons, and this had not yet run out.<br />
While we were feasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of<br />
the Cyclopes, which was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubble<br />
fires. We could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating of<br />
their sheep and goats, but when the sun went down and it came on dark,<br />
we camped down upon the beach, and next morning I called a council.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Stay here, my brave fellows,&#8217; said I, &#8216;all the rest of you,<br />
while I go with my ship and exploit these people myself: I want to see<br />
if they are uncivilized savages, or a hospitable and humane race.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;I went on board, bidding my men to do so also and loose the<br />
hawsers; so they took their places and smote the grey sea with their<br />
oars. When we got to the land, which was not far, there, on the face<br />
of a cliff near the sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It<br />
was a station for a great many sheep and goats, and outside there<br />
was a large yard, with a high wall round it made of stones built<br />
into the ground and of trees both pine and oak. This was the abode<br />
of a huge monster who was then away from home shepherding his<br />
flocks. He would have nothing to do with other people, but led the<br />
life of an outlaw. He was a horrid creature, not like a human being at<br />
all, but resembling rather some crag that stands out boldly against<br />
the sky on the top of a high mountain.<br />
&#8220;I told my men to draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were,<br />
all but the twelve best among them, who were to go along with<br />
myself. I also took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been<br />
given me by Maron, Apollo son of Euanthes, who was priest of Apollo<br />
the patron god of Ismarus, and lived within the wooded precincts of<br />
the temple. When we were sacking the city we respected him, and spared<br />
his life, as also his wife and child; so he made me some presents of<br />
great value- seven talents of fine gold, and a bowl of silver, with<br />
twelve jars of sweet wine, unblended, and of the most exquisite<br />
flavour. Not a man nor maid in the house knew about it, but only<br />
himself, his wife, and one housekeeper: when he drank it he mixed<br />
twenty parts of water to one of wine, and yet the fragrance from the<br />
mixing-bowl was so exquisite that it was impossible to refrain from<br />
drinking. I filled a large skin with this wine, and took a wallet full<br />
of provisions with me, for my mind misgave me that I might have to<br />
deal with some savage who would be of great strength, and would<br />
respect neither right nor law.<br />
&#8220;We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went<br />
inside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks<br />
were loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens<br />
could hold. They were kept in separate flocks; first there were the<br />
hoggets, then the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very<br />
young ones all kept apart from one another; as for his dairy, all<br />
the vessels, bowls, and milk pails into which he milked, were swimming<br />
with whey. When they saw all this, my men begged me to let them<br />
first steal some cheeses, and make off with them to the ship; they<br />
would then return, drive down the lambs and kids, put them on board<br />
and sail away with them. It would have been indeed better if we had<br />
done so but I would not listen to them, for I wanted to see the<br />
owner himself, in the hope that he might give me a present. When,<br />
however, we saw him my poor men found him ill to deal with.<br />
&#8220;We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others<br />
of them, and then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with his<br />
sheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry<br />
firewood to light the fire for his supper, and this he flung with such<br />
a noise on to the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fear<br />
at the far end of the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewes<br />
inside, as well as the she-goats that he was going to milk, leaving<br />
the males, both rams and he-goats, outside in the yards. Then he<br />
rolled a huge stone to the mouth of the cave- so huge that two and<br />
twenty strong four-wheeled waggons would not be enough to draw it from<br />
its place against the doorway. When he had so done he sat down and<br />
milked his ewes and goats, all in due course, and then let each of<br />
them have her own young. He curdled half the milk and set it aside<br />
in wicker strainers, but the other half he poured into bowls that he<br />
might drink it for his supper. When he had got through with all his<br />
work, he lit the fire, and then caught sight of us, whereon he said:<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Strangers, who are you? Where do sail from? Are you traders, or do<br />
you sail the as rovers, with your hands against every man, and every<br />
man&#8217;s hand against you?&#8217;<br />
&#8220;We were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and<br />
monstrous form, but I managed to say, &#8216;We are Achaeans on our way home<br />
from Troy, but by the will of Jove, and stress of weather, we have<br />
been driven far out of our course. We are the people of Agamemnon, son<br />
of Atreus, who has won infinite renown throughout the whole world,<br />
by sacking so great a city and killing so many people. We therefore<br />
humbly pray you to show us some hospitality, and otherwise make us<br />
such presents as visitors may reasonably expect. May your excellency<br />
fear the wrath of heaven, for we are your suppliants, and Jove takes<br />
all respectable travellers under his protection, for he is the avenger<br />
of all suppliants and foreigners in distress.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;To this he gave me but a pitiless answer, &#8216;Stranger,&#8217; said he, &#8216;you<br />
are a fool, or else you know nothing of this country. Talk to me,<br />
indeed, about fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes do<br />
not care about Jove or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever so<br />
much stronger than they. I shall not spare either yourself or your<br />
companions out of any regard for Jove, unless I am in the humour for<br />
doing so. And now tell me where you made your ship fast when you<br />
came on shore. Was it round the point, or is she lying straight off<br />
the land?&#8217;<br />
&#8220;He said this to draw me out, but I was too cunning to be caught<br />
in that way, so I answered with a lie; &#8216;Neptune,&#8217; said I, &#8216;sent my<br />
ship on to the rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it.<br />
We were driven on to them from the open sea, but I and those who are<br />
with me escaped the jaws of death.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;The cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with a<br />
sudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them down<br />
upon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains were<br />
shed upon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood. Then<br />
he tore them limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled them up<br />
like a lion in the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails,<br />
without leaving anything uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up our<br />
hands to heaven on seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not know<br />
what else to do; but when the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch,<br />
and had washed down his meal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk,<br />
he stretched himself full length upon the ground among his sheep,<br />
and went to sleep. I was at first inclined to seize my sword, draw it,<br />
and drive it into his vitals, but I reflected that if I did we<br />
should all certainly be lost, for we should never be able to shift the<br />
stone which the monster had put in front of the door. So we stayed<br />
sobbing and sighing where we were till morning came.<br />
&#8220;When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, he again<br />
lit his fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then<br />
let each have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with<br />
all his work, he clutched up two more of my men, and began eating them<br />
for his morning&#8217;s meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled the<br />
stone away from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put<br />
it back again- as easily as though he were merely clapping the lid<br />
on to a quiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done so he shouted,<br />
and cried &#8216;Shoo, shoo,&#8217; after his sheep to drive them on to the<br />
mountain; so I was left to scheme some way of taking my revenge and<br />
covering myself with glory.<br />
&#8220;In the end I deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows. The<br />
Cyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens;<br />
it was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending to use it<br />
for a staff as soon as it should be dry. It was so huge that we<br />
could only compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of<br />
large burden, and able to venture out into open sea. I went up to this<br />
club and cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece to the<br />
men and told them to fine it evenly off at one end, which they<br />
proceeded to do, and lastly I brought it to a point myself, charring<br />
the end in the fire to make it harder. When I had done this I hid it<br />
under dung, which was lying about all over the cave, and told the<br />
men to cast lots which of them should venture along with myself to<br />
lift it and bore it into the monster&#8217;s eye while he was asleep. The<br />
lot fell upon the very four whom I should have chosen, and I myself<br />
made five. In the evening the wretch came back from shepherding, and<br />
drove his flocks into the cave- this time driving them all inside, and<br />
not leaving any in the yards; I suppose some fancy must have taken<br />
him, or a god must have prompted him to do so. As soon as he had put<br />
the stone back to its place against the door, he sat down, milked<br />
his ewes and his goats all quite rightly, and then let each have her<br />
own young one; when he had got through with all this work, he<br />
gripped up two more of my men, and made his supper off them. So I went<br />
up to him with an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my hands:<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Look here, Cyclops,&#8217; said I, you have been eating a great deal<br />
of man&#8217;s flesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may see<br />
what kind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it to<br />
you as a drink-offering, in the hope that you would take compassion<br />
upon me and further me on my way home, whereas all you do is to go<br />
on ramping and raving most intolerably. You ought to be ashamed<br />
yourself; how can you expect people to come see you any more if you<br />
treat them in this way?&#8217;<br />
&#8220;He then took the cup and drank. He was so delighted with the<br />
taste of the wine that he begged me for another bowl full. &#8216;Be so<br />
kind,&#8217; he said, &#8216;as to give me some more, and tell me your name at<br />
once. I want to make you a present that you will be glad to have. We<br />
have wine even in this country, for our soil grows grapes and the<br />
sun ripens them, but this drinks like nectar and ambrosia all in one.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him,<br />
and three times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, when<br />
I saw that the wine had got into his head, I said to him as<br />
plausibly as I could: &#8216;Cyclops, you ask my name and I will tell it<br />
you; give me, therefore, the present you promised me; my name is<br />
Noman; this is what my father and mother and my friends have always<br />
called me.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;But the cruel wretch said, &#8216;Then I will eat all Noman&#8217;s comrades<br />
before Noman himself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is the<br />
present that I will make him.&#8217;<br />
As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the<br />
ground. His great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took<br />
hold upon him. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and<br />
the gobbets of human flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was<br />
very drunk. Then I thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat<br />
it, and encouraged my men lest any of them should turn<br />
faint-hearted. When the wood, green though it was, was about to blaze,<br />
I drew it out of the fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round<br />
me, for heaven had filled their hearts with courage. We drove the<br />
sharp end of the beam into the monster&#8217;s eye, and bearing upon it with<br />
all my weight I kept turning it round and round as though I were<br />
boring a hole in a ship&#8217;s plank with an auger, which two men with a<br />
wheel and strap can keep on turning as long as they choose. Even<br />
thus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye, till the boiling blood<br />
bubbled all over it as we worked it round and round, so that the steam<br />
from the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the<br />
roots of the eye sputtered in the fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe<br />
or hatchet into cold water to temper it- for it is this that gives<br />
strength to the iron- and it makes a great hiss as he does so, even<br />
thus did the Cyclops&#8217; eye hiss round the beam of olive wood, and his<br />
hideous yells made the cave ring again. We ran away in a fright, but<br />
he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his eye, and<br />
hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did so<br />
to the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him; so<br />
they gathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard him<br />
crying, and asked what was the matter with him.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;What ails you, Polyphemus,&#8217; said they, &#8216;that you make such a<br />
noise, breaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from<br />
being able to sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep?<br />
Surely no man is trying to kill you either by fraud or by force?<br />
&#8220;But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, &#8216;Noman is<br />
killing me by fraud! Noman is killing me by force!&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Then,&#8217; said they, &#8216;if no man is attacking you, you must be ill;<br />
when Jove makes people ill, there is no help for it, and you had<br />
better pray to your father Neptune.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my<br />
clever stratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain,<br />
felt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from the<br />
door; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of<br />
it to catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might be<br />
foolish enough to attempt this.<br />
&#8220;As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save<br />
my own life and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as<br />
one who knows that his life depends upon it, for the danger was very<br />
great. In the end I deemed that this plan would be the best. The<br />
male sheep were well grown, and carried a heavy black fleece, so I<br />
bound them noiselessly in threes together, with some of the withies on<br />
which the wicked monster used to sleep. There was to be a man under<br />
the middle sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, so<br />
that there were three sheep to each man. As for myself there was a ram<br />
finer than any of the others, so I caught hold of him by the back,<br />
esconced myself in the thick wool under his belly, and flung on<br />
patiently to his fleece, face upwards, keeping a firm hold on it all<br />
the time.<br />
&#8220;Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came,<br />
but when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the<br />
male sheep hurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating about<br />
the pens waiting to be milked, for their udders were full to bursting;<br />
but their master in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the<br />
sheep as they stood upright, without being sharp enough to find out<br />
that the men were underneath their bellies. As the ram was going<br />
out, last of all, heavy with its fleece and with the weight of my<br />
crafty self; Polyphemus laid hold of it and said:<br />
&#8220;&#8216;My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave<br />
this morning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but lead<br />
the mob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and<br />
are the first to come home again at night; but now you lag last of<br />
all. Is it because you know your master has lost his eye, and are<br />
sorry because that wicked Noman and his horrid crew have got him<br />
down in his drink and blinded him? But I will have his life yet. If<br />
you could understand and talk, you would tell me where the wretch is<br />
hiding, and I would dash his brains upon the ground till they flew all<br />
over the cave. I should thus have some satisfaction for the harm a<br />
this no-good Noman has done me.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;As spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way<br />
out from the cave and yards, I first got from under the ram&#8217;s belly,<br />
and then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat,<br />
by constantly heading them in the right direction we managed to<br />
drive them down to the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those<br />
of us who had escaped death, but wept for the others whom the<br />
Cyclops had killed. However, I made signs to them by nodding and<br />
frowning that they were to hush their crying, and told them to get all<br />
the sheep on board at once and put out to sea; so they went aboard,<br />
took their places, and smote the grey sea with their oars. Then,<br />
when I had got as far out as my voice would reach, I began to jeer<br />
at the Cyclops.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Cyclops,&#8217; said I, &#8216;you should have taken better measure of your<br />
man before eating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up<br />
your visitors in your own house? You might have known that your sin<br />
would find you out, and now Jove and the other gods have punished<br />
you.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the top<br />
from off a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship so<br />
that it was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder. The<br />
sea quaked as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it<br />
raised carried us back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the<br />
shore. But I snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, making<br />
signs to my men by nodding my head, that they must row for their<br />
lives, whereon they laid out with a will. When we had got twice as far<br />
as we were before, I was for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men<br />
begged and prayed of me to hold my tongue.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Do not,&#8217; they exclaimed, &#8216;be mad enough to provoke this savage<br />
creature further; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove<br />
us back again to the mainland, and we made sure it had been the<br />
death of us; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would<br />
have pounded our heads and our ship&#8217;s timbers into a jelly with the<br />
rugged rocks he would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a<br />
long way.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;But I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in my<br />
rage, &#8216;Cyclops, if any one asks you who it was that put your eye out<br />
and spoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son<br />
of Laertes, who lives in Ithaca.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;On this he groaned, and cried out, &#8216;Alas, alas, then the old<br />
prophecy about me is coming true. There was a prophet here, at one<br />
time, a man both brave and of great stature, Telemus son of Eurymus,<br />
who was an excellent seer, and did all the prophesying for the<br />
Cyclopes till he grew old; he told me that all this would happen to me<br />
some day, and said I should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses. I<br />
have been all along expecting some one of imposing presence and<br />
superhuman strength, whereas he turns out to be a little insignificant<br />
weakling, who has managed to blind my eye by taking advantage of me in<br />
my drink; come here, then, Ulysses, that I may make you presents to<br />
show my hospitality, and urge Neptune to help you forward on your<br />
journey- for Neptune and I are father and son. He, if he so will,<br />
shall heal me, which no one else neither god nor man can do.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Then I said, &#8216;I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and<br />
sending you down to the house of Hades, as I am that it will take more<br />
than Neptune to cure that eye of yours.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;On this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and<br />
prayed, saying, &#8216;Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your own<br />
true-begotten son, grant that Ulysses may never reach his home<br />
alive; or if he must get back to his friends at last, let him do so<br />
late and in sore plight after losing all his men [let him reach his<br />
home in another man's ship and find trouble in his house.']<br />
&#8220;Thus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked up a<br />
rock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with<br />
prodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within a<br />
little of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock<br />
fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on<br />
our way towards the shore of the island.<br />
&#8220;When at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our<br />
ships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting<br />
our return. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on<br />
to the sea shore; we also landed the Cyclops&#8217; sheep, and divided<br />
them equitably amongst us so that none might have reason to<br />
complain. As for the ram, my companions agreed that I should have it<br />
as an extra share; so I sacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its<br />
thigh bones to Jove, who is the lord of all. But he heeded not my<br />
sacrifice, and only thought how he might destroy my ships and my<br />
comrades.<br />
&#8220;Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we<br />
feasted our fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down and<br />
it came on dark, we camped upon the beach. When the child of<br />
morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I bade my men on board and<br />
loose the hawsers. Then they took their places and smote the grey<br />
sea with their oars; so we sailed on with sorrow in our hearts, but<br />
glad to have escaped death though we had lost our comrades.</p>
<p>
BOOK X</p>
<p>THENCE we went on to the Aeoli island where lives Aeolus son of<br />
Hippotas, dear to the immortal gods. It is an island that floats (as<br />
it were) upon the sea, iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now,<br />
Aeolus has six daughters and six lusty sons, so he made the sons marry<br />
the daughters, and they all live with their dear father and mother,<br />
feasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long<br />
the atmosphere of the house is loaded with the savour of roasting<br />
meats till it groans again, yard and all; but by night they sleep on<br />
their well-made bedsteads, each with his own wife between the<br />
blankets. These were the people among whom we had now come.<br />
&#8220;Aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all the<br />
time about Troy, the Argive fleet, and the return of the Achaeans. I<br />
told him exactly how everything had happened, and when I said I must<br />
go, and asked him to further me on my way, he made no sort of<br />
difficulty, but set about doing so at once. Moreover, he flayed me a<br />
prime ox-hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut<br />
up in the hide as in a sack- for Jove had made him captain over the<br />
winds, and he could stir or still each one of them according to his<br />
own pleasure. He put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth so<br />
tightly with a silver thread that not even a breath of a side-wind<br />
could blow from any quarter. The West wind which was fair for us did<br />
he alone let blow as it chose; but it all came to nothing, for we were<br />
lost through our own folly.<br />
&#8220;Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day our<br />
native land showed on the horizon. We got so close in that we could<br />
see the stubble fires burning, and I, being then dead beat, fell<br />
into a light sleep, for I had never let the rudder out of my own<br />
hands, that we might get home the faster. On this the men fell to<br />
talking among themselves, and said I was bringing back gold and silver<br />
in the sack that Aeolus had given me. &#8216;Bless my heart,&#8217; would one turn<br />
to his neighbour, saying, &#8216;how this man gets honoured and makes<br />
friends to whatever city or country he may go. See what fine prizes he<br />
is taking home from Troy, while we, who have travelled just as far<br />
as he has, come back with hands as empty as we set out with- and now<br />
Aeolus has given him ever so much more. Quick- let us see what it<br />
all is, and how much gold and silver there is in the sack he gave<br />
him.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack,<br />
whereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that<br />
carried us weeping out to sea and away from our own country. Then I<br />
awoke, and knew not whether to throw myself into the sea or to live on<br />
and make the best of it; but I bore it, covered myself up, and lay<br />
down in the ship, while the men lamented bitterly as the fierce<br />
winds bore our fleet back to the Aeolian island.<br />
&#8220;When we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dined<br />
hard by the ships. Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one of<br />
my men and went straight to the house of Aeolus, where I found him<br />
feasting with his wife and family; so we sat down as suppliants on the<br />
threshold. They were astounded when they saw us and said, &#8216;Ulysses,<br />
what brings you here? What god has been ill-treating you? We took<br />
great pains to further you on your way home to Ithaca, or wherever<br />
it was that you wanted to go to.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Thus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, &#8216;My men have<br />
undone me; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined me. My friends, mend<br />
me this mischief, for you can if you will.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;I spoke as movingly as I could, but they said nothing, till their<br />
father answered, &#8216;Vilest of mankind, get you gone at once out of the<br />
island; him whom heaven hates will I in no wise help. Be off, for<br />
you come here as one abhorred of heaven. &#8220;And with these words he sent<br />
me sorrowing from his door.<br />
&#8220;Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long<br />
and fruitless rowing, for there was no longer any wind to help them.<br />
Six days, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reached<br />
the rocky stronghold of Lamus- Telepylus, the city of the<br />
Laestrygonians, where the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and<br />
goats [to be milked] salutes him who is driving out his flock [to<br />
feed] and this last answers the salute. In that country a man who<br />
could do without sleep might earn double wages, one as a herdsman of<br />
cattle, and another as a shepherd, for they work much the same by<br />
night as they do by day.<br />
&#8220;When we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steep<br />
cliffs, with a narrow entrance between two headlands. My captains took<br />
all their ships inside, and made them fast close to one another, for<br />
there was never so much as a breath of wind inside, but it was<br />
always dead calm. I kept my own ship outside, and moored it to a<br />
rock at the very end of the point; then I climbed a high rock to<br />
reconnoitre, but could see no sign neither of man nor cattle, only<br />
some smoke rising from the ground. So I sent two of my company with an<br />
attendant to find out what sort of people the inhabitants were.<br />
&#8220;The men when they got on shore followed a level road by which the<br />
people draw their firewood from the mountains into the town, till<br />
presently they met a young woman who had come outside to fetch<br />
water, and who was daughter to a Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She<br />
was going to the fountain Artacia from which the people bring in their<br />
water, and when my men had come close up to her, they asked her who<br />
the king of that country might be, and over what kind of people he<br />
ruled; so she directed them to her father&#8217;s house, but when they got<br />
there they found his wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain,<br />
and they were horrified at the sight of her.<br />
&#8220;She at once called her husband Antiphates from the place of<br />
assembly, and forthwith he set about killing my men. He snatched up<br />
one of them, and began to make his dinner off him then and there,<br />
whereon the other two ran back to the ships as fast as ever they<br />
could. But Antiphates raised a hue and cry after them, and thousands<br />
of sturdy Laestrygonians sprang up from every quarter- ogres, not men.<br />
They threw vast rocks at us from the cliffs as though they had been<br />
mere stones, and I heard the horrid sound of the ships crunching up<br />
against one another, and the death cries of my men, as the<br />
Laestrygonians speared them like fishes and took them home to eat<br />
them. While they were thus killing my men within the harbour I drew my<br />
sword, cut the cable of my own ship, and told my men to row with alf<br />
their might if they too would not fare like the rest; so they laid out<br />
for their lives, and we were thankful enough when we got into open<br />
water out of reach of the rocks they hurled at us. As for the others<br />
there was not one of them left.<br />
&#8220;Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped death, though we<br />
had lost our comrades, and came to the Aeaean island, where Circe<br />
lives a great and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magician<br />
Aeetes- for they are both children of the sun by Perse, who is<br />
daughter to Oceanus. We brought our ship into a safe harbour without a<br />
word, for some god guided us thither, and having landed we there for<br />
two days and two nights, worn out in body and mind. When the morning<br />
of the third day came I took my spear and my sword, and went away from<br />
the ship to reconnoitre, and see if I could discover signs of human<br />
handiwork, or hear the sound of voices. Climbing to the top of a<br />
high look-out I espied the smoke of Circe&#8217;s house rising upwards<br />
amid a dense forest of trees, and when I saw this I doubted whether,<br />
having seen the smoke, I would not go on at once and find out more,<br />
but in the end I deemed it best to go back to the ship, give the men<br />
their dinners, and send some of them instead of going myself.<br />
&#8220;When I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon my<br />
solitude, and sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of my<br />
path. He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the<br />
river, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struck<br />
him in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went<br />
clean through him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life went<br />
out of him. Then I set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the wound,<br />
and laid it down; I also gathered rough grass and rushes and twisted<br />
them into a fathom or so of good stout rope, with which I bound the<br />
four feet of the noble creature together; having so done I hung him<br />
round my neck and walked back to the ship leaning upon my spear, for<br />
the stag was much too big for me to be able to carry him on my<br />
shoulder, steadying him with one hand. As I threw him down in front of<br />
the ship, I called the men and spoke cheeringly man by man to each<br />
of them. &#8216;Look here my friends,&#8217; said I, &#8216;we are not going to die so<br />
much before our time after all, and at any rate we will not starve<br />
so long as we have got something to eat and drink on board.&#8217; On this<br />
they uncovered their heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag,<br />
for he was indeed a splendid fellow. Then, when they had feasted their<br />
eyes upon him sufficiently, they washed their hands and began to<br />
cook him for dinner.<br />
&#8220;Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we<br />
stayed there eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun went<br />
down and it came on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the child<br />
of morning, fingered Dawn, appeared, I called a council and said,<br />
&#8216;My friends, we are in very great difficulties; listen therefore to<br />
me. We have no idea where the sun either sets or rises, so that we<br />
do not even know East from West. I see no way out of it; nevertheless,<br />
we must try and find one. We are certainly on an island, for I went as<br />
high as I could this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it to<br />
the horizon; it lies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke rising<br />
from out of a thick forest of trees.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Their hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they<br />
had been treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savage<br />
ogre Polyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was<br />
nothing to be got by crying, so I divided them into two companies<br />
and set a captain over each; I gave one company to Eurylochus, while I<br />
took command of the other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet, and<br />
the lot fell upon Eurylochus; so he set out with his twenty-two men,<br />
and they wept, as also did we who were left behind.<br />
&#8220;When they reached Circe&#8217;s house they found it built of cut<br />
stones, on a site that could be seen from far, in the middle of the<br />
forest. There were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round<br />
it- poor bewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments<br />
and drugged into subjection. They did not attack my men, but wagged<br />
their great tails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovingly<br />
against them. As hounds crowd round their master when they see him<br />
coming from dinner- for they know he will bring them something- even<br />
so did these wolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon my men,<br />
but the men were terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures.<br />
Presently they reached the gates of the goddess&#8217;s house, and as they<br />
stood there they could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully<br />
as she worked at her loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of<br />
such dazzling colours as no one but a goddess could weave. On this<br />
Polites, whom I valued and trusted more than any other of my men,<br />
said, &#8216;There is some one inside working at a loom and singing most<br />
beautifully; the whole place resounds with it, let us call her and see<br />
whether she is woman or goddess.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade<br />
them enter. They, thinking no evil, followed her, all except<br />
Eurylochus, who suspected mischief and stayed outside. When she had<br />
got them into her house, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed<br />
them a mess with cheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian but she drugged<br />
it with wicked poisons to make them forget their homes, and when<br />
they had drunk she turned them into pigs by a stroke of her wand,<br />
and shut them up in her pigsties. They were like pigs-head, hair,<br />
and all, and they grunted just as pigs do; but their senses were the<br />
same as before, and they remembered everything.<br />
&#8220;Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some<br />
acorns and beech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried back<br />
to tell me about the sad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome with<br />
dismay that though he tried to speak he could find no words to do<br />
so; his eyes filled with tears and he could only sob and sigh, till at<br />
last we forced his story out of him, and he told us what had<br />
happened to the others.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;We went,&#8217; said he, as you told us, through the forest, and in<br />
the middle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a<br />
place that could be seen from far. There we found a woman, or else she<br />
was a goddess, working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the men<br />
shouted to her and called her, whereon she at once came down, opened<br />
the door, and invited us in. The others did not suspect any mischief<br />
so they followed her into the house, but I stayed where I was, for I<br />
thought there might be some treachery. From that moment I saw them<br />
no more, for not one of them ever came out, though I sat a long time<br />
watching for them.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I<br />
also took my bow, and told Eurylochus to come back with me and show me<br />
the way. But he laid hold of me with both his hands and spoke<br />
piteously, saying, &#8216;Sir, do not force me to go with you, but let me<br />
stay here, for I know you will not bring one of them back with you,<br />
nor even return alive yourself; let us rather see if we cannot<br />
escape at any rate with the few that are left us, for we may still<br />
save our lives.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Stay where you are, then, &#8216;answered I, &#8216;eating and drinking at the<br />
ship, but I must go, for I am most urgently bound to do so.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;With this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through<br />
the charmed grove, and was near the great house of the enchantress<br />
Circe, I met Mercury with his golden wand, disguised as a young man in<br />
the hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his<br />
face. He came up to me and took my hand within his own, saying, &#8216;My<br />
poor unhappy man, whither are you going over this mountain top,<br />
alone and without knowing the way? Your men are shut up in Circe&#8217;s<br />
pigsties, like so many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not<br />
fancy that you can set them free? I can tell you that you will never<br />
get back and will have to stay there with the rest of them. But<br />
never mind, I will protect you and get you out of your difficulty.<br />
Take this herb, which is one of great virtue, and keep it about you<br />
when you go to Circe&#8217;s house, it will be a talisman to you against<br />
every kind of mischief.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will<br />
try to practise upon you. She will mix a mess for you to drink, and<br />
she will drug the meal with which she makes it, but she will not be<br />
able to charm you, for the virtue of the herb that I shall give you<br />
will prevent her spells from working. I will tell you all about it.<br />
When Circe strikes you with her wand, draw your sword and spring<br />
upon her as though you were goings to kill her. She will then be<br />
frightened and will desire you to go to bed with her; on this you must<br />
not point blank refuse her, for you want her to set your companions<br />
free, and to take good care also of yourself, but you make her swear<br />
solemnly by all the blessed that she will plot no further mischief<br />
against you, or else when she has got you naked she will unman you and<br />
make you fit for nothing.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground an showed me<br />
what it was like. The root was black, while the flower was as white as<br />
milk; the gods call it Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but<br />
the gods can do whatever they like.<br />
&#8220;Then Mercury went back to high Olympus passing over the wooded<br />
island; but I fared onward to the house of Circe, and my heart was<br />
clouded with care as I walked along. When I got to the gates I stood<br />
there and called the goddess, and as soon as she heard me she came<br />
down, opened the door, and asked me to come in; so I followed her-<br />
much troubled in my mind. She set me on a richly decorated seat inlaid<br />
with silver, there was a footstool also under my feet, and she mixed a<br />
mess in a golden goblet for me to drink; but she drugged it, for she<br />
meant me mischief. When she had given it me, and I had drunk it<br />
without its charming me, she struck she, struck me with her wand.<br />
&#8216;There now,&#8217; she cried, &#8216;be off to the pigsty, and make your lair with<br />
the rest of them.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her,<br />
whereon she fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke<br />
piteously, saying, &#8216;Who and whence are you? from what place and people<br />
have you come? How can it be that my drugs have no power to charm you?<br />
Never yet was any man able to stand so much as a taste of the herb I<br />
gave you; you must be spell-proof; surely you can be none other than<br />
the bold hero Ulysses, who Mercury always said would come here some<br />
day with his ship while on his way home form Troy; so be it then;<br />
sheathe your sword and let us go to bed, that we may make friends<br />
and learn to trust each other.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;And I answered, &#8216;Circe, how can you expect me to be friendly with<br />
you when you have just been turning all my men into pigs? And now that<br />
you have got me here myself, you mean me mischief when you ask me to<br />
go to bed with you, and will unman me and make me fit for nothing. I<br />
shall certainly not consent to go to bed with you unless you will<br />
first take your solemn oath to plot no further harm against me.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;So she swore at once as I had told her, and when she had<br />
completed her oath then I went to bed with her.<br />
&#8220;Meanwhile her four servants, who are her housemaids, set about<br />
their work. They are the children of the groves and fountains, and<br />
of the holy waters that run down into the sea. One of them spread a<br />
fair purple cloth over a seat, and laid a carpet underneath it.<br />
Another brought tables of silver up to the seats, and set them with<br />
baskets of gold. A third mixed some sweet wine with water in a<br />
silver bowl and put golden cups upon the tables, while the fourth<br />
she brought in water and set it to boil in a large cauldron over a<br />
good fire which she had lighted. When the water in the cauldron was<br />
boiling, she poured cold into it till it was just as I liked it, and<br />
then she set me in a bath and began washing me from the cauldron about<br />
the head and shoulders, to take the tire and stiffness out of my<br />
limbs. As soon as she had done washing me and anointing me with oil,<br />
she arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt and led me to a richly<br />
decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under my<br />
feet. A maid servant then brought me water in a beautiful golden<br />
ewer and poured it into a silver basin for me to wash my hands, and<br />
she drew a clean table beside me; an upper servant brought me bread<br />
and offered me many things of what there was in the house, and then<br />
Circe bade me eat, but I would not, and sat without heeding what was<br />
before me, still moody and suspicious.<br />
&#8220;When Circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief,<br />
she came to me and said, &#8216;Ulysses, why do you sit like that as<br />
though you were dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing both<br />
meat and drink? Is it that you are still suspicious? You ought not<br />
to be, for I have already sworn solemnly that I will not hurt you.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;And I said, &#8216;Circe, no man with any sense of what is right can<br />
think of either eating or drinking in your house until you have set<br />
his friends free and let him see them. If you want me to eat and<br />
drink, you must free my men and bring them to me that I may see them<br />
with my own eyes.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;When I had said this she went straight through the court with her<br />
wand in her hand and opened the pigsty doors. My men came out like<br />
so many prime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went about<br />
among them and anointed each with a second drug, whereon the<br />
bristles that the bad drug had given them fell off, and they became<br />
men again, younger than they were before, and much taller and better<br />
looking. They knew me at once, seized me each of them by the hand, and<br />
wept for joy till the whole house was filled with the sound of their<br />
hullabalooing, and Circe herself was so sorry for them that she came<br />
up to me and said, &#8216;Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, go back at once<br />
to the sea where you have left your ship, and first draw it on to<br />
the land. Then, hide all your ship&#8217;s gear and property in some cave,<br />
and come back here with your men.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;I agreed to this, so I went back to the sea shore, and found the<br />
men at the ship weeping and wailing most piteously. When they saw me<br />
the silly blubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves break<br />
out and gambol round their mothers, when they see them coming home<br />
to be milked after they have been feeding all day, and the homestead<br />
resounds with their lowing. They seemed as glad to see me as though<br />
they had got back to their own rugged Ithaca, where they had been born<br />
and bred. &#8216;Sir,&#8217; said the affectionate creatures, &#8216;we are as glad to<br />
see you back as though we had got safe home to Ithaca; but tell us all<br />
about the fate of our comrades.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;I spoke comfortingly to them and said, &#8216;We must draw our ship on to<br />
the land, and hide the ship&#8217;s gear with all our property in some cave;<br />
then come with me all of you as fast as you can to Circe&#8217;s house,<br />
where you will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst<br />
of great abundance.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;On this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylochus<br />
tried to hold them back and said, &#8216;Alas, poor wretches that we are,<br />
what will become of us? Rush not on your ruin by going to the house of<br />
Circe, who will turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall<br />
have to keep guard over her house. Remember how the Cyclops treated us<br />
when our comrades went inside his cave, and Ulysses with them. It<br />
was all through his sheer folly that those men lost their lives.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;When I heard him I was in two minds whether or no to draw the<br />
keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in<br />
spite of his being a near relation of my own; but the men interceded<br />
for him and said, &#8216;Sir, if it may so be, let this fellow stay here and<br />
mind the ship, but take the rest of us with you to Circe&#8217;s house.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;On this we all went inland, and Eurylochus was not left behind<br />
after all, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severe<br />
reprimand that I had given him.<br />
&#8220;Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men who had been left<br />
behind were washed and anointed with olive oil; she had also given<br />
them woollen cloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all<br />
comfortably at dinner in her house. As soon as the men saw each<br />
other face to face and knew one another, they wept for joy and cried<br />
aloud till the whole palace rang again. Thereon Circe came up to me<br />
and said, &#8216;Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, tell your men to leave off<br />
crying; I know how much you have all of you suffered at sea, and how<br />
ill you have fared among cruel savages on the mainland, but that is<br />
over now, so stay here, and eat and drink till you are once more as<br />
strong and hearty as you were when you left Ithaca; for at present you<br />
are weakened both in body and mind; you keep all the time thinking<br />
of the hardships- you have suffered during your travels, so that you<br />
have no more cheerfulness left in you.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for a<br />
whole twelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and<br />
wine. But when the year had passed in the waning of moons and the long<br />
days had come round, my men called me apart and said, &#8216;Sir, it is time<br />
you began to think about going home, if so be you are to be spared<br />
to see your house and native country at all.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong<br />
day to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine,<br />
but when the sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselves<br />
down to sleep in the covered cloisters. I, however, after I had got<br />
into bed with Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess<br />
listened to what I had got to say. &#8216;Circe,&#8217; said I, &#8216;please to keep<br />
the promise you made me about furthering me on my homeward voyage. I<br />
want to get back and so do my men, they are always pestering me with<br />
their complaints as soon as ever your back is turned.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;And the goddess answered, &#8216;Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall<br />
none of you stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there is<br />
another journey which you have got to take before you can sail<br />
homewards. You must go to the house of Hades and of dread Proserpine<br />
to consult the ghost of the blind Theban prophet Teiresias whose<br />
reason is still unshaken. To him alone has Proserpine left his<br />
understanding even in death, but the other ghosts flit about<br />
aimlessly.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, and<br />
would gladly have lived no longer to see the light of the sun, but<br />
presently when I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, I<br />
said, &#8216;And who shall guide me upon this voyage- for the house of Hades<br />
is a port that no ship can reach.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;You will want no guide,&#8217; she answered; &#8216;raise you mast, set your<br />
white sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there<br />
of itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you<br />
will reach the fertile shore of Proserpine&#8217;s country with its groves<br />
of tall poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach<br />
your ship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go straight on to the dark<br />
abode of Hades. You will find it near the place where the rivers<br />
Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx)<br />
flow into Acheron, and you will see a rock near it, just where the two<br />
roaring rivers run into one another.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench a<br />
cubit or so in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a<br />
drink-offering to all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then<br />
wine, and in the third place water-sprinkling white barley meal over<br />
the whole. Moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feeble<br />
ghosts, and promise them that when you get back to Ithaca you will<br />
sacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you have, and will load<br />
the pyre with good things. More particularly you must promise that<br />
Teiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself, the finest in all<br />
your flocks.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers,<br />
offer them a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards<br />
Erebus; but yourself turn away from them as though you would make<br />
towards the river. On this, many dead men&#8217;s ghosts will come to you,<br />
and you must tell your men to skin the two sheep that you have just<br />
killed, and offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades<br />
and to Proserpine. Then draw your sword and sit there, so as to<br />
prevent any other poor ghost from coming near the split blood before<br />
Teiresias shall have answered your questions. The seer will<br />
presently come to you, and will tell you about your voyage- what<br />
stages you are to make, and how you are to sail the see so as to reach<br />
your home.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;It was day-break by the time she had done speaking, so she<br />
dressed me in my shirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful<br />
light gossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a golden<br />
girdle round her waist, and she covered her head with a mantle. Then I<br />
went about among the men everywhere all over the house, and spoke<br />
kindly to each of them man by man: &#8216;You must not lie sleeping here any<br />
longer,&#8217; said I to them, &#8216;we must be going, for Circe has told me<br />
all about it.&#8217; And this they did as I bade them.<br />
&#8220;Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure.<br />
We had with us a certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable<br />
for sense or courage, who had got drunk and was lying on the house-top<br />
away from the rest of the men, to sleep off his liquor in the cool.<br />
When he heard the noise of the men bustling about, he jumped up on a<br />
sudden and forgot all about coming down by the main staircase, so he<br />
tumbled right off the roof and broke his neck, and his soul went<br />
down to the house of Hades.<br />
&#8220;When I had got the men together I said to them, &#8216;You think you<br />
are about to start home again, but Circe has explained to me that<br />
instead of this, we have got to go to the house of Hades and<br />
Proserpine to consult the ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;The men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw<br />
themselves on the ground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did<br />
not mend matters by crying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and<br />
lamenting our fate, Circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we made<br />
them fast hard by the ship. She passed through the midst of us without<br />
our knowing it, for who can see the comings and goings of a god, if<br />
the god does not wish to be seen?</p>
