				<p>BOOK XXI</p>
<p>MINERVA now put it in Penelope&#8217;s mind to make the suitors try<br />
their skill with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest among<br />
themselves, as a means of bringing about their destruction. She went<br />
upstairs and got the store room key, which was made of bronze and<br />
had a handle of ivory; she then went with her maidens into the store<br />
room at the end of the house, where her husband&#8217;s treasures of gold,<br />
bronze, and wrought iron were kept, and where was also his bow, and<br />
the quiver full of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend<br />
whom he had met in Lacedaemon- Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The two<br />
fell in with one another in Messene at the house of Ortilochus,<br />
where Ulysses was staying in order to recover a debt that was owing<br />
from the whole people; for the Messenians had carried off three<br />
hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had sailed away with them and with<br />
their shepherds. In quest of these Ulysses took a long journey while<br />
still quite young, for his father and the other chieftains sent him on<br />
a mission to recover them. Iphitus had gone there also to try and<br />
get back twelve brood mares that he had lost, and the mule foals<br />
that were running with them. These mares were the death of him in<br />
the end, for when he went to the house of Jove&#8217;s son, mighty Hercules,<br />
who performed such prodigies of valour, Hercules to his shame killed<br />
him, though he was his guest, for he feared not heaven&#8217;s vengeance,<br />
nor yet respected his own table which he had set before Iphitus, but<br />
killed him in spite of everything, and kept the mares himself. It<br />
was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and gave him the bow<br />
which mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which on his death<br />
had been left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in return a sword<br />
and a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast friendship, although<br />
they never visited at one another&#8217;s houses, for Jove&#8217;s son Hercules<br />
killed Iphitus ere they could do so. This bow, then, given him by<br />
Iphitus, had not been taken with him by Ulysses when he sailed for<br />
Troy; he had used it so long as he had been at home, but had left it<br />
behind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.<br />
Penelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store room;<br />
the carpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so as<br />
to get it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and<br />
hung the doors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door,<br />
put in the key, and drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts<br />
that held the doors; these flew open with a noise like a bull<br />
bellowing in a meadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raised<br />
platform, where the chests stood in which the fair linen and clothes<br />
were laid by along with fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down<br />
the bow with its bow case from the peg on which it hung. She sat<br />
down with it on her knees, weeping bitterly as she took the bow out of<br />
its case, and when her tears had relieved her, she went to the<br />
cloister where the suitors were, carrying the bow and the quiver, with<br />
the many deadly arrows that were inside it. Along with her came her<br />
maidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron and bronze which her<br />
husband had won as prizes. When she reached the suitors, she stood<br />
by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,<br />
holding a veil before her face, and with a maid on either side of her.<br />
Then she said:<br />
&#8220;Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality of<br />
this house because its owner has been long absent, and without other<br />
pretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the prize<br />
that you are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow of<br />
Ulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send<br />
his arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I follow and<br />
quit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding in<br />
wealth. But even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in my<br />
dreams.&#8221;<br />
As she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron<br />
before the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she<br />
had bidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw his<br />
master&#8217;s bow, but Antinous scolded them. &#8220;You country louts,&#8221; said he,<br />
&#8220;silly simpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of your<br />
mistress by crying in this way? She has enough to grieve her in the<br />
loss of her husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in<br />
silence, or go outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behind<br />
you. We suitors shall have to contend for it with might and main,<br />
for we shall find it no light matter to string such a bow as this<br />
is. There is not a man of us all who is such another as Ulysses; for I<br />
have seen him and remember him, though I was then only a child.&#8221;<br />
This was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be<br />
able to string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact<br />
he was to be the first that should taste of the arrows from the<br />
hands of Ulysses, whom he was dishonouring in his own house- egging<br />
the others on to do so also.<br />
Then Telemachus spoke. &#8220;Great heavens!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;Jove must<br />
have robbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother<br />
saying she will quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and<br />
enjoying myself as though there were nothing happening. But,<br />
suitors, as the contest has been agreed upon, let it go forward. It is<br />
for a woman whose peer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos, or<br />
Mycene, nor yet in Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as well<br />
as I do; what need have I to speak in praise of my mother? Come on,<br />
then, make no excuses for delay, but let us see whether you can string<br />
the bow or no. I too will make trial of it, for if I can string it and<br />
shoot through the iron, I shall not suffer my mother to quit this<br />
house with a stranger, not if I can win the prizes which my father won<br />
before me.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from<br />
him, and took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in<br />
a row, in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had Wade<br />
straight by line. Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and<br />
everyone was surprised when they saw him set up so orderly, though<br />
he had never seen anything of the kind before. This done, he went on<br />
to the pavement to make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it,<br />
trying with all his might to draw the string, and thrice he had to<br />
leave off, though he had hoped to string the bow and shoot through the<br />
iron. He was trying for the fourth time, and would have strung it<br />
had not Ulysses made a sign to check him in spite of all his<br />
eagerness. So he said:<br />
&#8220;Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I am<br />
too young, and have not yet reached my full strength so as to be<br />
able to hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore,<br />
who are stronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest<br />
settled.&#8221;<br />
On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door<br />
[that led into the house] with the arrow standing against the top of<br />
the bow. Then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and<br />
Antinous said:<br />
&#8220;Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the<br />
place at which the. cupbearer begins when he is handing round the<br />
wine.&#8221;<br />
The rest agreed, and Leiodes son of OEnops was the first to rise. He<br />
was sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner near<br />
the mixing-bowl. He was the only man who hated their evil deeds and<br />
was indignant with the others. He was now the first to take the bow<br />
and arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he<br />
could not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard<br />
work, they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors,<br />
&#8220;My friends, I cannot string it; let another have it; this bow shall<br />
take the life and soul out of many a chief among us, for it is<br />
better to die than to live after having missed the prize that we<br />
have so long striven for, and which has brought us so long together.<br />
Some one of us is even now hoping and praying that he may marry<br />
Penelope, but when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him woo<br />
and make bridal offerings to some other woman, and let Penelope<br />
marry whoever makes her the best offer and whose lot it is to win<br />
her.&#8221;<br />
On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door,<br />
with the arrow standing against the tip of the bow. Then he took his<br />
seat again on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked<br />
him saying:<br />
&#8220;Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and<br />
intolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this bow<br />
take the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend<br />
it yourself? True, you were not born to be an archer, but there are<br />
others who will soon string it.&#8221;<br />
Then he said to Melanthius the goatherd, &#8220;Look sharp, light a fire<br />
in the court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us<br />
also a large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us<br />
warm the bow and grease it we will then make trial of it again, and<br />
bring the contest to an end.&#8221;<br />
Melanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins<br />
beside it. He also brought a great ball of lard from what they had<br />
in the house, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of<br />
it, but they were none of them nearly strong enough to string it.<br />
Nevertheless there still remained Antinous and Eurymachus, who were<br />
the ringleaders among the suitors and much the foremost among them<br />
all.<br />
Then the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and<br />
Ulysses followed them. When they had got outside the gates and the<br />
outer yard, Ulysses said to them quietly:<br />
&#8220;Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am<br />
in doubt whether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What<br />
manner of men would you be to stand by Ulysses, if some god should<br />
bring him back here all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to do-<br />
to side with the suitors, or with Ulysses?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Father Jove,&#8221; answered the stockman, &#8220;would indeed that you might<br />
so ordain it. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you should<br />
see with what might and main I would fight for him.&#8221;<br />
In like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might<br />
return; when, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of,<br />
Ulysses said, &#8220;It is I, Ulysses, who am here. I have suffered much,<br />
but at last, in the twentieth year, I am come back to my own<br />
country. I find that you two alone of all my servants are glad that<br />
I should do so, for I have not heard any of the others praying for<br />
my return. To you two, therefore, will I unfold the truth as it<br />
shall be. If heaven shall deliver the suitors into my hands, I will<br />
find wives for both of you, will give you house and holding close to<br />
my own, and you shall be to me as though you were brothers and friends<br />
of Telemachus. I will now give you convincing proofs that you may know<br />
me and be assured. See, here is the scar from the boar&#8217;s tooth that<br />
ripped me when I was out hunting on Mount Parnassus with the sons of<br />
Autolycus.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when<br />
they had examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses,<br />
threw their arms round him and kissed his head and shoulders, while<br />
Ulysses kissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would have<br />
gone down upon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them and<br />
said:<br />
&#8220;Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us,<br />
and tell those who a are within. When you go in, do so separately, not<br />
both together; I will go first, and do you follow afterwards; Let this<br />
moreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of them try<br />
to prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do you,<br />
therefore, Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying it<br />
about, and tell the women to close the doors of their apartment. If<br />
they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house,<br />
they must not come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they<br />
are at their work. And I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast the<br />
doors of the outer court, and to bind them securely at once.&#8221;<br />
When he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seat<br />
that he had left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside.<br />
At this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who was<br />
warming it by the fire, but even so he could not string it, and he was<br />
greatly grieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, &#8220;I grieve for<br />
myself and for us all; I grieve that I shall have to forgo the<br />
marriage, but I do not care nearly so much about this, for there are<br />
plenty of other women in Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel most is the<br />
fact of our being so inferior to Ulysses in strength that we cannot<br />
string his bow. This will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet<br />
unborn.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;It shall not be so, Eurymachus,&#8221; said Antinous, &#8220;and you know it<br />
yourself. To-day is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who<br />
can string a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side- as for the<br />
axes they can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come to the<br />
house and take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his cups,<br />
that we may make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of the<br />
bow; we will tell Melanthius to bring us in some goats to-morrow-<br />
the best he has; we can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty<br />
archer, and again make trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest to<br />
an end.&#8221;<br />
The rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water<br />
over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with<br />
wine and water and handed it round after giving every man his<br />
drink-offering. Then, when they had made their offerings and had drunk<br />
each as much as he desired, Ulysses craftily said:<br />
&#8220;Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I<br />
am minded. I appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous who<br />
has just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the present<br />
and leave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven give<br />
victory to whom it will. For the moment, however, give me the bow that<br />
I may prove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether I<br />
still have as much strength as I used to have, or whether travel and<br />
neglect have made an end of it.&#8221;<br />
This made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the<br />
bow; Antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, &#8220;Wretched<br />
creature, you have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body;<br />
you ought to think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed<br />
among your betters, without having any smaller portion served you than<br />
we others have had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation.<br />
No other beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among<br />
ourselves; the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does<br />
with all those drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the<br />
Centaur Eurytion when he was staying with Peirithous among the<br />
Lapithae. When the wine had got into his head he went mad and did<br />
ill deeds about the house of Peirithous; this angered the heroes who<br />
were there assembled, so they rushed at him and cut off his ears and<br />
nostrils; then they dragged him through the doorway out of the<br />
house, so he went away crazed, and bore the burden of his crime,<br />
bereft of understanding. Henceforth, therefore, there was war<br />
between mankind and the centaurs, but he brought it upon himself<br />
through his own drunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that it<br />
will go hardly with you if you string the bow: you will find no<br />
mercy from any one here, for we shall at once ship you off to king<br />
Echetus, who kills every one that comes near him: you will never get<br />
away alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting into a quarrel<br />
with men younger than yourself.&#8221;<br />
Penelope then spoke to him. &#8220;Antinous,&#8221; said she, &#8220;it is not right<br />
that you should ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this<br />
house. If the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty<br />
bow of Ulysses, can you suppose that he would take me home with him<br />
and make me his wife? Even the man himself can have no such idea in<br />
his mind: none of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would<br />
be out of all reason.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Queen Penelope,&#8221; answered Eurymachus, &#8220;we do not suppose that<br />
this man will take you away with him; it is impossible; but we are<br />
afraid lest some of the baser sort, men or women among the Achaeans,<br />
should go gossiping about and say, &#8216;These suitors are a feeble folk;<br />
they are paying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one<br />
of them was able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the<br />
house strung it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.&#8217; This is<br />
what will be said, and it will be a scandal against us.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Eurymachus,&#8221; Penelope answered, &#8220;people who persist in eating up<br />
the estate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not<br />
expect others to think well of them. Why then should you mind if men<br />
talk as you think they will? This stranger is strong and well-built,<br />
he says moreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and<br />
let us see whether he can string it or no. I say- and it shall<br />
surely be- that if Apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it,<br />
I will give him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep<br />
off dogs and robbers, and a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals,<br />
and will see him sent safely whereever he wants to go.&#8221;<br />
Then Telemachus said, &#8220;Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or<br />
in the islands that are over against Elis who has the right to let any<br />
one have the bow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the<br />
other, not even though I choose to make the stranger a present of<br />
the bow outright, and let him take it away with him. Go, then,<br />
within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your<br />
loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants. This bow is a<br />
man&#8217;s matter, and mine above all others, for it is I who am master<br />
here.&#8221;<br />
She went wondering back into the house, and laid her son&#8217;s saying in<br />
her heart. Then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she<br />
mourned her dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her<br />
eyelids.<br />
The swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to<br />
Ulysses, but the suitors clamoured at him from all parts of the<br />
cloisters, and one of them said, &#8220;You idiot, where are you taking<br />
the bow to? Are you out of your wits? If Apollo and the other gods<br />
will grant our prayer, your own boarhounds shall get you into some<br />
quiet little place, and worry you to death.&#8221;<br />
Eumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he put<br />
the bow down then and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him from<br />
the other side of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, &#8220;Father<br />
Eumaeus, bring the bow on in spite of them, or young as I am I will<br />
pelt you with stones back to the country, for I am the better man of<br />
the two. I wish I was as much stronger than all the other suitors in<br />
the house as I am than you, I would soon send some of them off sick<br />
and sorry, for they mean mischief.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which<br />
put them in a better humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought the<br />
bow on and placed it in the hands of Ulysses. When he had done this,<br />
he called Euryclea apart and said to her, &#8220;Euryclea, Telemachus says<br />
you are to close the doors of the women&#8217;s apartments. If they hear any<br />
groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they are not to<br />
come out, but are to keep quiet and stay where they are at their<br />
work.&#8221;<br />
Euryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women&#8217;s<br />
apartments.<br />
Meanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates<br />
of the outer court. There was a ship&#8217;s cable of byblus fibre lying<br />
in the gatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came in<br />
again, resuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on<br />
Ulysses, who had now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it<br />
every way about, and proving it all over to see whether the worms<br />
had been eating into its two horns during his absence. Then would<br />
one turn towards his neighbour saying, &#8220;This is some tricky old<br />
bow-fancier; either he has got one like it at home, or he wants to<br />
make one, in such workmanlike style does the old vagabond handle it.&#8221;<br />
Another said, &#8220;I hope he may be no more successful in other things<br />
than he is likely to be in stringing this bow.&#8221;<br />
But Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over,<br />
strung it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre<br />
and makes the twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his<br />
right hand to prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch<br />
like the twittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed, and<br />
turned colour as they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Jove<br />
thundered loudly as a sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he<br />
heard the omen that the son of scheming Saturn had sent him.<br />
He took an arrow that was lying upon the table- for those which<br />
the Achaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside the<br />
quiver- he laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew the<br />
notch of the arrow and the string toward him, still seated on his<br />
seat. When he had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every<br />
one of the handle-holes of the axes from the first onwards till it had<br />
gone right through them, and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to<br />
Telemachus:<br />
&#8220;Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what I<br />
aimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong,<br />
and not as the suitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time<br />
for the Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight,<br />
and then otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which are<br />
the crowning ornaments of a banquet.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus<br />
girded on his sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his<br />
father&#8217;s seat.</p>
<p>
BOOK XXII</p>
<p>THEN Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broad<br />
pavement with his bow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed the<br />
arrows on to the ground at his feet and said, &#8220;The mighty contest is<br />
at an end. I will now see whether Apollo will vouchsafe it to me to<br />
hit another mark which no man has yet hit.&#8221;<br />
On this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous, who was about to take<br />
up a two-handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it in<br />
his hands. He had no thought of death- who amongst all the revellers<br />
would think that one man, however brave, would stand alone among so<br />
many and kill him? The arrow struck Antinous in the throat, and the<br />
point went clean through his neck, so that he fell over and the cup<br />
dropped from his hand, while a thick stream of blood gushed from his<br />
nostrils. He kicked the table from him and upset the things on it,<br />
so that the bread and roasted meats were all soiled as they fell<br />
over on to the ground. The suitors were in an uproar when they saw<br />
that a man had been hit; they sprang in dismay one and all of them<br />
from their seats and looked everywhere towards the walls, but there<br />
was neither shield nor spear, and they rebuked Ulysses very angrily.<br />
&#8220;Stranger,&#8221; said they, &#8220;you shall pay for shooting people in this way:<br />
om yi you shall see no other contest; you are a doomed man; he whom<br />
you have slain was the foremost youth in Ithaca, and the vultures<br />
shall devour you for having killed him.&#8221;<br />
Thus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous by<br />
mistake, and did not perceive that death was hanging over the head<br />
of every one of them. But Ulysses glared at them and said:<br />
&#8220;Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You have<br />
wasted my substance, have forced my women servants to lie with you,<br />
and have wooed my wife while I was still living. You have feared<br />
neither Cod nor man, and now you shall die.&#8221;<br />
They turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round<br />
about to see whither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alone<br />
spoke.<br />
&#8220;If you are Ulysses,&#8221; said he, &#8220;then what you have said is just.<br />
We have done much wrong on your lands and in your house. But<br />
Antinous who was the head and front of the offending lies low already.<br />
It was all his doing. It was not that he wanted to marry Penelope;<br />
he did not so much care about that; what he wanted was something quite<br />
different, and Jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted to kill<br />
your son and to be chief man in Ithaca. Now, therefore, that he has<br />
met the death which was his due, spare the lives of your people. We<br />
will make everything good among ourselves, and pay you in full for all<br />
that we have eaten and drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine<br />
worth twenty oxen, and we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till<br />
your heart is softened. Until we have done this no one can complain of<br />
your being enraged against us.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses again glared at him and said, &#8220;Though you should give me all<br />
that you have in the world both now and all that you ever shall<br />
have, I will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full. You<br />
must fight, or fly for your lives; and fly, not a man of you shall.&#8221;<br />
Their hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke<br />
saying:<br />
&#8220;My friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where<br />
he is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let<br />
us then show fight; draw your swords, and hold up the tables to shield<br />
you from his arrows. Let us have at him with a rush, to drive him from<br />
the pavement and doorway: we can then get through into the town, and<br />
raise such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both<br />
sides, and with a loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulysses<br />
instantly shot an arrow into his breast that caught him by the<br />
nipple and fixed itself in his liver. He dropped his sword and fell<br />
doubled up over his table. The cup and all the meats went over on to<br />
the ground as he smote the earth with his forehead in the agonies of<br />
death, and he kicked the stool with his feet until his eyes were<br />
closed in darkness.<br />
Then Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to try<br />
and get him away from the door; but Telemachus was too quick for<br />
him, and struck him from behind; the spear caught him between the<br />
shoulders and went right through his chest, so that he fell heavily to<br />
the ground and struck the earth with his forehead. Then Telemachus<br />
sprang away from him, leaving his spear still in the body, for he<br />
feared that if he stayed to draw it out, some one of the Achaeans<br />
might come up and hack at him with his sword, or knock him down, so he<br />
set off at a run, and immediately was at his father&#8217;s side. Then he<br />
said:<br />
&#8220;Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmet<br />
for your temples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring other<br />
armour for the swineherd and the stockman, for we had better be<br />
armed.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Run and fetch them,&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;while my arrows hold out,<br />
or when I am alone they may get me away from the door.&#8221;<br />
Telemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store room<br />
where the armour was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and<br />
four brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all<br />
speed to his father, and armed himself first, while the stockman and<br />
the swineherd also put on their armour, and took their places near<br />
Ulysses. Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been<br />
shooting the suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another:<br />
when his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end wall<br />
of the house by the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick<br />
about his shoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet, well<br />
wrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it,<br />
and he grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears.<br />
Now there was a trap door on the wall, while at one end of the<br />
pavement there was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and this<br />
exit was closed by a well-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius to<br />
stand by this door and guard it, for only one person could attack it<br />
at a time. But Agelaus shouted out, &#8220;Cannot some one go up to the trap<br />
door and tell the people what is going on? Help would come at once,<br />
and we should soon make an end of this man and his shooting.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;This may not be, Agelaus,&#8221; answered Melanthius, &#8220;the mouth of the<br />
narrow passage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court.<br />
One brave man could prevent any number from getting in. But I know<br />
what I will do, I will bring you arms from the store room, for I am<br />
sure it is there that Ulysses and his son have put them.&#8221;<br />
On this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the store<br />
room of Ulysses, house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many<br />
helmets and spears, and brought them back as fast as he could to<br />
give them to the suitors. Ulysses&#8217; heart began to fail him when he saw<br />
the suitors putting on their armour and brandishing their spears. He<br />
saw the greatness of the danger, and said to Telemachus, &#8220;Some one<br />
of the women inside is helping the suitors against us, or it may be<br />
Melanthius.&#8221;<br />
Telemachus answered, &#8220;The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I<br />
left the store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out<br />
than I have. Go, Eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one<br />
of the women who is doing this, or whether, as I suspect, it is<br />
Melanthius the son of Dolius.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to<br />
the store room to fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and<br />
said to Ulysses who was beside him, &#8220;Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it<br />
is that scoundrel Melanthius, just as we suspected, who is going to<br />
the store room. Say, shall I kill him, if I can get the better of him,<br />
or shall I bring him here that you may take your own revenge for all<br />
the many wrongs that he has done in your house?&#8221;<br />
Ulysses answered, &#8220;Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in<br />
check, no matter what they do; go back both of you and bind<br />
Melanthius&#8217; hands and feet behind him. Throw him into the store room<br />
and make the door fast behind you; then fasten a noose about his body,<br />
and string him close up to the rafters from a high bearing-post,<br />
that he may linger on in an agony.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went to<br />
the store room, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for<br />
he was busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room, so<br />
the two took their stand on either side of the door and waited. By and<br />
by Melanthius came out with a helmet in one hand, and an old<br />
dry-rotted shield in the other, which had been borne by Laertes when<br />
he was young, but which had been long since thrown aside, and the<br />
straps had become unsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him back<br />
by the hair, and threw him struggling to the ground. They bent his<br />
hands and feet well behind his back, and bound them tight with a<br />
painful bond as Ulysses had told them; then they fastened a noose<br />
about his body and strung him up from a high pillar till he was<br />
close up to the rafters, and over him did you then vaunt, O<br />
swineherd Eumaeus, saying, &#8220;Melanthius, you will pass the night on a<br />
soft bed as you deserve. You will know very well when morning comes<br />
from the streams of Oceanus, and it is time for you to be driving in<br />
your goats for the suitors to feast on.&#8221;<br />
There, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put<br />
on their armour they closed the door behind them and went back to take<br />
their places by the side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the<br />
cloister, fierce and full of fury; nevertheless, those who were in the<br />
body of the court were still both brave and many. Then Jove&#8217;s daughter<br />
Minerva came up to them, having assumed the voice and form of<br />
Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her and said, &#8220;Mentor, lend me<br />
your help, and forget not your old comrade, nor the many good turns he<br />
has done you. Besides, you are my age-mate.&#8221;<br />
But all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors from<br />
the other side raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was the<br />
first to reproach her. &#8220;Mentor,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;do not let Ulysses beguile<br />
you into siding with him and fighting the suitors. This is what we<br />
will do: when we have killed these people, father and son, we will<br />
kill you too. You shall pay for it with your head, and when we have<br />
killed you, we will take all you have, in doors or out, and bring it<br />
into hotch-pot with Ulysses&#8217; property; we will not let your sons<br />
live in your house, nor your daughters, nor shall your widow<br />
continue to live in the city of Ithaca.&#8221;<br />
This made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses very<br />
angrily. &#8220;Ulysses,&#8221; said she, &#8220;your strength and prowess are no longer<br />
what they were when you fought for nine long years among the Trojans<br />
about the noble lady Helen. You killed many a man in those days, and<br />
it was through your stratagem that Priam&#8217;s city was taken. How comes<br />
it that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are on your<br />
own ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house? Come<br />
on, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of<br />
Alcinous shall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred<br />
upon him.&#8221;<br />
But she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still<br />
further to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so she<br />
flew up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon<br />
it in the form of a swallow.<br />
Meanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon,<br />
Demoptolemus, Pisander, and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the brunt<br />
of the fight upon the suitors&#8217; side; of all those who were still<br />
fighting for their lives they were by far the most valiant, for the<br />
others had already fallen under the arrows of Ulysses. Agelaus shouted<br />
to them and said, &#8220;My friends, he will soon have to leave off, for<br />
Mentor has gone away after having done nothing for him but brag.<br />
They are standing at the doors unsupported. Do not aim at him all at<br />
once, but six of you throw your spears first, and see if you cannot<br />
cover yourselves with glory by killing him. When he has fallen we need<br />
not be uneasy about the others.&#8221;<br />
They threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them all<br />
of no effect. One hit the door post; another went against the door;<br />
the pointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as they<br />
had avoided all the spears of the suitors Ulysses said to his own men,<br />
&#8220;My friends, I should say we too had better let drive into the<br />
middle of them, or they will crown all the harm they have done us by<br />
us outright.&#8221;<br />
They therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their<br />
spears. Ulysses killed Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaeus<br />
Elatus, while the stockman killed Pisander. These all bit the dust,<br />
and as the others drew back into a corner Ulysses and his men rushed<br />
forward and regained their spears by drawing them from the bodies of<br />
the dead.<br />
The suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their<br />
weapons for the most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post of<br />
the cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaft<br />
of another struck the wall. Still, Amphimedon just took a piece of the<br />
top skin from off Telemachus&#8217;s wrist, and Ctesippus managed to graze<br />
Eumaeus&#8217;s shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and fell to<br />
the ground. Then Ulysses and his men let drive into the crowd of<br />
suitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and Eumaeus<br />
Polybus. After this the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast, and<br />
taunted him saying, &#8220;Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, do not be so<br />
foolish as to talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your<br />
speech, for the gods are far stronger than men. I make you a present<br />
of this advice to repay you for the foot which you gave Ulysses when<br />
he was begging about in his own house.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with<br />
a spear in close fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenor<br />
in the belly, and the dart went clean through him, so that he fell<br />
forward full on his face upon the ground. Then Minerva from her seat<br />
on the rafter held up her deadly aegis, and the hearts of the<br />
suitors quailed. They fled to the other end of the court like a herd<br />
of cattle maddened by the gadfly in early summer when the days are<br />
at their longest. As eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the<br />
mountains swoop down on the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon<br />
the ground, and kill them, for they cannot either fight or fly, and<br />
lookers on enjoy the sport- even so did Ulysses and his men fall<br />
upon the suitors and smite them on every side. They made a horrible<br />
groaning as their brains were being battered in, and the ground<br />
seethed with their blood.<br />
Leiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, &#8220;Ulysses I<br />
beseech you have mercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any of<br />
the women in your house either in word or deed, and I tried to stop<br />
the others. I saw them, but they would not listen, and now they are<br />
paying for their folly. I was their sacrificing priest; if you kill<br />
me, I shall die without having done anything to deserve it, and<br />
shall have got no thanks for all the good that I did.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses looked sternly at him and answered, &#8220;If you were their<br />
sacrificing priest, you must have prayed many a time that it might<br />
be long before I got home again, and that you might marry my wife<br />
and have children by her. Therefore you shall die.&#8221;<br />
With these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped<br />
when he was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then he<br />
struck Leiodes on the back of his neck, so that his head fell<br />
rolling in the dust while he was yet speaking.<br />
The minstrel Phemius son of Terpes- he who had been forced by the<br />
suitors to sing to them- now tried to save his life. He was standing<br />
near towards the trap door, and held his lyre in his hand. He did<br />
not know whether to fly out of the cloister and sit down by the<br />
altar of Jove that was in the outer court, and on which both Laertes<br />
and Ulysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or whether<br />
to go straight up to Ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the end<br />
he deemed it best to embrace Ulysses&#8217; knees. So he laid his lyre on<br />
the ground the ground between the mixing-bowl and the silver-studded<br />
seat; then going up to Ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said,<br />
&#8220;Ulysses, I beseech you have mercy on me and spare me. You will be<br />
sorry for it afterwards if you kill a bard who can sing both for<br />
gods and men as I can. I make all my lays myself, and heaven visits me<br />
with every kind of inspiration. I would sing to you as though you were<br />
a god, do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my head off. Your<br />
own son Telemachus will tell you that I did not want to frequent<br />
your house and sing to the suitors after their meals, but they were<br />
too many and too strong for me, so they made me.&#8221;<br />
Telemachus heard him, and at once went up to his father. &#8220;Hold!&#8221;<br />
he cried, &#8220;the man is guiltless, do him no hurt; and we will Medon<br />
too, who was always good to me when I was a boy, unless Philoetius<br />
or Eumaeus has already killed him, or he has fallen in your way when<br />
you were raging about the court.&#8221;<br />
Medon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under a<br />
seat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly<br />
flayed heifer&#8217;s hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemachus,<br />
and laid hold of his knees.<br />
&#8220;Here I am, my dear sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;stay your hand therefore, and<br />
tell your father, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors<br />
for having wasted his substance and been so foolishly disrespectful to<br />
yourself.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses smiled at him and answered, &#8220;Fear not; Telemachus has<br />
saved your life, that you may know in future, and tell other people,<br />
how greatly better good deeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore,<br />
outside the cloisters into the outer court, and be out of the way of<br />
the slaughter- you and the bard- while I finish my work here inside.&#8221;<br />
The pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and sat<br />
down by Jove&#8217;s great altar, looking fearfully round, and still<br />
expecting that they would be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole<br />
court carefully over, to see if anyone had managed to hide himself and<br />
was still living, but he found them all lying in the dust and<br />
weltering in their blood. They were like fishes which fishermen have<br />
netted out of the sea, and thrown upon the beach to lie gasping for<br />
water till the heat of the sun makes an end of them. Even so were<br />
the suitors lying all huddled up one against the other.<br />
Then Ulysses said to Telemachus, &#8220;Call nurse Euryclea; I have<br />
something to say to her.&#8221;<br />
Telemachus went and knocked at the door of the women&#8217;s room. &#8220;Make<br />
haste,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you old woman who have been set over all the other<br />
women in the house. Come outside; my father wishes to speak to you.&#8221;<br />
When Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women&#8217;s room<br />
and came out, following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among the<br />
corpses bespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has just<br />
been devouring an ox, and his breast and both his cheeks are all<br />
bloody, so that he is a fearful sight; even so was Ulysses<br />
besmirched from head to foot with gore. When she saw all the corpses<br />
and such a quantity of blood, she was beginning to cry out for joy,<br />
for she saw that a great deed had been done; but Ulysses checked<br />
her, &#8220;Old woman,&#8221; said he, &#8220;rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, and<br />
do not make any noise about it; it is an unholy thing to vaunt over<br />
dead men. Heaven&#8217;s doom and their own evil deeds have brought these<br />
men to destruction, for they respected no man in the whole world,<br />
neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have come to a bad<br />
end as a punishment for their wickedness and folly. Now, however, tell<br />
me which of the women in the house have misconducted themselves, and<br />
who are innocent.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I will tell you the truth, my son,&#8221; answered Euryclea. &#8220;There are<br />
fifty women in the house whom we teach to do things, such as carding<br />
wool, and all kinds of household work. Of these, twelve in all have<br />
misbehaved, and have been wanting in respect to me, and also to<br />
Penelope. They showed no disrespect to Telemachus, for he has only<br />
lately grown and his mother never permitted him to give orders to<br />
the female servants; but let me go upstairs and tell your wife all<br />
that has happened, for some god has been sending her to sleep.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Do not wake her yet,&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;but tell the women who<br />
have misconducted themselves to come to me.&#8221;<br />
Euryclea left the cloister to tell the women, and make them come<br />
to Ulysses; in the meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, and<br />
the swineherd. &#8220;Begin,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to remove the dead, and make the<br />
women help you. Then, get sponges and clean water to swill down the<br />
tables and seats. When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole<br />
cloisters, take the women into the space between the domed room and<br />
the wall of the outer court, and run them through with your swords<br />
till they are quite dead, and have forgotten all about love and the<br />
way in which they used to lie in secret with the suitors.&#8221;<br />
On this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly.<br />
First they carried the dead bodies out, and propped them up against<br />
one another in the gatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made them<br />
do their work quickly, so they had to carry the bodies out. When<br />
they had done this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges<br />
and water, while Telemachus and the two others shovelled up the<br />
blood and dirt from the ground, and the women carried it all away<br />
and put it out of doors. Then when they had made the whole place quite<br />
clean and orderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in the<br />
narrow space between the wall of the domed room and that of the<br />
yard, so that they could not get away: and Telemachus said to the<br />
other two, &#8220;I shall not let these women die a clean death, for they<br />
were insolent to me and my mother, and used to sleep with the<br />
suitors.&#8221;<br />
So saying he made a ship&#8217;s cable fast to one of the bearing-posts<br />
that supported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around<br />
the building, at a good height, lest any of the women&#8217;s feet should<br />
touch the ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that has<br />
been set for them in a thicket just as they were getting to their<br />
nest, and a terrible fate awaits them, even so did the women have to<br />
put their heads in nooses one after the other and die most<br />
miserably. Their feet moved convulsively for a while, but not for very<br />
long.<br />
As for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the inner<br />
court. There they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his<br />
vitals and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they<br />
cut off his hands and his feet.<br />
When they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went<br />
back into the house, for all was now over; and Ulysses said to the<br />
dear old nurse Euryclea, &#8220;Bring me sulphur, which cleanses all<br />
pollution, and fetch fire also that I may burn it, and purify the<br />
cloisters. Go, moreover, and tell Penelope to come here with her<br />
attendants, and also all the maid servants that are in the house.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;All that you have said is true,&#8221; answered Euryclea, &#8220;but let me<br />
bring you some clean clothes- a shirt and cloak. Do not keep these<br />
rags on your back any longer. It is not right.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;First light me a fire,&#8221; replied Ulysses.<br />
She brought the fire and sulphur, as he had bidden her, and<br />
Ulysses thoroughly purified the cloisters and both the inner and outer<br />
courts. Then she went inside to call the women and tell them what<br />
had happened; whereon they came from their apartment with torches in<br />
their hands, and pressed round Ulysses to embrace him, kissing his<br />
head and shoulders and taking hold of his hands. It made him feel as<br />
if he should like to weep, for he remembered every one of them.</p>
<p>
BOOK XXIII</p>
<p>EURYCLEA now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her<br />
dear husband had come home. Her aged knees became young again and<br />
her feet were nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bent<br />
over her head to speak to her. &#8220;Wake up Penelope, my dear child,&#8221;<br />
she exclaimed, &#8220;and see with your own eyes something that you have<br />
been wanting this long time past. Ulysses has at last indeed come home<br />
again, and has killed the suitors who were giving so much trouble in<br />
his house, eating up his estate and ill-treating his son.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My good nurse,&#8221; answered Penelope, &#8220;you must be mad. The gods<br />
sometimes send some very sensible people out of their minds, and<br />
make foolish people become sensible. This is what they must have<br />
been doing to you; for you always used to be a reasonable person.<br />
Why should you thus mock me when I have trouble enough already-<br />
talking such nonsense, and waking me up out of a sweet sleep that<br />
had taken possession of my eyes and closed them? I have never slept so<br />
soundly from the day my poor husband went to that city with the<br />
ill-omened name. Go back again into the women&#8217;s room; if it had been<br />
any one else, who had woke me up to bring me such absurd news I should<br />
have sent her away with a severe scolding. As it is, your age shall<br />
protect you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My dear child,&#8221; answered Euryclea, &#8220;I am not mocking you. It is<br />
quite true as I tell you that Ulysses is come home again. He was the<br />
stranger whom they all kept on treating so badly in the cloister.<br />
Telemachus knew all the time that he was come back, but kept his<br />
father&#8217;s secret that he might have his revenge on all these wicked<br />
people.<br />
Then Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round<br />
Euryclea, and wept for joy. &#8220;But my dear nurse,&#8221; said she, &#8220;explain<br />
this to me; if he has really come home as you say, how did he manage<br />
to overcome the wicked suitors single handed, seeing what a number<br />
of them there always were?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I was not there,&#8221; answered Euryclea, &#8220;and do not know; I only heard<br />
them groaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching and<br />
huddled up in a corner of the women&#8217;s room with the doors closed, till<br />
your son came to fetch me because his father sent him. Then I found<br />
Ulysses standing over the corpses that were lying on the ground all<br />
round him, one on top of the other. You would have enjoyed it if you<br />
could have seen him standing there all bespattered with blood and<br />
filth, and looking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all piled<br />
up in the gatehouse that is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lit<br />
a great fire to purify the house with sulphur. He has sent me to<br />
call you, so come with me that you may both be happy together after<br />
all; for now at last the desire of your heart has been fulfilled; your<br />
husband is come home to find both wife and son alive and well, and<br />
to take his revenge in his own house on the suitors who behaved so<br />
badly to him.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;My dear nurse,&#8221; said Penelope, &#8220;do not exult too confidently<br />
over all this. You know how delighted every one would be to see<br />
Ulysses come home- more particularly myself, and the son who has<br />
been born to both of us; but what you tell me cannot be really true.<br />
It is some god who is angry with the suitors for their great<br />
wickedness, and has made an end of them; for they respected no man<br />
in the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, who<br />
came near them, and they have come to a bad end in consequence of<br />
their iniquity. Ulysses is dead far away from the Achaean land; he<br />
will never return home again.&#8221;<br />
Then nurse Euryclea said, &#8220;My child, what are you talking about? but<br />
you were all hard of belief and have made up your mind that your<br />
husband is never coming, although he is in the house and by his own<br />
fire side at this very moment. Besides I can give you another proof;<br />
when I was washing him I perceived the scar which the wild boar gave<br />
him, and I wanted to tell you about it, but in his wisdom he would not<br />
let me, and clapped his hands over my mouth; so come with me and I<br />
will make this bargain with you- if I am deceiving you, you may have<br />
me killed by the most cruel death you can think of.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My dear nurse,&#8221; said Penelope, &#8220;however wise you may be you can<br />
hardly fathom the counsels of the gods. Nevertheless, we will go in<br />
search of my son, that I may see the corpses of the suitors, and the<br />
man who has killed them.&#8221;<br />
On this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so she<br />
considered whether she should keep at a distance from her husband<br />
and question him, or whether she should at once go up to him and<br />
embrace him. When, however, she had crossed the stone floor of the<br />
cloister, she sat down opposite Ulysses by the fire, against the<br />
wall at right angles [to that by which she had entered], while Ulysses<br />
sat near one of the bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, and<br />
waiting to see what his wife would say to him when she saw him. For<br />
a long time she sat silent and as one lost in amazement. At one moment<br />
she looked him full in the face, but then again directly, she was<br />
misled by his shabby clothes and failed to recognize him, till<br />
Telemachus began to reproach her and said:<br />
&#8220;Mother- but you are so hard that I cannot call you by such a<br />
name- why do you keep away from my father in this way? Why do you<br />
not sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions?<br />
No other woman could bear to keep away from her husband when he had<br />
come back to her after twenty years of absence, and after having<br />
gone through so much; but your heart always was as hard as a stone.&#8221;<br />
Penelope answered, &#8220;My son, I am so lost in astonishment that I<br />
can find no words in which either to ask questions or to answer<br />
them. I cannot even look him straight in the face. Still, if he really<br />
is Ulysses come back to his own home again, we shall get to understand<br />
one another better by and by, for there are tokens with which we two<br />
are alone acquainted, and which are hidden from all others.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses smiled at this, and said to Telemachus, &#8220;Let your mother put<br />
me to any proof she likes; she will make up her mind about it<br />
presently. She rejects me for the moment and believes me to be<br />
somebody else, because I am covered with dirt and have such bad<br />
clothes on; let us, however, consider what we had better do next. When<br />
one man has killed another, even though he was not one who would leave<br />
many friends to take up his quarrel, the man who has killed him must<br />
still say good bye to his friends and fly the country; whereas we have<br />
been killing the stay of a whole town, and all the picked youth of<br />
Ithaca. I would have you consider this matter.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Look to it yourself, father,&#8221; answered Telemachus, &#8220;for they say<br />
you are the wisest counsellor in the world, and that there is no other<br />
mortal man who can compare with you. We will follow you with right<br />
good will, nor shall you find us fail you in so far as our strength<br />
holds out.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I will say what I think will be best,&#8221; answered Ulysses. &#8220;First<br />
wash and put your shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their own<br />
room and dress; Phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre,<br />
so that if people outside hear, or any of the neighbours, or some<br />
one going along the street happens to notice it, they may think<br />
there is a wedding in the house, and no rumours about the death of the<br />
suitors will get about in the town, before we can escape to the<br />
woods upon my own land. Once there, we will settle which of the<br />
courses heaven vouchsafes us shall seem wisest.&#8221;<br />
Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they<br />
washed and put their shirts on, while the women got ready. Then<br />
Phemius took his lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and<br />
stately dance. The house re-echoed with the sound of men and women<br />
dancing, and the people outside said, &#8220;I suppose the queen has been<br />
getting married at last. She ought to be ashamed of herself for not<br />
continuing to protect her husband&#8217;s property until he comes home.&#8221;<br />
This was what they said, but they did not know what it was that<br />
had been happening. The upper servant Eurynome washed and anointed<br />
Ulysses in his own house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Minerva<br />
made him look taller and stronger than before; she also made the<br />
hair grow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like<br />
hyacinth blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders just<br />
as a skilful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan<br />
or Minerva- and his work is full of beauty- enriches a piece of silver<br />
plate by gilding it. He came from the bath looking like one of the<br />
immortals, and sat down opposite his wife on the seat he had left. &#8220;My<br />
dear,&#8221; said he, &#8220;heaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding<br />
than woman ever yet had. No other woman could bear to keep away from<br />
her husband when he had come back to her after twenty years of<br />
absence, and after having gone through so much. But come, nurse, get a<br />
bed ready for me; I will sleep alone, for this woman has a heart as<br />
hard as iron.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My dear,&#8221; answered Penelope, &#8220;I have no wish to set myself up,<br />
nor to depreciate you; but I am not struck by your appearance, for I<br />
very well remember what kind of a man you were when you set sail<br />
from Ithaca. Nevertheless, Euryclea, take his bed outside the bed<br />
chamber that he himself built. Bring the bed outside this room, and<br />
put bedding upon it with fleeces, good coverlets, and blankets.&#8221;<br />
She said this to try him, but Ulysses was very angry and said,<br />
&#8220;Wife, I am much displeased at what you have just been saying. Who has<br />
been taking my bed from the place in which I left it? He must have<br />
found it a hard task, no matter how skilled a workman he was, unless<br />
some god came and helped him to shift it. There is no man living,<br />
however strong and in his prime, who could move it from its place, for<br />
it is a marvellous curiosity which I made with my very own hands.<br />
There was a young olive growing within the precincts of the house,<br />
in full vigour, and about as thick as a bearing-post. I built my<br />
room round this with strong walls of stone and a roof to cover them,<br />
and I made the doors strong and well-fitting. Then I cut off the top<br />
boughs of the olive tree and left the stump standing. This I dressed<br />
roughly from the root upwards and then worked with carpenter&#8217;s tools<br />
well and skilfully, straightening my work by drawing a line on the<br />
wood, and making it into a bed-prop. I then bored a hole down the<br />
middle, and made it the centre-post of my bed, at which I worked<br />
till I had finished it, inlaying it with gold and silver; after this I<br />
stretched a hide of crimson leather from one side of it to the<br />
other. So you see I know all about it, and I desire to learn whether<br />
it is still there, or whether any one has been removing it by<br />
cutting down the olive tree at its roots.&#8221;<br />
When she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her, she fairly<br />
broke down. She flew weeping to his side, flung her arms about his<br />
neck, and kissed him. &#8220;Do not be angry with me Ulysses,&#8221; she cried,<br />
&#8220;you, who are the wisest of mankind. We have suffered, both of us.<br />
Heaven has denied us the happiness of spending our youth, and of<br />
growing old, together; do not then be aggrieved or take it amiss<br />
that I did not embrace you thus as soon as I saw you. I have been<br />
shuddering all the time through fear that someone might come here<br />
and deceive me with a lying story; for there are many very wicked<br />
people going about. Jove&#8217;s daughter Helen would never have yielded<br />
herself to a man from a foreign country, if she had known that the<br />
sons of Achaeans would come after her and bring her back. Heaven put<br />
it in her heart to do wrong, and she gave no thought to that sin,<br />
which has been the source of all our sorrows. Now, however, that you<br />
have convinced me by showing that you know all about our bed (which no<br />
human being has ever seen but you and I and a single maid servant, the<br />
daughter of Actor, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and<br />
who keeps the doors of our room) hard of belief though I have been I<br />
can mistrust no longer.&#8221;<br />
Then Ulysses in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear and<br />
faithful wife to his bosom. As the sight of land is welcome to men who<br />
are swimming towards the shore, when Neptune has wrecked their ship<br />
with the fury of his winds and waves- a few alone reach the land,<br />
and these, covered with brine, are thankful when they find<br />
themselves on firm ground and out of danger- even so was her husband<br />
welcome to her as she looked upon him, and she could not tear her<br />
two fair arms from about his neck. Indeed they would have gone on<br />
indulging their sorrow till rosy-fingered morn appeared, had not<br />
Minerva determined otherwise, and held night back in the far west,<br />
while she would not suffer Dawn to leave Oceanus, nor to yoke the<br />
two steeds Lampus and Phaethon that bear her onward to break the day<br />
upon mankind.<br />
At last, however, Ulysses said, &#8220;Wife, we have not yet reached the<br />
end of our troubles. I have an unknown amount of toil still to<br />
undergo. It is long and difficult, but I must go through with it,<br />
for thus the shade of Teiresias prophesied concerning me, on the day<br />
when I went down into Hades to ask about my return and that of my<br />
companions. But now let us go to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy<br />
the blessed boon of sleep.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You shall go to bed as soon as you please,&#8221; replied Penelope,<br />
&#8220;now that the gods have sent you home to your own good house and to<br />
your country. But as heaven has put it in your mind to speak of it,<br />
tell me about the task that lies before you. I shall have to hear<br />
about it later, so it is better that I should be told at once.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My dear,&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;why should you press me to tell you?<br />
Still, I will not conceal it from you, though you will not like BOOK<br />
it. I do not like it myself, for Teiresias bade me travel far and<br />
wide, carrying an oar, till I came to a country where the people<br />
have never heard of the sea, and do not even mix salt with their food.<br />
They know nothing about ships, nor oars that are as the wings of a<br />
ship. He gave me this certain token which I will not hide from you. He<br />
said that a wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was a<br />
winnowing shovel that I had on my shoulder. On this, I was to fix my<br />
oar in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to<br />
Neptune; after which I was to go home and offer hecatombs to all the<br />
gods in heaven, one after the other. As for myself, he said that death<br />
should come to me from the sea, and that my life should ebb away<br />
very gently when I was full of years and peace of mind, and my<br />
people should bless me. All this, he said, should surely come to<br />
pass.&#8221;<br />
And Penelope said, &#8220;If the gods are going to vouchsafe you a happier<br />
time in your old age, you may hope then to have some respite from<br />
misfortune.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took<br />
torches and made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they<br />
had laid them, the nurse went back into the house to go to her rest,<br />
leaving the bed chamber woman Eurynome to show Ulysses and Penelope to<br />
bed by torch light. When she had conducted them to their room she went<br />
back, and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own old bed.<br />
Telemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and<br />
made the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down to sleep<br />
in the cloisters.<br />
When Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell<br />
talking with one another. She told him how much she had had to bear in<br />
seeing the house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who had<br />
killed so many sheep and oxen on her account, and had drunk so many<br />
casks of wine. Ulysses in his turn told her what he had suffered,<br />
and how much trouble he had himself given to other people. He told her<br />
everything, and she was so delighted to listen that she never went<br />
to sleep till he had ended his whole story.<br />
He began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached<br />
the fertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the<br />
Cyclops and how he had punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his<br />
brave comrades; how he then went on to Aeolus, who received him<br />
hospitably and furthered him on his way, but even so he was not to<br />
reach home, for to his great grief a hurricane carried him out to<br />
sea again; how he went on to the Laestrygonian city Telepylos, where<br />
the people destroyed all his ships with their crews, save himself<br />
and his own ship only. Then he told of cunning Circe and her craft,<br />
and how he sailed to the chill house of Hades, to consult the ghost of<br />
the Theban prophet Teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms,<br />
and his mother who bore him and brought him up when he was a child;<br />
how he then heard the wondrous singing of the Sirens, and went on to<br />
the wandering rocks and terrible Charybdis and to Scylla, whom no<br />
man had ever yet passed in safety; how his men then ate the cattle<br />
of the sun-god, and how Jove therefore struck the ship with his<br />
thunderbolts, so that all his men perished together, himself alone<br />
being left alive; how at last he reached the Ogygian island and the<br />
nymph Calypso, who kept him there in a cave, and fed him, and wanted<br />
him to marry her, in which case she intended making him immortal so<br />
that he should never grow old, but she could not persuade him to let<br />
her do so; and how after much suffering he had found his way to the<br />
Phaeacians, who had treated him as though he had been a god, and<br />
sent him back in a ship to his own country after having given him<br />
gold, bronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was the last<br />
thing about which he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold upon<br />
him and eased the burden of his sorrows.<br />
Then Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that<br />
Ulysses had had both of his wife and of repose, she bade<br />
gold-enthroned Dawn rise out of Oceanus that she might shed light upon<br />
mankind. On this, Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said to<br />
Penelope, &#8220;Wife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles,<br />
you, here, in lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from<br />
getting home though I was longing all the time to do so. Now, however,<br />
that we have at last come together, take care of the property that<br />
is in the house. As for the sheep and goats which the wicked suitors<br />
have eaten, I will take many myself by force from other people, and<br />
will compel the Achaeans to make good the rest till they shall have<br />
filled all my yards. I am now going to the wooded lands out in the<br />
country to see my father who has so long been grieved on my account,<br />
and to yourself I will give these instructions, though you have little<br />
need of them. At sunrise it will at once get abroad that I have been<br />
killing the suitors; go upstairs, therefore, and stay there with<br />
your women. See nobody and ask no questions.&#8221;<br />
As he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus,<br />
Philoetius, and Eumaeus, and told them all to put on their armour<br />
also. This they did, and armed themselves. When they had done so, they<br />
opened the gates and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way. It was<br />
now daylight, but Minerva nevertheless concealed them in darkness<br />
and led them quickly out of the town.</p>
<p>
BOOK XXIV</p>
<p>THEN Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in<br />
his hand he held the fair golden wand with which he seals men&#8217;s eyes<br />
in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the<br />
ghosts and led them, while they followed whining and gibbering<br />
behind him. As bats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave,<br />
when one of them has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang,<br />
even so did the ghosts whine and squeal as Mercury the healer of<br />
sorrow led them down into the dark abode of death. When they had<br />
passed the waters of Oceanus and the rock Leucas, they came to the<br />
gates of the sun and the land of dreams, whereon they reached the<br />
meadow of asphodel where dwell the souls and shadows of them that<br />
can labour no more.<br />
Here they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of<br />
Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest man<br />
of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself.<br />
They gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost of<br />
Agamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered<br />
also the ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house of<br />
Aeisthus; and the ghost of Achilles spoke first.<br />
&#8220;Son of Atreus,&#8221; it said, &#8220;we used to say that Jove had loved you<br />
better from first to last than any other hero, for you were captain<br />
over many and brave men, when we were all fighting together before<br />
Troy; yet the hand of death, which no mortal can escape, was laid upon<br />
you all too early. Better for you had you fallen at Troy in the<br />
hey-day of your renown, for the Achaeans would have built a mound over<br />
your ashes, and your son would have been heir to your good name,<br />
whereas it has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Happy son of Peleus,&#8221; answered the ghost of Agamemnon, &#8220;for<br />
having died at Troy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans<br />
and the Achaeans fell round you fighting for your body. There you<br />
lay in the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless<br />
now of your chivalry. We fought the whole of the livelong day, nor<br />
should we ever have left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane to<br />
stay us. Then, when we had borne you to the ships out of the fray,<br />
we laid you on your bed and cleansed your fair skin with warm water<br />
and with ointments. The Danaans tore their hair and wept bitterly<br />
round about you. Your mother, when she heard, came with her immortal<br />
nymphs from out of the sea, and the sound of a great wailing went<br />
forth over the waters so that the Achaeans quaked for fear. They would<br />
have fled panic-stricken to their ships had not wise old Nestor<br />
whose counsel was ever truest checked them saying, &#8216;Hold, Argives, fly<br />
not sons of the Achaeans, this is his mother coming from the sea<br />
with her immortal nymphs to view the body of her son.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters of<br />
the old man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed<br />
you in immortal raiment. The nine muses also came and lifted up<br />
their sweet voices in lament- calling and answering one another; there<br />
was not an Argive but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted. Days<br />
and nights seven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but on<br />
the eighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and many a fat sheep<br />
with many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were burnt in<br />
raiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes,<br />
horse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you were<br />
burning, with the tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flames<br />
of heaven had done their work, we gathered your white bones at<br />
daybreak and laid them in ointments and in pure wine. Your mother<br />
brought us a golden vase to hold them- gift of Bacchus, and work of<br />
Vulcan himself; in this we mingled your bleached bones with those of<br />
Patroclus who had gone before you, and separate we enclosed also those<br />
of Antilochus, who had been closer to you than any other of your<br />
comrades now that Patroclus was no more.<br />
&#8220;Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point<br />
jutting out over the open Hellespont, that it might be seen from far<br />
out upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born<br />
hereafter. Your mother begged prizes from the gods, and offered them<br />
to be contended for by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have been<br />
present at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men gird<br />
themselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death of some<br />
great chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis<br />
offered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in<br />
death your fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives<br />
evermore among all mankind. But as for me, what solace had I when<br />
the days of my fighting were done? For Jove willed my destruction on<br />
my return, by the hands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked wife.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up to them with<br />
the ghosts of the suitors who had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts<br />
of Agamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them, and went<br />
up to them at once. The ghost of Agamemnon recognized Amphimedon son<br />
of Melaneus, who lived in Ithaca and had been his host, so it began to<br />
talk to him.<br />
&#8220;Amphimedon,&#8221; it said, &#8220;what has happened to all you fine young men-<br />
all of an age too- that you are come down here under the ground? One<br />
could pick no finer body of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his<br />
winds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your<br />
enemies make an end of you on the mainland when you were<br />
cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or while fighting in defence of<br />
their wives and city? Answer my question, for I have been your<br />
guest. Do you not remember how I came to your house with Menelaus,<br />
to persuade Ulysses to join us with his ships against Troy? It was a<br />
whole month ere we could resume our voyage, for we had hard work to<br />
persuade Ulysses to come with us.&#8221;<br />
And the ghost of Amphimedon answered, &#8220;Agamemnon, son of Atreus,<br />
king of men, I remember everything that you have said, and will tell<br />
you fully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought<br />
about. Ulysses had been long gone, and we were courting his wife,<br />
who did not say point blank that she would not marry, nor yet bring<br />
matters to an end, for she meant to compass our destruction: this,<br />
then, was the trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in<br />
her room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework.<br />
&#8216;Sweethearts,&#8217; said she, &#8216;Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do not<br />
press me to marry again immediately; wait- for I would not have my<br />
skill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I have completed a pall<br />
for the hero Laertes, against the time when death shall take him. He<br />
is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out<br />
without a pall.&#8217; This is what she said, and we assented; whereupon<br />
we could see her working upon her great web all day long, but at night<br />
she would unpick the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in<br />
this way for three years without our finding it out, but as time<br />
wore on and she was now in her fourth year, in the waning of moons and<br />
many days had been accomplished, one of her maids who knew what she<br />
was doing told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work,<br />
so she had to finish it whether she would or no; and when she showed<br />
us the robe she had made, after she had had it washed, its splendour<br />
was as that of the sun or moon.<br />
&#8220;Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where<br />
his swineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning<br />
from a voyage to Pylos, and the two came to the town when they had<br />
hatched their plot for our destruction. Telemachus came first, and<br />
then after him, accompanied by the swineherd, came Ulysses, clad in<br />
rags and leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old<br />
beggar. He came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the<br />
older ones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He<br />
endured both being struck and insulted without a word, though he was<br />
in his own house; but when the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired<br />
him, he and Telemachus took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber,<br />
bolting the doors behind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer<br />
his bow and a quantity of iron to be contended for by us ill-fated<br />
suitors; and this was the beginning of our end, for not one of us<br />
could string the bow- nor nearly do so. When it was about to reach the<br />
hands of Ulysses, we all of us shouted out that it should not be given<br />
him, no matter what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his<br />
having it. When he had got it in his hands he strung it with ease<br />
and sent his arrow through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the<br />
cloister and poured his arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about<br />
him. First he killed Antinous, and then, aiming straight before him,<br />
he let fly his deadly darts and they fell thick on one another. It was<br />
plain that some one of the gods was helping them, for they fell upon<br />
us with might and main throughout the cloisters, and there was a<br />
hideous sound of groaning as our brains were being battered in, and<br />
the ground seethed with our blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came<br />
by our end, and our bodies are lying still un-cared for in the house<br />
of Ulysses, for our friends at home do not yet know what has happened,<br />
so that they cannot lay us out and wash the black blood from our<br />
wounds, making moan over us according to the offices due to the<br />
departed.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes,&#8221; replied the ghost of Agamemnon,<br />
&#8220;you are indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with<br />
such rare excellence of understanding, and so faithful to her wedded<br />
lord as Penelope the daughter of Icarius. The fame, therefore, of<br />
her virtue shall never die, and the immortals shall compose a song<br />
that shall be welcome to all mankind in honour of the constancy of<br />
Penelope. How far otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of<br />
Tyndareus who killed her lawful husband; her song shall be hateful<br />
among men, for she has brought disgrace on all womankind even on the<br />
good ones.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the<br />
bowels of the earth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of<br />
the town and soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes,<br />
which he had reclaimed with infinite labour. Here was his house,<br />
with a lean-to running all round it, where the slaves who worked for<br />
him slept and sat and ate, while inside the house there was an old<br />
Sicel woman, who looked after him in this his country-farm. When<br />
Ulysses got there, he said to his son and to the other two:<br />
&#8220;Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for<br />
dinner. Meanwhile I want to see whether my father will know me, or<br />
fail to recognize me after so long an absence.&#8221;<br />
He then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius,<br />
who went straight on to the house, while he turned off into the<br />
vineyard to make trial of his father. As he went down into the great<br />
orchard, he did not see Dolius, nor any of his sons nor of the other<br />
bondsmen, for they were all gathering thorns to make a fence for the<br />
vineyard, at the place where the old man had told them; he therefore<br />
found his father alone, hoeing a vine. He had on a dirty old shirt,<br />
patched and very shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs of<br />
oxhide to save him from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves of<br />
leather; he had a goat skin cap on his head, and was looking very<br />
woe-begone. When Ulysses saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow,<br />
he stood still under a tall pear tree and began to weep. He doubted<br />
whether to embrace him, kiss him, and tell him all about his having<br />
come home, or whether he should first question him and see what he<br />
would say. In the end he deemed it best to be crafty with him, so in<br />
this mind he went up to his father, who was bending down and digging<br />
about a plant.<br />
&#8220;I see, sir,&#8221; said Ulysses, &#8220;that you are an excellent gardener-<br />
what pains you take with it, to be sure. There is not a single<br />
plant, not a fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears<br />
the trace of your attention. I trust, however, that you will not be<br />
offended if I say that you take better care of your garden than of<br />
yourself. You are old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. It cannot be<br />
because you are idle that your master takes such poor care of you,<br />
indeed your face and figure have nothing of the slave about them,<br />
and proclaim you of noble birth. I should have said that you were<br />
one of those who should wash well, eat well, and lie soft at night<br />
as old men have a right to do; but tell me, and tell me true, whose<br />
bondman are you, and in whose garden are you working? Tell me also<br />
about another matter. Is this place that I have come to really Ithaca?<br />
I met a man just now who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and had<br />
not the patience to hear my story out when I was asking him about an<br />
old friend of mine, whether he was still living, or was already dead<br />
and in the house of Hades. Believe me when I tell you that this man<br />
came to my house once when I was in my own country and never yet did<br />
any stranger come to me whom I liked better. He said that his family<br />
came from Ithaca and that his father was Laertes, son of Arceisius.<br />
I received him hospitably, making him welcome to all the abundance<br />
of my house, and when he went away I gave him all customary<br />
presents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid<br />
silver with flowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve light cloaks,<br />
and as many pieces of tapestry; I also gave him twelve cloaks of<br />
single fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number<br />
of shirts. To all this I added four good looking women skilled in<br />
all useful arts, and I let him take his choice.&#8221;<br />
His father shed tears and answered, &#8220;Sir, you have indeed come to<br />
the country that you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of<br />
wicked people. All this wealth of presents has been given to no<br />
purpose. If you could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca,<br />
he would have entertained you hospitably and would have required<br />
your presents amply when you left him- as would have been only right<br />
considering what you have already given him. But tell me, and tell<br />
me true, how many years is it since you entertained this guest- my<br />
unhappy son, as ever was? Alas! He has perished far from his own<br />
country; the fishes of the sea have eaten him, or he has fallen a prey<br />
to the birds and wild beasts of some continent. Neither his mother,<br />
nor I his father, who were his parents, could throw our arms about him<br />
and wrap him in his shroud, nor could his excellent and richly dowered<br />
wife Penelope bewail her husband as was natural upon his death bed,<br />
and close his eyes according to the offices due to the departed. But<br />
now, tell me truly for I want to know. Who and whence are you- tell me<br />
of your town and parents? Where is the ship lying that has brought you<br />
and your men to Ithaca? Or were you a passenger on some other man&#8217;s<br />
ship, and those who brought you here have gone on their way and left<br />
you?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I will tell you everything,&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;quite truly. I come<br />
from Alybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas, who<br />
is the son of Polypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove me<br />
off my course as I was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried here<br />
against my will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off the<br />
open country outside the town, and this is the fifth year since<br />
Ulysses left my country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good for<br />
him when he left me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both<br />
he and I rejoiced to see them as we parted, for we had every hope that<br />
we should have another friendly meeting and exchange presents.&#8221;<br />
A dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled<br />
both hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his<br />
grey head, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was<br />
touched, and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father;<br />
then he sprang towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him,<br />
saying, &#8220;I am he, father, about whom you are asking- I have returned<br />
after having been away for twenty years. But cease your sighing and<br />
lamentation- we have no time to lose, for I should tell you that I<br />
have been killing the suitors in my house, to punish them for their<br />
insolence and crimes.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;If you really are my son Ulysses,&#8221; replied Laertes, &#8220;and have<br />
come back again, you must give me such manifest proof of your identity<br />
as shall convince me.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;First observe this scar,&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;which I got from a<br />
boar&#8217;s tusk when I was hunting on Mount Parnassus. You and my mother<br />
had sent me to Autolycus, my mother&#8217;s father, to receive the<br />
presents which when he was over here he had promised to give me.<br />
Furthermore I will point out to you the trees in the vineyard which<br />
you gave me, and I asked you all about them as I followed you round<br />
the garden. We went over them all, and you told me their names and<br />
what they all were. You gave me thirteen pear trees, ten apple<br />
trees, and forty fig trees; you also said you would give me fifty rows<br />
of vines; there was corn planted between each row, and they yield<br />
grapes of every kind when the heat of heaven has been laid heavy<br />
upon them.&#8221;<br />
Laertes&#8217; strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs<br />
which his son had given him. He threw his arms about him, and<br />
Ulysses had to support him, or he would have gone off into a swoon;<br />
but as soon as he came to, and was beginning to recover his senses, he<br />
said, &#8220;O father Jove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if<br />
the suitors have really been punished for their insolence and folly.<br />
Nevertheless, I am much afraid that I shall have all the townspeople<br />
of Ithaca up here directly, and they will be sending messengers<br />
everywhere throughout the cities of the Cephallenians.&#8221;<br />
Ulysses answered, &#8220;Take heart and do not trouble yourself about<br />
that, but let us go into the house hard by your garden. I have already<br />
told Telemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner<br />
ready as soon as possible.&#8221;<br />
Thus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When<br />
they got there they found Telemachus with the stockman and the<br />
swineherd cutting up meat and mixing wine with water. Then the old<br />
Sicel woman took Laertes inside and washed him and anointed him with<br />
oil. She put him on a good cloak, and Minerva came up to him and<br />
gave him a more imposing presence, making him taller and stouter<br />
than before. When he came back his son was surprised to see him<br />
looking so like an immortal, and said to him, &#8220;My dear father, some<br />
one of the gods has been making you much taller and better-looking.&#8221;<br />
Laertes answered, &#8220;Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo,<br />
that I were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and<br />
took Nericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were still<br />
what I then was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on,<br />
I should have been able to stand by you and help you against the<br />
suitors. I should have killed a great many of them, and you would have<br />
rejoiced to see it.&#8221;<br />
Thus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their<br />
work and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each his<br />
proper place on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by<br />
and by old Dolius and his sons left their work and came up, for<br />
their mother, the Sicel woman who looked after Laertes now that he was<br />
growing old, had been to fetch them. When they saw Ulysses and were<br />
certain it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but<br />
Ulysses scolded them good-naturedly and said, &#8220;Sit down to your<br />
dinner, old man, and never mind about your surprise; we have been<br />
wanting to begin for some time and have been waiting for you.&#8221;<br />
Then Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. &#8220;Sir,&#8221;<br />
said he, seizing his master&#8217;s hand and kissing it at the wrist, &#8220;we<br />
have long been wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to us<br />
after we had given up hoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods<br />
prosper you. But tell me, does Penelope already know of your return,<br />
or shall we send some one to tell her?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Old man,&#8221; answered Ulysses, &#8220;she knows already, so you need not<br />
trouble about that.&#8221; On this he took his seat, and the sons of<br />
Dolius gathered round Ulysses to give him greeting and embrace him one<br />
after the other; then they took their seats in due order near Dolius<br />
their father.<br />
While they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went<br />
round the town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had<br />
befallen the suitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of it<br />
they gathered from every quarter, groaning and hooting before the<br />
house of Ulysses. They took the dead away, buried every man his own,<br />
and put the bodies of those who came from elsewhere on board the<br />
fishing vessels, for the fishermen to take each of them to his own<br />
place. They then met angrily in the place of assembly, and when they<br />
were got together Eupeithes rose to speak. He was overwhelmed with<br />
grief for the death of his son Antinous, who had been the first man<br />
killed by Ulysses, so he said, weeping bitterly, &#8220;My friend, this<br />
man has done the Achaeans great wrong. He took many of our best men<br />
away with him in his fleet, and he has lost both ships and men; now,<br />
moreover, on his return he has been killing all the foremost men among<br />
the Cephallenians. Let us be up and doing before he can get away to<br />
Pylos or to Elis where the Epeans rule, or we shall be ashamed of<br />
ourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an everlasting disgrace to<br />
us if we do not avenge the murder of our sons and brothers. For my own<br />
part I should have no mote pleasure in life, but had rather die at<br />
once. Let us be up, then, and after them, before they can cross over<br />
to the mainland.&#8221;<br />
He wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard<br />
Phemius had now woke up, and came to them from the house of Ulysses.<br />
Every one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the<br />
middle of the assembly, and Medon said, &#8220;Hear me, men of Ithaca.<br />
Ulysses did not do these things against the will of heaven. I myself<br />
saw an immortal god take the form of Mentor and stand beside him. This<br />
god appeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and now going<br />
furiously about the court and attacking the suitors whereon they<br />
fell thick on one another.&#8221;<br />
On this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of<br />
Mastor, rose to speak, for he was the only man among them who knew<br />
both past and future; so he spoke to them plainly and in all<br />
honesty, saying,<br />
&#8220;Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out<br />
as they have; you would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when we<br />
bade you check the folly of your sons who were doing much wrong in the<br />
wantonness of their hearts- wasting the substance and dishonouring the<br />
wife of a chieftain who they thought would not return. Now, however,<br />
let it be as I say, and do as I tell you. Do not go out against<br />
Ulysses, or you may find that you have been drawing down evil on<br />
your own heads.&#8221;<br />
This was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and<br />
at once left the assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for<br />
the speech of Halitherses displeased them, and they sided with<br />
Eupeithes; they therefore hurried off for their armour, and when<br />
they had armed themselves, they met together in front of the city, and<br />
Eupeithes led them on in their folly. He thought he was going to<br />
avenge the murder of his son, whereas in truth he was never to return,<br />
but was himself to perish in his attempt.<br />
Then Minerva said to Jove, &#8220;Father, son of Saturn, king of kings,<br />
answer me this question- What do you propose to do? Will you set<br />
them fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?&#8221;<br />
And Jove answered, &#8220;My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by<br />
your own arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge<br />
upon the suitors? Do whatever you like, but I will tell you what I<br />
think will be most reasonable arrangement. Now that Ulysses is<br />
revenged, let them swear to a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he<br />
shall continue to rule, while we cause the others to forgive and<br />
forget the massacre of their sons and brothers. Let them then all<br />
become friends as heretofore, and let peace and plenty reign.&#8221;<br />
This was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so down<br />
she darted from off the topmost summits of Olympus.<br />
Now when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by<br />
saying, &#8220;Some of you go out and see if they are not getting close up<br />
to us.&#8221; So one of Dolius&#8217;s sons went as he was bid. Standing on the<br />
threshold he could see them all quite near, and said to Ulysses, &#8220;Here<br />
they are, let us put on our armour at once.&#8221;<br />
They put on their armour as fast as they could- that is to say<br />
Ulysses, his three men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes also and<br />
Dolius did the same- warriors by necessity in spite of their grey<br />
hair. When they had all put on their armour, they opened the gate<br />
and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way.<br />
Then Jove&#8217;s daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed the<br />
form and voice of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said<br />
to his son Telemachus, &#8220;Telemachus, now that are about to fight in<br />
an engagement, which will show every man&#8217;s mettle, be sure not to<br />
disgrace your ancestors, who were eminent for their strength and<br />
courage all the world over.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You say truly, my dear father,&#8221; answered Telemachus, &#8220;and you shall<br />
see, if you will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your family.&#8221;<br />
Laertes was delighted when he heard this. &#8220;Good heavens, he<br />
exclaimed, &#8220;what a day I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. My<br />
son and grandson are vying with one another in the matter of valour.&#8221;<br />
On this Minerva came close up to him and said, &#8220;Son of Arceisius-<br />
best friend I have in the world- pray to the blue-eyed damsel, and<br />
to Jove her father; then poise your spear and hurl it.&#8221;<br />
As she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he had<br />
prayed to her he poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes&#8217;<br />
helmet, and the spear went right through it, for the helmet stayed<br />
it not, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to<br />
the ground. Meantime Ulysses and his son fell the front line of the<br />
foe and smote them with their swords and spears; indeed, they would<br />
have killed every one of them, and prevented them from ever getting<br />
home again, only Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one<br />
pause. &#8220;Men of Ithaca,&#8221; she cried, cease this dreadful war, and settle<br />
the matter at once without further bloodshed.&#8221;<br />
On this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that<br />
their arms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the<br />
sound of the goddess&#8217;s voice, and they fled back to the city for their<br />
lives. But Ulysses gave a great cry, and gathering himself together<br />
swooped down like a soaring eagle. Then the son of Saturn sent a<br />
thunderbolt of fire that fell just in front of Minerva, so she said to<br />
Ulysses, &#8220;Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, or<br />
Jove will be angry with you.&#8221;<br />
Thus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva<br />
assumed the form and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of<br />
peace between the two contending parties.</p>
