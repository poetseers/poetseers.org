				<p>
Came then striding in the night<br />
the walker of darkness.<br />
In that gabled hall <br />
the warriors slept,<br />
those who guarded the hall. . .<br />
all but one.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It was well known among men<br />
that, if God willed it not,<br />
no one could drag<br />
that demon to the shadows.<br />
But Beowulf watched<br />
in anger, waiting<br />
the battle&#8217;s outcome.</p>
<p>Came then from the moor<br />
under the misty hills<br />
Grendel stalking under<br />
the weight of God&#8217;s anger.<br />
That wicked ravager<br />
planned to ensnare<br />
many of the race of men<br />
in the high hall.</p>
<p>He strode under the clouds,<br />
seeking eagerly, till he came to <br />
the wine-hall, the treasure-hall<br />
of men decorated in gold.<br />
Nor was it the first time he <br />
had sought Hrothgar&#8217;s home.<br />
But never in his life before<br />
&#8211;or since&#8211;<br />
did he find worse luck!</p>
<p>Came then to the building<br />
that creature bereft of joys.<br />
When he touched it with his hands<br />
the door gave way at once<br />
though its bands were forged <br />
in fire. Intending evil,<br />
enraged, he swung the door wide,<br />
stood at the building&#8217;s mouth.<br />
Quickly the foe moved<br />
across the well-made floor,<br />
in an angry mood&#8211;a horrible light, <br />
like fire, in his eyes. <br />
He saw the many warriors in the building,<br />
that band of kinsmen asleep <br />
together, and his spirit laughed:<br />
that monster expected<br />
to rip life from the body of each <br />
one before morning came.<br />
He expected a plentiful meal.<br />
(It was his fate<br />
that he eat no more<br />
of the race of men<br />
after that night. . .)</p>
<p>The mighty one, Beowulf, watched,<br />
waiting to see how that wicked one<br />
would go about starting.<br />
Nor did the wretch delay, <br />
but set about seizing<br />
a sleeping warrior unawares<br />
and bit into his bone locks,<br />
drinking the streams of blood,<br />
then swallowing huge morsels<br />
of flesh. Quickly he ate that man,<br />
even to his hands and feet.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Forward Grendel came,<br />
stepping nearer. Then <br />
he reached for Beowulf.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Beowulf grasped his arm <br />
and sat up. The criminal <br />
knew he had not met<br />
in this middle-earth<br />
another with such a grip.<br />
Grendel&#8217;s spirit was afraid<br />
and his heart eager <br />
to get away, to flee<br />
to his hiding place, flee <br />
to the devils he kept<br />
for company. Never had he met<br />
a man such as this.</p>
<p>Beowulf then kept in mind <br />
the speeches he had made <br />
in the evening and stood <br />
upright, firmly grasping<br />
Grendel&#8217;s hand until<br />
the fingers broke.</p>
<p>The monster strove to escape.<br />
Beowulf stepped closer. That <br />
famous monster suddenly wanted <br />
to disappear into the fens.<br />
He realized the power of those hands, <br />
the wrathful grip he was in. <br />
Grendel felt sorry <br />
he had made a trip to Herot.</p>
<p>That hall of warriors dinned.<br />
All the Danes of the city,<br />
all the brave ones, feared disaster. <br />
The building resounded.<br />
It is a wonder the wine-hall<br />
withstood the battle,<br />
that the beautiful building<br />
did not fall to the ground.<br />
But it was made fast,<br />
within and without, <br />
with iron bands <br />
forged with great skill.<br />
I have heard say<br />
many a mead bench<br />
adorned in gold<br />
went flying when<br />
those hostiles fought.<br />
No wise man had ever thought<br />
that splendid building could <br />
be damaged (unless a fire<br />
should swallow it).</p>
<p>The din rose louder, the Danes stood<br />
in dreadful terror&#8211;everyone<br />
heard lamentation, a terrifying<br />
song, through the wall:<br />
Grendel, Hell&#8217;s friend, <br />
God&#8217;s enemy, sang in defeat,<br />
bewailing his wound.<br />
That man, mightiest <br />
of warriors alive, held fast.<br />
He would not <br />
for any reason<br />
allow his murderous visitor<br />
to escape alive,<br />
to keep the days of his life.</p>
<p>Beowulf&#8217;s warriors brandished<br />
many a sword, inheritances<br />
from the ancient days,<br />
trying to protect their chief,<br />
but that did no good: they <br />
could not have known, those <br />
brave warriors as they fought,<br />
striking from all sides, seeking <br />
to take Grendel&#8217;s soul, that <br />
no battle sword could harm him&#8211;<br />
he had enchantment against <br />
the edges of weapons.</p>
<p>The end of Grendel&#8217;s life was <br />
miserable, and he would travel <br />
far into the hands of fiends.<br />
Grendel, the foe of God, who had <br />
long troubled the spirits of men<br />
with his crimes, found that <br />
his body could not stand against<br />
the hand grip of that warrior.</p>
<p>Each was hateful to the other <br />
alive. The horrible monster endured <br />
a wound: the bone-locks <br />
of his shoulder gave way, <br />
and his sinews sprang out.<br />
The glory of battle went to <br />
Beowulf, and Grendel, <br />
mortally wounded,<br />
sought his sad home<br />
under the fen slope.<br />
He knew surely that<br />
his life had reached its end,<br />
the number of his days gone.</p>
<p>The hope of the Danes<br />
had come to pass&#8211;He<br />
who came from far had<br />
cleansed Hrothgar&#8217;s hall<br />
and saved it from affliction.<br />
They rejoiced it that <br />
night&#8217;s work. Beowulf had <br />
fulfilled his promise <br />
to the Danes and all <br />
the distress they had endured,<br />
all the trouble and sorrow,<br />
had reached an end.</p>
<p>The fact was plain when <br />
Beowulf laid that arm <br />
and shoulder down, there <br />
altogether, Grendel&#8217;s claw,<br />
under the vaulted roof.</p>
<p><b>The Warriors Rejoice</b></p>
<p>I have heard say that <br />
on that morning warriors <br />
came from near and far<br />
to look at the wonder.<br />
Grendel&#8217;s death made <br />
no warrior sad.</p>
<p>They looked at the huge footprints<br />
and the path he had taken,<br />
dragging himself wearily away<br />
after he had been overcome in battle.<br />
The fated fugitive&#8217;s bloody tracks<br />
led into the water-monster&#8217;s mere.<br />
There bloody water boiled,<br />
a horrible swirl of waves<br />
mingled with hot gore.<br />
That doomed one had died,<br />
deprived of joy, <br />
in his fen refuge, his heathen<br />
soul taken into Hell.</p>
<p>After seeing that place<br />
the warriors once again<br />
rode their horses to Herot.<br />
They spoke of Beowulf&#8217;s <br />
glorious deed, often saying<br />
that no man under the sky&#8217;s <br />
expanse, North nor South <br />
between the seas, no man<br />
who bore a shield, was more<br />
worthy of a kingdom. They, <br />
however, never found fault<br />
with the gracious Hrothgar&#8211;<br />
he was a good king.</p>
<p>The warriors let their <br />
bay horses go, a contest <br />
for the best horse, <br />
galloping through whatever <br />
path looked fair.<br />
Sometimes a king&#8217;s man, a warrior <br />
covered in glory who knew <br />
the old traditions, would be <br />
reminded of an ancient song, <br />
and he would call up words adorned <br />
in truth. The man would think<br />
of Beowulf&#8217;s deeds and quickly <br />
compose a skillful tale in words.</p>
<p>Then he sang of things he&#8217;d heard <br />
about Sigemund&#8217;s valorous deeds, <br />
untold things about Weals&#8217;s son,<br />
his struggles, his wide journeys and feuds.<br />
The singer told things the children<br />
of men did not know, except for<br />
Fitela, Sigemund&#8217;s nephew, who<br />
stood with him in battle.<br />
With swords those two felled<br />
many from the race of giants.<br />
After Sigemund&#8217;s death day<br />
not a little fame sprang to him,<br />
about his hardy fight and killing<br />
of a dragon, keeper of a hoard.<br />
Under gray stone that prince alone <br />
engaged in that audacious deed,<br />
not even Fitela with him.</p>
<p>Anyway, it happened that<br />
Sigemund&#8217;s sword went clear through<br />
the huge dragon and <br />
that splendid iron<br />
stuck in the wall.<br />
The dragon died violently.<br />
By brave deeds the hero<br />
won a ring hoard for himself.<br />
He bore into a ship&#8217;s bosom<br />
those bright treasures <br />
of the Weal kin,<br />
and the dragon melted<br />
of its own heat.</p>
<p>Sigemund was by far the most <br />
renowned adventurer. N He had <br />
first prospered under King Heremod,<br />
but that man&#8217;s strength<br />
and victory subsided.<br />
Among the Jutes<br />
Heremod was betrayed<br />
into enemy hands<br />
and put to death.<br />
Sorrow oppressed him too long.<br />
He became a trouble to his people.<br />
Many a wise man<br />
bewailed the old days<br />
when Heremod had taken<br />
the protector&#8217;s position<br />
to hold the treasure<br />
of the Danish kingdom.<br />
He had loved the Geats<br />
more than his own people:<br />
evil had seized him.<br />
Thus told the song.</p>
<p>Sometimes the warriors raced<br />
their horses on the yellow road. <br />
The morning sped away. <br />
Many a brave warrior<br />
went to the high hall<br />
to see the wonder.<br />
So also the king himself,<br />
the keeper of the rings,<br />
leaving the queen&#8217;s rooms,<br />
went with his famous company.<br />
And the queen also<br />
with a troop of maidens<br />
walked among the mead seats. </p>
