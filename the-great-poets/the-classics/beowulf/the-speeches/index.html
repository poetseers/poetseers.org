				<p>
Hrothgar, standing on the steps,<br />
seeing the golden roof<br />
and Grendel&#8217;s hand, spoke:<br />
&#8220;For this sight I give<br />
thanks to the Almighty.<br />
I have suffered much<br />
from Grendel&#8217;s scourge.<br />
God, the glorious protector,<br />
works wonder after wonder.<br />
Only yesterday I expected<br />
these woes would never end&#8211;<br />
this best of houses<br />
stood shining in blood<br />
and all my wise ones said<br />
we could never protect <br />
the people and land<br />
from the work of demons<br />
and evil spirits. Now<br />
a warrior, through God&#8217;s might,<br />
has performed a deed we,<br />
in our wisdom, could not contrive.<br />
The woman who bore you,<br />
Beowulf, if she yet lives,<br />
may say the Eternal Maker<br />
was kind in her child bearing.<br />
Now, Beowulf, best of warriors,<br />
I love you as a son:<br />
have from this moment<br />
a new kinship. Nor will there be <br />
any lack of earthly things <br />
I have power over.<br />
Often I have given gifts<br />
to a lesser warrior, weaker<br />
in fighting. You have, by<br />
your deeds, achieved fame<br />
forever. May God repay you<br />
always as He has just now!&#8221;</p>
<p>Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, spoke:<br />
&#8220;We have done this work of valor<br />
against the strength of an uncanny<br />
foe. I wish you might have seen<br />
this enemy killed in his gear.<br />
I planned to bind him quickly<br />
to his deathbed with hand grips.<br />
I thought I could pin him down<br />
struggling for life without <br />
his body&#8217;s escape. But I could not <br />
keep him from going; the Creator <br />
did not will it, and I could not <br />
hold him firmly enough. The foe <br />
was too powerful in his going. <br />
However, he left behind his hand <br />
to save his life, and his arm <br />
and shoulder, though that won&#8217;t buy<br />
the wretch much comfort.<br />
The evil-doer, afflicted by sin,<br />
won&#8217;t live much longer;<br />
pain with its strong grip<br />
has seized him in deadly bonds,<br />
and there shall he await,<br />
guilty of crime, the great judgment,<br />
how the bright creator<br />
will decree. . . &#8220;</p>
<p>Then was the warrior silent<br />
in speaking of his war-like deed,<br />
and the nobles beheld<br />
the hand at the high roof.<br />
On each of the foe&#8217;s fingers<br />
were nails like steel.<br />
Everyone agreed the heathen&#8217;s<br />
claw was horrible<br />
and that the wretch&#8217;s <br />
bloody battle hand<br />
could not be harmed<br />
by the best of iron.</p>
<p><b>Entertainment in Herot</b></p>
<p>Then it was ordered<br />
that Herot be decorated.<br />
Many there were, <br />
men and women, who<br />
prepared that guest-hall.<br />
Gold ornaments shone,<br />
wondrous sights on the walls,<br />
for people to look at.<br />
That bright building <br />
had been much hurt,<br />
though its bands<br />
were made of iron.<br />
Hinges had been sprung<br />
apart. The roof alone<br />
had escaped damage before <br />
that monster, wicked outlaw, <br />
turned in flight <br />
despairing of his life.<br />
(Fate is not easy<br />
to flee from,<br />
try it who will&#8211;<br />
the children of men,<br />
bearers of souls,<br />
must go to the prepared place,<br />
his body rest<br />
fast in the grave,<br />
sleep after the feast.)</p>
<p>Then came the time<br />
that Hrothgar himself<br />
went to the feast.<br />
Never have I heard <br />
of a greater company<br />
gathered around a treasure giver.<br />
Great ones sat at the benches<br />
and rejoiced with the cup.<br />
Those brave kinsmen<br />
drank many a mead cup<br />
in the high hall with<br />
Hrothgar and Hrothulf, his nephew.<br />
Herot was filled with friends<br />
(treachery had not yet<br />
come to the Danes).</p>
<p>Hrothgar gave Beowulf<br />
a gilded banner,<br />
decorated battle flag,<br />
as reward for victory.<br />
Also a helmet, armor, and<br />
a famous, precious sword<br />
were given to the hero<br />
before that company.<br />
Around the helmet&#8217;s top<br />
as head-protection was<br />
a wrap of metal bands<br />
so that no sharpened swords<br />
could harm him <br />
in the battle storm<br />
when the shield-warriors fight.</p>
<p>Beowulf drank the cup.<br />
He had no reason to be <br />
ashamed among warriors<br />
for taking those rich gifts.<br />
Never have I heard<br />
of golden treasure given<br />
at the ale bench in<br />
a more friendly way.</p>
<p>The king ordered eight horses <br />
with gold-plaited bridles<br />
led into the hall.<br />
On one sat a saddle<br />
inlaid with jewels&#8211;<br />
it had been Hrothgar&#8217;s<br />
when he had gone to sword play.<br />
Never had he failed<br />
at the front<br />
when corpses fell.<br />
Hrothgar gave horses and weapons,<br />
telling Beowulf to enjoy them well.<br />
Thus like a man<br />
that great prince,<br />
treasure giver of heroes,<br />
repaid Beowulf for his battle,<br />
and no man who tells the truth.<br />
will blame him. Then that chief of nobles<br />
gave to each one on the mead bench<br />
who had taken the ocean&#8217;s way<br />
with Beowulf an heirloom<br />
and ordered that the one<br />
Grendel killed in wickedness<br />
should be paid for in gold.<br />
(Grendel would have killed<br />
more of them if wise God,<br />
and Beowulf&#8217;s courage,<br />
had not prevented it.<br />
The Creator then ruled the race of men,<br />
as He does yet; and, therefore,<br />
understanding is best:<br />
the forethought of mind.<br />
Much shall he abide,<br />
from friends and foes,<br />
who lives long in these <br />
days of strife as he <br />
makes use of this world!)</p>
<p><b>The Poet Sings Of Old Trouble, how Hildeburh, married to stop a feud between Jutes and Danes, saw her husband, brother, and son killed</b></p>
<p>In the presence of the battle leader<br />
Hrothgar&#8217;s poet touched<br />
the harp and recited<br />
many songs for entertainment <br />
in the hall. He sang <br />
of Finn&#8217;s offspring and how <br />
Hnaef of the Danes fell <br />
in a Jute battlefield.<br />
Indeed Hildeburh did not have <br />
much cause to praise<br />
the good faith of her in-laws,<br />
the Jutes: though blameless, <br />
she was deprived of dear ones <br />
by the shield play, both her son <br />
and Hnaef, her brother, in fate <br />
fell to spear wounds.<br />
That was a sad woman.</p>
<p>Not without cause, after <br />
morning came, when she could <br />
see under the sky,<br />
did she bewail the decree <br />
of fate, the slaughter <br />
of kinsmen. At first she had <br />
possessed the world&#8217;s joy.<br />
War took all but<br />
a few of the Jute men<br />
so they could not<br />
fight the Dane Hengst nor<br />
protect the survivors.</p>
<p>But Hengst offered<br />
them a deal: that <br />
the Jutes would make<br />
room for the Danes <br />
in the beer hall and <br />
that with gifts<br />
King Finn would honor<br />
Hengst&#8217;s men, rings, <br />
entertainment, and treasures <br />
of plated gold as if <br />
they were his kin.<br />
Both sides agreed to the peace.</p>
<p>Finn declared to Hengst<br />
honest oaths that the survivors<br />
would be held in honor<br />
and that no man,<br />
by words nor works,<br />
would break the peace<br />
nor in cruelty mention<br />
that they were being friendly<br />
with the killer of their king,<br />
since a winter freeze had<br />
forced it. If any of the Jutes <br />
in daring speech mentioned it,<br />
then the edge of the sword<br />
would settle the matter.</p>
<p>A funeral pyre was readied<br />
and gold brought from the hoard.<br />
The best of the Danes<br />
were ready for the pyre.<br />
At the fire were blood stained<br />
shirts of mail, boar images<br />
all golden and iron-hard.<br />
Not a few noble ones<br />
had been destroyed by wounds!</p>
<p>Hildeburh ordered her son<br />
committed to the heat<br />
of Hneaf&#8217;s pyre; his muscles burned <br />
at the shoulder of his uncle.<br />
The woman mourned, <br />
sang lamentation,<br />
as the warrior ascended,<br />
waned to the clouds,<br />
as the greatest of death fires<br />
roared on the barrow.<br />
Heads melted,<br />
wounds, hostile bites<br />
to the body, opened<br />
and burst; blood<br />
sprang out. Fire,<br />
the greediest of spirits,<br />
swallowed everything,<br />
of both peoples, there together.<br />
Their power had passed away.</p>
<p>The warriors departed,<br />
bereft of friends,<br />
to seek shelter<br />
in the Jute land,<br />
Jute homes and stronghold.<br />
So Hengst spent <br />
a slaughter-stained winter<br />
with Finn because<br />
he could not leave.<br />
He thought of home<br />
but could not go<br />
in a ring-prowed ship<br />
against the sea storm,<br />
against the wind.<br />
The water waves locked<br />
in icy bindings until<br />
another year came<br />
to the gardens,<br />
as they do yet,<br />
glorious bright weather<br />
to watch over the hall.</p>
<p>When winter had passed<br />
and earth&#8217;s bosom turned <br />
fair, the adventurer was<br />
eager to go, the guest<br />
from the dwelling, but first <br />
Hengst thought more of revenge <br />
for injury than of a sea journey,<br />
how he might cause<br />
a hostile meeting<br />
with the Jutes<br />
to repay them with iron.<br />
So it was he did not complain<br />
when the son of Hunlaf<br />
laid Battle Bright,<br />
the best of swords,<br />
whose edges were <br />
known to the Jutes,<br />
on his lap.<br />
So it was that Finn,<br />
bold in spirit,<br />
in his turn met<br />
a cruel death by sword<br />
in his own home<br />
after Guthlaf and Oslaf<br />
complained of their sorrows,<br />
blaming their woes<br />
on that sea journey.<br />
A restless spirit is not<br />
restrained by the breast.</p>
<p>Then was the hall reddened<br />
with the life blood of enemies.<br />
King Finn was slain<br />
and Hildeburh taken.<br />
The Danish warriors<br />
carried to their ships<br />
all the goods they could find <br />
in the house, precious jewels. <br />
They took the queen <br />
on a sea journey<br />
back to her people.</p>
<p>The poet&#8217;s song was sung,<br />
the mirth rose, bench noise,<br />
as the cup bearers offered <br />
wine from wondrous vessels.</p>
