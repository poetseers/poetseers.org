				<p>
The paved road guided the men.<br />
Their war-coats shone,<br />
the hard locks ringing<br />
as they came toward the hall.<br />
The sea-weary ones set<br />
their broad, strong shields<br />
against the building&#8217;s wall,<br />
then sat down on benches,<br />
their armor resounding.<br />
They stood their spears together,<br />
ash wood tipped with gray,<br />
an iron troop.</p>
<p>Then a proud Danish warrior asked them:<br />
&#8220;From where have you carried<br />
these gold-inlaid shields,<br />
these shirts of mail,<br />
masked helmets, and battle shafts?<br />
I am Hrothgar&#8217;s messenger and officer.<br />
Never have I seen braver strangers.<br />
I expect you&#8217;re here<br />
to find adventure, not asylum.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brave one answered him,<br />
he of the proud Geats tribe,<br />
hard under his helmet:<br />
&#8220;We are Hygelac&#8217;s table companions.<br />
Beowulf is my name.<br />
I will declare to the great lord,<br />
Healfdene&#8217;s son, my errand,<br />
if your prince will greet us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wulfgar spoke&#8211;he was <br />
of the Wendla tribe<br />
and known to many<br />
for fighting and wisdom&#8211;<br />
&#8220;I will ask the lord of the Danes,<br />
the giver of rings,<br />
if he will reward your journey<br />
and speedily make his wishes known.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wulfgar went quickly<br />
to where Hrothgar sat,<br />
old and gray, with<br />
his most trusted men.<br />
He went before the face<br />
of the Dane&#8217;s lord,<br />
knowing the customs of warriors.<br />
Wulfgar spoke to his friendly lord: <br />
&#8220;From far over the sea&#8217;s expanse<br />
has come a man of the Geats,<br />
a chief of warriors named Beowulf.<br />
He and his men have, my lord,<br />
asked to exchange words with you.<br />
Do not refuse the request,<br />
Hrothgar! These men look worthy<br />
of a warrior&#8217;s esteem. Indeed,<br />
the chief among them,<br />
he who guides them, is strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hrothgar, guard of the Danes, spoke:<br />
&#8220;I knew him when he was a boy.<br />
His father is called Edgtheow.<br />
To that man Hrethel of the Geats<br />
gave his only daughter.<br />
Now his offspring has come <br />
in bravery seeking a loyal friend.<br />
Seafarers who took gifts<br />
to the Geats say that he<br />
has the strength of thirty men <br />
in his hand grip.<br />
Holy God, out of kindness,<br />
has sent this man to us<br />
to save us from Grendel&#8217;s terror.<br />
I shall give treasures<br />
to that brave man<br />
for his impetuous courage.<br />
Be you in haste: go,<br />
call in this band of kinsmen.<br />
Say to them that they are welcome<br />
to the Danish people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wulfgar, famous warrior, <br />
went to the door: <br />
&#8220;My victorious lord, <br />
prince of the Danes, <br />
bids me say he knows <br />
your noble descent and <br />
that brave men who<br />
come over the sea swells<br />
are welcome to him. <br />
Come with your war dress,<br />
under your helmets,<br />
to see Hrothgar, but<br />
let your war shields<br />
and wooden spears await<br />
the outcome of your talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mighty one arose,<br />
surrounded by warriors,<br />
a mighty band of men.<br />
Some remained with the weapons,<br />
as the brave one ordered.<br />
The rest hastened, <br />
as the man guided,<br />
under Herot&#8217;s roof.</p>
<p>The great warrior went,<br />
hard under his helmet,<br />
until he stood within<br />
in his shining coat of mail,<br />
his armor-net sewn by smiths.</p>
<p>Beowulf spoke: <br />
&#8220;I am Hygelac&#8217;s kinsman and warrior.<br />
I have undertaken many <br />
glorious deeds. I learned <br />
of Grendel in my native land.<br />
Seafarers say this place,<br />
the best of halls,<br />
stands idle and useless<br />
after sundown. Hrothgar,<br />
the wise men among my people<br />
advised that I seek you<br />
because they know my strength&#8211;<br />
they saw me come from battles<br />
stained in the blood of my enemies, <br />
when I destroyed a family of giants,<br />
when I endured pain all night,<br />
killing water monsters,<br />
grinding them to bits,<br />
to avenge for the Geats<br />
those who asked for misery.<br />
And now I shall, alone, <br />
fight Grendel. I ask you, <br />
lord of the Danes,<br />
protector of this people,<br />
for only one favor:<br />
that you refuse me not,<br />
fair friend of the people,<br />
do not refuse those who <br />
have come so far the chance <br />
to cleanse Herot.<br />
I have heard that the monster<br />
in his recklessness uses no weapons. <br />
I, therefore, to amuse Hygelac my lord,<br />
scorn to carry sword or shield,<br />
but I shall seize my enemy<br />
in my hand grip and fight, <br />
enemy against enemy,<br />
and let God decide<br />
who shall be taken by death.<br />
I expect, if he wins, that<br />
he will eat fearlessly of<br />
the Geat people in this hall<br />
as he often has of yours.<br />
Nor will you need,<br />
if death takes me,<br />
worry about a burial&#8211;<br />
that solitary one<br />
will carry my corpse,<br />
dripping with blood,<br />
to a ruthless feast.<br />
If battle takes me,<br />
send this best of war garments,<br />
this shirt of mail,<br />
to Hygelac&#8211;it is<br />
an inheritance from Hrethel<br />
and the work of Weland.<br />
Fate always goes as it will!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hrothgar, protector of the Danes, spoke: <br />
&#8220;Because of past kindness<br />
and deeds done, you have come,<br />
my friend Beowulf. By a killing <br />
your father brought about <br />
the greatest of feuds.<br />
He was the killer of Heatholaf<br />
among the Wylfings. The Geats,<br />
for fear of war, would not have him,<br />
so he sought us Danes<br />
over the rolling waves. . .<br />
back when I first ruled,<br />
as a youth, this wide kingdom<br />
of the Danish people,<br />
this treasure city of heroes.<br />
Heorogar was dead then,<br />
my older brother,<br />
the son of Healfdene.<br />
(He was better than I!)<br />
I paid money to settle <br />
your father&#8217;s feud, sent <br />
treasure over the water&#8217;s back<br />
to the Wylfings. Your father<br />
swore oaths to me.<br />
It is a sorrow for me<br />
to say to any man<br />
what Grendel has done&#8211;<br />
humiliations in Herot&#8211;<br />
hostile attacks on my hall warriors<br />
until they are diminished,<br />
swept away in Grendel&#8217;s horror.<br />
God may easily put an end<br />
to that mad ravager&#8217;s deeds.<br />
Quite often have men boasted,<br />
over their ale-cups,<br />
drunk on beer,<br />
that they would meet<br />
Grendel&#8217;s attack in the hall<br />
with grim swords. But<br />
in the morning when the daylight <br />
shone, the mead hall was stained <br />
in gore, the hall wet with <br />
the blood of battle. And I had <br />
a few less loyal men.<br />
Sit now and feast,<br />
glory of warriors, <br />
and speak your thoughts<br />
as your heart tells you.&#8221;</p>
<p>So a bench was cleared for <br />
the Geats and the brave men <br />
sat down proud in their strength.</p>
<p>A warrior did his duty,<br />
bearing an etched cup<br />
and pouring sweet drink.<br />
The poet sang in a clear voice,<br />
and in Herot there was the joy<br />
of brave men, Danes and Geats.</p>
<p>Unferth, Ecglaf&#8217;s son,<br />
who sat at the feet <br />
of the king of the Danes,<br />
spoke, unloosing a battle-rune<br />
(The bravery of Beowulf<br />
was a vexation to him<br />
because he envied any man <br />
on this middle-earth who had<br />
more glory than himself):<br />
&#8220;Are you that Beowulf<br />
who struggled with Brecca<br />
in the broad sea<br />
in a swimming contest?<br />
The one who, out of pride,<br />
risked his life in the deep water<br />
though both friends and enemies<br />
told you it was too dangerous?<br />
Are you the one who hugged <br />
the sea, gliding through the boiling <br />
waves of the winter&#8217;s swell?<br />
You and Brecca toiled<br />
seven nights in the sea,<br />
and he, with more strength,<br />
overcame you. And <br />
in the morning the waves <br />
bore him to the Heathrames<br />
from whence he went home<br />
to the Brondings, beloved of them,<br />
to his people and mead hall.<br />
Brecca fulfilled all his boast.<br />
Because of this, though you have <br />
everywhere withstood the battle storm,<br />
I don&#8217;t expect much from you<br />
if you dare await<br />
Grendel in the night.&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Beowulf spoke: <br />
&#8220;Well, my friend Unferth, you <br />
have said a good many things <br />
about Brecca and that trip, <br />
drunk on beer as you are. <br />
Truth to tell, I had more strength <br />
but also more hardships in the waves.<br />
He and I were both boys<br />
and boasted out of our youth<br />
that we two would risk <br />
our lives in the sea.<br />
And so we did. <br />
With naked swords in hand, <br />
to ward off whales,<br />
we swam. Brecca could not<br />
out-swim me, nor could I<br />
out-distance him. And thus<br />
we were, for five nights.<br />
It was cold weather and<br />
the waves surged, driving us<br />
apart, and the North wind came<br />
like a battle in the night.<br />
Fierce were the waves <br />
and the anger of the sea fish <br />
stirred. My coat of mail,<br />
adorned in gold<br />
and locked hard by hand,<br />
helped against those foes.<br />
A hostile thing drew me<br />
to the bottom in its grim grip,<br />
but it was granted to me<br />
to reach it with my sword&#8217;s <br />
point. The battle storm <br />
destroyed that mighty <br />
sea beast through my hand. <br />
And on and on evil <br />
things threatened me.<br />
I served them with my sword<br />
as it was right to do.<br />
Those wicked things<br />
had no joy of the feast,<br />
did not sit at the sea&#8217;s <br />
bottom eating my bones.<br />
When the morning came<br />
my sword had put <br />
many to sleep, and even today<br />
in that fiord they don&#8217;t<br />
hinder seafarers. Light<br />
shone from the East,<br />
that bright beacon of God,<br />
and the seas subsided.<br />
I saw cliffs, the windy<br />
walls of the sea. <br />
Fate often saves<br />
an undoomed man if <br />
his courage holds.<br />
Anyway, with my sword<br />
I slew nine sea monsters.<br />
Nor have I heard tell <br />
of a harder fight<br />
or a more distressed man<br />
ever to go in the sea.<br />
I survived the grasp <br />
of hostiles, and the sea <br />
bore me, the surging water, <br />
weary, into the land of the Finns.<br />
I have not heard<br />
anything about you<br />
surviving such battles,<br />
such terrors of the sword.<br />
Neither Brecca nor you have <br />
performed such deeds in <br />
war sport or with shining swords.<br />
Yet I don&#8217;t boast about it.<br />
But you, your own brother&#8217;s <br />
murderer, shall be damned<br />
and burn in Hell no matter<br />
how strong your wit is.<br />
I say to you truly,<br />
son of Ecglaf, that wretch<br />
Grendel would never have done<br />
such horrors, such humiliations<br />
on you chief, if you were so<br />
fierce as you suppose.<br />
Grendel has found <br />
he need not fear feud,<br />
any sword storm,<br />
from your people.<br />
He takes his toll,<br />
showing no mercy<br />
to the Danish folk.<br />
He enjoys himself,<br />
killing and feasting,<br />
and expects no fight<br />
from the Danes.<br />
But I shall offer him<br />
the battle of a Geat in <br />
strength and courage.<br />
When I get done with him,<br />
anyone who wishes may<br />
happily go into the mead hall<br />
as morning shines<br />
on the children of men.<br />
On that day the sun<br />
will be clothed in radiance<br />
as it shines from the South!&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The giver of treasure, Hrothgar,<br />
gray-haired and brave in battle,<br />
felt glad&#8211;the chief of the Danes<br />
could count on help.<br />
That guardian of the folk<br />
heard in Beowulf firm resolution.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The men laughed, the din <br />
resounding, and the words <br />
turned friendly.<br />
Wealhtheow, Hrothgar&#8217;s queen,<br />
came forth, mindful of kin,<br />
adorned in gold to greet the men.<br />
First she gave the cup<br />
to the country&#8217;s guardian,<br />
that one dear to his people,<br />
biding joy in his beer drinking.<br />
That king famous for victories<br />
happily took the feast cup.<br />
Then that woman of the Helmings<br />
went round to each, young and old,<br />
sharing the precious cup.<br />
In proper time that ring-adorned <br />
queen excellent in mind<br />
brought the mead cup to Beowulf.<br />
She greeted him, thanking<br />
God that her wish had<br />
been fulfilled, that finally<br />
a hero had come who <br />
she could count on<br />
to stop Grendel&#8217;s crimes.</p>
<p>Beowulf, fierce in war,<br />
received the cup from Wealhtheow <br />
and spoke eagerly of battle:<br />
&#8220;I resolved when I set to sea<br />
in my boat with my warriors<br />
that I, alone, will fulfill<br />
the wish of your people. . .<br />
or die in the foe&#8217;s grasp.<br />
I shall perform the deeds<br />
of a hero or I have passed<br />
my last day in this mead hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman liked these words,<br />
this brave speech of the Geat.<br />
The gold-adorned folk queen<br />
went to sit by her lord.</p>
<p>Now again, as it had been<br />
in the old days, brave words<br />
were spoken and the people were happy.<br />
The gladness of warriors continued <br />
until the son of Healfdene<br />
wished to go to his evening rest.<br />
Hrothgar knew the wretch<br />
planned to attack the hall<br />
after the sun had set,<br />
night over the hall,<br />
when the shadows came<br />
striding dark under the clouds.</p>
<p>All the company arose.<br />
Warrior then saluted warrior,<br />
Hrothgar wishing Beowulf luck<br />
in his fight for the hall.<br />
Hrothgar said these words:<br />
&#8220;Never, since I have been able<br />
to lift shield, have I entrusted<br />
this hall, this mighty house<br />
of the Danes, to any man.<br />
But now I entrust it to you.<br />
Have and hold this best of houses.<br />
Keep fame in mind, watch <br />
against the foe, and make <br />
your valor known! You shall <br />
lack nothing if you <br />
survive this deed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Hrothgar, protector <br />
of the Danes, and his band <br />
of warriors left the hall.<br />
Hrothgar sought the queen&#8217;s bed.</p>
<p>God, as men learned,<br />
had chosen a man<br />
who could fight Grendel.<br />
The chief of the Geats, <br />
indeed, trusted his strength<br />
and God&#8217;s favor.<br />
Beowulf took off his armor,<br />
off his helmet, handed<br />
his figured sword to the attendant.<br />
Beowulf, that good man, then<br />
spoke some brave words<br />
before he got in bed:<br />
&#8220;I don&#8217;t claim myself<br />
any lower in strength or brave deeds <br />
than Grendel. Therefore, I will <br />
not kill him with a sword, <br />
though I easily might.<br />
Though he is famous for strength,<br />
he knows no weapons to cut a shield.<br />
If he chooses to forego a sword,<br />
if he dares seek me without weapon,<br />
then we two shall fight without,<br />
and wise God, that king, shall<br />
choose who shall win glory.&#8221;</p>
<p>The battle-brave one lay down then,<br />
a pillow received the warrior&#8217;s face, <br />
and his brave men sought rest<br />
around him in the hall. Not one<br />
thought he would seek home again,<br />
see his people or birthplace.<br />
Far too many Danes had already <br />
died there. But the Lord would <br />
give victory to the Geat people,<br />
helping and supporting, so that <br />
one man&#8217;s craft overcame all. <br />
(It is well known that God <br />
always rules the race of men.)</p>
