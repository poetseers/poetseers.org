				<p>Then Wealhtheow came out<br />
under a golden crown<br />
to where the good men sat,<br />
nephew and uncle (at that time <br />
there was peace between the two,<br />
each still true to the other).</p>
<p>Unferth the spokesman<br />
sat at Hrothgar&#8217;s feet&#8211;<br />
everyone considered him<br />
brave in spirit though <br />
he had not been kind to <br />
his kin at the sword&#8217;s play.</p>
<p>Spoke then the queen of the Danes:<br />
&#8220;Receive this cup,<br />
my dear lord,<br />
giver of treasure.<br />
Be in joy,<br />
gold friend of men,<br />
and speak to these Geats<br />
with kind words<br />
as men should do.<br />
Be gracious to the Geats<br />
and mindful of the gifts<br />
you have from near and far.<br />
A man said to me<br />
that he would have<br />
this warrior for a son.<br />
Herot, the bright ring hall,<br />
is purged. Give while you can<br />
many rewards and leave<br />
to your kin people and land<br />
when you must go<br />
to learn fate&#8217;s decree.<br />
I know my nephew Hrothulf<br />
will keep his honor<br />
if you, king of the Danes,<br />
leave this world earlier that he.<br />
I know Hruthulf will remember<br />
what we two wish<br />
and the kindness we showed<br />
when he was a child.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wealhtheow turned then<br />
to the bench where her sons <br />
were, Hrethric and Hrothmund,<br />
children of warriors,<br />
the youth together.<br />
There the good ones sat,<br />
Beowulf of the Geats<br />
and the two brothers.<br />
To him the cup was carried<br />
and friendship offered in words.<br />
Wound gold was kindly bestowed:<br />
two arm ornaments, shirts <br />
of mail, rings, and the largest <br />
neck ring I have heard <br />
tell of on the earth.</p>
<p>I have not heard<br />
of any greater hoard-treasures<br />
under the sky since<br />
Hama carried away<br />
to his bright fortress<br />
the necklace of the Brosings.<br />
He fled a treacherous quarrel<br />
from the king of the East Goths<br />
with the ornament and its setting,<br />
choosing everlasting gain.</p>
<p>(This is the ring Hygelac <br />
of the Geats, grandson of Swerting,<br />
uncle of Beowulf, would have near<br />
when he guarded the battle-spoil<br />
under his banner. Fate would take him <br />
when he courted trouble&#8211; <br />
out of pride&#8211;in a feud <br />
with the Frisians. He would wear <br />
those noble stones over <br />
the cup of the waves. He would<br />
fall beneath his shield. His body, <br />
his armor, and the ring also, would<br />
pass into the power of the Franks.<br />
Bad warriors rifled the corpses<br />
after the battle slaughter.<br />
The Geat people remained <br />
in the field of corpses.)</p>
<p>Music filled the hall. Wealhtheow <br />
spoke before the company:<br />
&#8220;Enjoy this neck-ring, <br />
beloved Beowulf, young hero, <br />
and use this armor, these <br />
treasures of the people.<br />
Thrive well, be known<br />
for valor, and give kind<br />
instruction to these two boys.<br />
I will remember your deeds.<br />
You have earned forever<br />
the praise of men, <br />
from near and far,<br />
even to the home of the winds<br />
and the walls of the sea.<br />
Be blessed while you live, prince!<br />
I wish you well with the treasures.<br />
Be gentle, joyful one, to my sons.<br />
In this place is each warrior<br />
true to the other, mild <br />
in spirit, an d faithful<br />
to his king. The warriors<br />
are united, the men drink<br />
deep, and they do my biding.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went to her seat.<br />
There was a choice feast,<br />
men drank wine.<br />
They did not know<br />
that grim fate<br />
would come to many nobles<br />
after evening fell<br />
and powerful Hrothgar<br />
went to his house to rest.</p>
<p>Countless warriors guarded the hall,<br />
as they had often done:<br />
they cleared the floor of benches,<br />
spread out beds and cushions.<br />
One of the beer drinkers,<br />
doomed and fated,<br />
lay on the couch.<br />
They set by their heads<br />
their war gear and bright <br />
wood shields. There on the bench <br />
over each warrior could be seen <br />
a towering helmet, ringed armor, <br />
and a huge wooden spear. <br />
Their custom was that they were <br />
always ready for war, both <br />
in the field and at home, each <br />
ready anytime his king needed him.<br />
Those were good people.</p>
<p>end of episode six</p>
<p><strong>Part Two: Grendel&#8217;s Mother<br />
&#8211;The Attack of Grendel&#8217;s Mother&#8211;</strong></p>
<p>They sank into sleep.<br />
One paid dearly for <br />
his evening&#8217;s rest,<br />
as had happened often<br />
since Grendel had come<br />
to the gold hall<br />
performing his evil<br />
until the end came to him,<br />
death after his sins.</p>
<p>It was soon learned<br />
and widely known among men<br />
that an avenger yet lived<br />
after that war-trouble:<br />
Grendel&#8217;s mother, a monster<br />
woman, she who lived in <br />
the terrible water,<br />
the cold streams, <br />
thought of her misery.</p>
<p>After Cain killed his brother,<br />
his father&#8217;s son,<br />
he went in guilt,<br />
marked by murder,<br />
fleeing the joys of men<br />
to occupy the waste land.<br />
There awoke many fated spirits,<br />
Grendel being one,<br />
that savage, hateful outcast.<br />
At Herot he found a man<br />
awake and ready for war.<br />
The monster laid hold of him,<br />
but Beowulf kept in mind his <br />
strength, the precious gift <br />
God had granted, and God gave <br />
him help and support.<br />
Thus Beowulf overcame that enemy,<br />
subdued that hellish demon.<br />
Then Grendel went,<br />
the enemy of mankind,<br />
deprived of joy,<br />
seeking his death place.</p>
<p>So his mother, greedy<br />
and gloomy as the gallows,<br />
went on a sorrowful journey<br />
to avenge her son&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>So she came to Herot where<br />
the Danes slept in the hall.<br />
The fortunes of the noble ones<br />
changed when Grendel&#8217;s mother<br />
got inside: the terror was less<br />
by just so much as<br />
is the strength of a woman,<br />
the war-horror of a woman,<br />
is less than the horror of<br />
a sword forged with hammer<br />
and stained in blood<br />
shearing the strong edges<br />
of the boar on a helmet.</p>
<p>Hard edges were drawn in the hall,<br />
swords off the benches,<br />
and many broad shields fast in hand,<br />
though they forgot about helmets<br />
and broad mail shirts when<br />
the terror seized them.</p>
<p>After they had seen her,<br />
she was in haste<br />
to get out of there<br />
and save her life.<br />
She quickly seized<br />
one of the warriors<br />
then headed back to the fens.<br />
The warrior she killed, <br />
in his sleep, was Hrothgar&#8217;s <br />
most trusted man, famous <br />
between the two seas,<br />
a glorious hero.</p>
<p>(Beowulf was not there,<br />
for after the treasure-giving<br />
the famous Geat had gone<br />
to another house.)</p>
<p>She took her son&#8217;s famous<br />
blood-covered hand.<br />
An outcry came from Herot,<br />
care had been renewed<br />
and returned to the dwelling <br />
place&#8211;that was not a good <br />
bargain, that both sides paid<br />
with the lives of friends.</p>
<p>The wise old king,<br />
the gray warrior,<br />
was in a savage mood<br />
when he heard his<br />
chief warrior was dead.<br />
Beowulf was quickly <br />
fetched to the chamber.</p>
<p>As day broke the noble champion<br />
together with his warriors<br />
went to the wise ones, the hall&#8217;s<br />
wood floors resounding.<br />
The wise ones all wondered <br />
if ever the Almighty would <br />
remove this woeful spell.</p>
<p>Beowulf asked with words<br />
if the night had been<br />
according to his desire<br />
and all things agreeable.</p>
<p>Hrothgar, protector of the Danes, spoke:<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask about happiness!<br />
Sorrow is renewed<br />
among the Danish people.<br />
Aeschere is dead, Yrmenlaf&#8217;s <br />
elder brother, my confidant, <br />
the bearer of my advice, my <br />
shoulder companion when troops <br />
clash and boar helmets smashed.<br />
As a noble prince should be,<br />
such Aeschere was!<br />
Now he has been slain<br />
in Herot by the hands<br />
of a restless, murderous spirit.<br />
I do not know where<br />
his carcass has gone<br />
to be gladly feasted on.<br />
She has avenged the feud<br />
for your violent killing <br />
with hard hand clasps<br />
of Grendel yesternight<br />
for diminishing and destroying<br />
my people for so long.<br />
Grendel fell in battle,<br />
forfeited his life, and <br />
now another has come,<br />
a mighty man-eater<br />
to avenge her kin,<br />
as is seen by many <br />
a warrior who mourns for me, <br />
treasure giver, weeping in <br />
their minds for my heavy <br />
sorrow, a hand lying lifeless <br />
who gave good things to you.<br />
I have heard tell<br />
among my people<br />
and councilors that<br />
they had seen two mighty <br />
wanderers in the waste land<br />
moors keeping guard, <br />
alien spirits. One was,<br />
as far as they could see,<br />
the likeness of a woman.<br />
The other miserable thing<br />
in the stature of a man,<br />
though he was larger<br />
than any other man,<br />
as they trod the paths of exiles.<br />
In the days of old<br />
earth dwellers called him Grendel.<br />
We have no knowledge of a father,<br />
of any forebears among evil spirits.<br />
They occupied the secret land,<br />
the wolf&#8217;s retreat&#8211;<br />
windy bluffs, perilous fens,<br />
where a waterfall<br />
darkens under bluffs<br />
and goes down under the ground.<br />
It is not far from here,<br />
by measure of miles,<br />
that the mere stands.<br />
Over it hangs a frost-covered <br />
grove, woods rooted deep-<br />
shadowing the water.<br />
There each night<br />
a portent may be seen:<br />
fire on the water.<br />
No wise one among<br />
the sons of men<br />
knows the bottom.<br />
Though the heath-stalker,<br />
the strong-horned hart,<br />
harassed by hounds, seeks <br />
the forest in his flight,<br />
he will give his life<br />
rather than protect his head<br />
by going there.<br />
That is not a good place!<br />
There water surges up,<br />
black, to the clouds,<br />
and the wind stirs up<br />
hateful weather so that<br />
the sky turns gloomy and weeps. . .<br />
Again it has happened that<br />
the remedy lies with you alone.<br />
The land, the dangerous place<br />
where you might find<br />
this criminal is unexplored.<br />
Seek it if you dare. . .<br />
For that fight I will pay<br />
as I did before with<br />
wound gold and ancient <br />
treasures. . .if you survive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, spoke:<br />
&#8220;Do not sorrow, wise king!<br />
It is better for a man<br />
to avenge a friend <br />
than mourn much. Each of us <br />
must await the end of this <br />
life. He who wishes will <br />
work for glory before death. <br />
That is best for the warrior <br />
after he is gone.<br />
Arise, guardian of the kingdom,<br />
let us go quickly<br />
to see Grendel&#8217;s kin.<br />
I promise you this:<br />
she will not escape to shelter&#8211;<br />
not into the earth&#8217;s bosom,<br />
not into the mountain&#8217;s wood,<br />
not into the sea&#8217;s bottom,<br />
go where she will!<br />
For this day, have<br />
patience in each woe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The veteran leapt up then,<br />
thanking God, the Mighty One,<br />
that the man had so spoken.</p>
