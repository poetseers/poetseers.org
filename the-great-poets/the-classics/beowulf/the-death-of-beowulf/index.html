				<p></p>
<p>The wound began<br />
to swell and burn,<br />
the venom seethed,<br />
that poison inside.<br />
The prince went<br />
to sit by the wall,<br />
the wise man sat down<br />
to look at the work <br />
of giants held within <br />
the earth-house standing <br />
on stone pillars.</p>
<p>Wiglaf bathed him,<br />
his lord,<br />
wearied in battle,<br />
and unfastened his helmet.</p>
<p>Beowulf spoke,<br />
despite his wounds.<br />
(He knew well<br />
he&#8217;d seen the last<br />
of this world&#8217;s joys,<br />
that he&#8217;d numbered<br />
his last day.)<br />
&#8220;Now should I give my sons<br />
my battle garments,<br />
but fate did not grant<br />
that I have sons.<br />
I ruled the people<br />
fifty winters.<br />
Not one king among <br />
the neighboring peoples<br />
dared greet me<br />
with a sword;<br />
I feared no one.<br />
I awaited my destiny well:<br />
never did I plot a quarrel,<br />
never did I swear<br />
an unjust oath.<br />
I take joy in this,<br />
despite a mortal wound.<br />
The Ruler of Mankind<br />
will not charge<br />
that I murdered a kinsman<br />
when my life<br />
departs this body.<br />
Go quickly, Wiglaf,<br />
examine the hoard<br />
under the gray stone<br />
now that the dragon lies<br />
sleeping of a wound,<br />
bereft of his treasure.<br />
Be in haste<br />
so that I may see<br />
the ancient treasure,<br />
may examine<br />
the curious gems,<br />
so that I may<br />
more cheerfully give up<br />
my life and country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wiglaf hurried<br />
from his wounded lord,<br />
obeyed the battle-sick one,<br />
rushed in his mail<br />
under the cave&#8217;s roof.<br />
There by a seat<br />
the brave young man saw<br />
many precious jewels,<br />
shining gold on the ground,<br />
and works of art<br />
on the walls.<br />
There in the dragon&#8217;s den<br />
Wiglaf saw the cups<br />
of ancient men,<br />
ornaments fallen.<br />
There were helmets,<br />
old and rusty,<br />
and many arm-rings<br />
twisted with skill.<br />
(Treasure, gold in <br />
the ground, may be easily<br />
seized by any man,<br />
hide it who will.)</p>
<p>Wiglaf saw a standard<br />
all golden high <br />
over the treasure,<br />
the greatest of hand-wonders,<br />
woven with the skill of hands.<br />
From it a light shone,<br />
lit all the ground<br />
so he could look<br />
over all the treasures.<br />
Then, I have heard,<br />
he rifled the hoard and<br />
into his bosom loaded<br />
the ancient work of giants&#8211;<br />
goblets and dishes,<br />
whatever he chose,<br />
even the golden standard.<br />
The sword, the iron edge,<br />
had carried off<br />
the guardian who<br />
for a long while<br />
carried surging fire<br />
in the middle of the sky.</p>
<p>Wiglaf was in haste,<br />
eager to return<br />
with these great treasures;<br />
he feared the great spirit<br />
might be dead<br />
in the place where he lay.<br />
With the treasure<br />
in his hands<br />
he found his lord<br />
bloody and weak.<br />
He bathed Beowulf<br />
until he could speak,<br />
until words broke<br />
from his breast-hoard.</p>
<p>The king, aged in sorrow,<br />
beheld the gold and spoke:<br />
&#8220;I thank the Wonder-King,<br />
the Ruler of All,<br />
that I could win this<br />
for my people<br />
before my death-day.<br />
I have traded<br />
my old life for <br />
the people&#8217;s needs.<br />
I cannot remain.<br />
Bid my warriors<br />
raise a splendid mound<br />
on the shore-cliffs<br />
after my funeral fire<br />
that a remembrance shall<br />
tower high on Hronesness.<br />
Sea-farers shall afterward<br />
call it Beowulf&#8217;s Mound<br />
when they pilot ships<br />
far over the ocean&#8217;s mists.&#8221;</p>
<p>He unfastened from his neck,<br />
his golden necklace, gave it<br />
to the brave young warrior,<br />
and a gold-trimmed helmet,<br />
a ring, and mail.<br />
He bid him use them well.<br />
&#8220;You are the last<br />
remnant of our kin,<br />
of the Waegmundings.<br />
Fate has swept<br />
the rest away,<br />
those courageous warriors.<br />
I follow them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those were the aged king&#8217;s <br />
last words, thoughts from <br />
the heart, before he tasted<br />
the funeral-fire,<br />
that hot, hostile flame.<br />
His heart departed, his soul,<br />
to seek glory.</p>
<p><b>Wiglaf Speaks to the Cowards</b></p>
<p>The young man looked<br />
on his beloved lord,<br />
wretchedly killed,<br />
lying on the ground.<br />
His killer, the terrible <br />
cave-dragon, also lay <br />
bereft of life, overwhelmed <br />
in destruction.<br />
The dragon no longer<br />
coiled round the hoard,<br />
but was taken by iron,<br />
hacked in battle<br />
by the hammer&#8217;s creation.<br />
He had fallen<br />
on the ground<br />
near his treasure house.<br />
No longer would he circle<br />
at midnight<br />
proud in his flames;<br />
he had fallen<br />
before the prince&#8217;s<br />
hand-work.</p>
<p>As far as I have heard<br />
no man ever prospered<br />
rushing against that enemy;<br />
no man ever prospered<br />
who found that dragon awake.<br />
Beowulf bought the treasures<br />
with his life.<br />
Both of them found<br />
the end of this life.</p>
<p>Soon the cowards,<br />
the ten warriors,<br />
returned from the woods,<br />
those who did not dare<br />
fight with spears<br />
when their lord<br />
needed help.<br />
They carried their shields,<br />
wore their mail,<br />
in shame<br />
to where Wiglaf sat,<br />
near his lord&#8217;s shoulder<br />
trying to wake him<br />
with water.<br />
He did not succeed&#8211;<br />
he could not,<br />
though he much wished it,<br />
hold his chief in life.<br />
He could not change<br />
the will of God.</p>
<p>The young man<br />
gave a grim welcome<br />
to those who had <br />
lost courage. Wiglaf spoke,<br />
glaring at the hated ones:<br />
&#8220;Lo, this will he say<br />
who wishes to speak the truth:<br />
that lord of men<br />
gave you treasures,<br />
the war-equipment<br />
you stand in.<br />
At the ale-bench<br />
he often gave you. . .<br />
hall-sitters. . .<br />
helmets and armor, <br />
the most splendid<br />
he could find,<br />
far or near.<br />
He completely<br />
wasted that armor.<br />
When war came<br />
he couldn&#8217;t boast<br />
of warriors.<br />
Still, God granted<br />
victory to him<br />
that he alone avenged<br />
himself with sword<br />
when he needed help.<br />
I could do little in battle,<br />
though I undertook it.<br />
It was beyond my measure.<br />
But I struck the foe<br />
and fire gushed less<br />
strongly from his head.<br />
There were too few men <br />
around the prince<br />
when he faced<br />
his time of need.<br />
Now shall the treasure,<br />
the sword gifts<br />
and delightful homes<br />
given to your people,<br />
cease. You will lose <br />
your land rights<br />
when men far and wide<br />
hear of your flight,<br />
your shameful doings.<br />
Death is better<br />
to any man<br />
than a life of disgrace.&#8221;</p>
<p>He commanded then<br />
that the battle-deeds<br />
be announced<br />
to those in town,<br />
up over the cliff-side<br />
where the other warriors<br />
the whole morning<br />
had waited,<br />
sad in heart,<br />
for their lord&#8217;s return<br />
or news of his death.</p>
<p><b>The Messenger Tells of Beowulf&#8217;s Death and of the Feud Which Will Now Be Renewed</b></p>
<p>The messenger was not silent<br />
but said truly<br />
to all who heard:<br />
&#8220;Now is the joy-giver<br />
of the Geat people<br />
still on his death-bed,<br />
his slaughter-couch, <br />
through the deeds<br />
of the dragon.<br />
Beside him lies<br />
his life-enemy, sick<br />
from a dagger wound.<br />
His sword could not<br />
in any way<br />
wound the monster.<br />
Wiglaf, son of Weohstan,<br />
sits by Beowulf, one <br />
warrior by another,<br />
in the death-watch.<br />
Now may the people<br />
expect a time of war<br />
when the Franks and Frisians<br />
learn of our king&#8217;s fall.<br />
A hard quarrel was made<br />
with the Hugas<br />
when Hygelac went<br />
traveling in ships<br />
to the land of the Frisians,<br />
attacked the Hetware.<br />
With a larger army they <br />
brought down that warrior;<br />
he fell among his troops.<br />
He gave no gifts<br />
to his warriors.<br />
Since then the Mereovingians<br />
have given us no kindness.<br />
Nor do I expect <br />
kindness from the Swedes&#8211;<br />
it is widely known<br />
that Haethcyn, son of Hrethel,<br />
wounded Ongentheow<br />
near Ravenswood<br />
when the Geats<br />
arrogantly sought<br />
war against the Swedes.<br />
Quickly Ongentheow,<br />
old and terrible,<br />
gave a counterblow,<br />
cut down Haethcyn<br />
and rescued his wife,<br />
that aged woman,<br />
bereft of her gold,<br />
the mother of Onela and Ohthere.<br />
Ongentheow pursued<br />
his enemies&#8211;<br />
lordless they escaped<br />
into Ravenswood,<br />
and those survivors,<br />
weary with wounds,<br />
were besieged<br />
by a huge army.<br />
Often through the night<br />
that wretched band<br />
heard threats,<br />
how in the morning<br />
he would,<br />
with the sword,<br />
cut them open,<br />
or hang them from trees,<br />
a sport for birds.<br />
Help came to them<br />
with the early dawn<br />
when Hygelac<br />
sounded his trumpet,<br />
came up the road<br />
with picked warriors.<br />
The bloody tracks were widely<br />
seen, the bloody feud<br />
between Geats and Swedes.<br />
Ongentheow was forced<br />
to seek higher ground,<br />
the old man<br />
with his kinsmen&#8211;<br />
he quickly learned<br />
of Hygelac&#8217;s war,<br />
did not believe<br />
he could not withstand<br />
the war of the sailors.<br />
The old man retreated<br />
with his children and wife<br />
behind an earth-wall.<br />
Hygelac attacked the refuge,<br />
overran the enclosure.<br />
There was Ongentheow,<br />
gray-haired, brought to bay<br />
with the edges of swords.<br />
He was forced to submit<br />
to the judgement of Eofor.<br />
Wulf hit him angrily,<br />
struck him with sword<br />
so that blood sprang<br />
out of his veins,<br />
out under his hair.<br />
But that old man<br />
was not daunted&#8211;<br />
he quickly repaid<br />
that blow with a harder,<br />
nor could Wulf<br />
return the blow,<br />
for Ongentheow had<br />
sheared his helmet<br />
so that Wulf bowed<br />
to the earth,<br />
covered with blood.<br />
(He was hurt, though not yet doomed.)<br />
As his brother lay,<br />
Eofor, with his broad sword,<br />
an ancient sword<br />
made by giants,<br />
broke Ongentheow&#8217;s helmet.<br />
That king, shepherd of his people,<br />
bowed, mortally wounded.<br />
Wulf was bound up. They<br />
controlled the slaughter-place.<br />
One warrior plundered another.<br />
They took from Ongentheow<br />
his iron mail,<br />
his hard sword,<br />
and his helmet also.<br />
They carried<br />
the old man&#8217;s armor<br />
to Hygelac.<br />
He received these weapons<br />
and promised treasures<br />
to his people,<br />
which he fulfilled,<br />
paying Wulf and Eofor<br />
for the storm of battle&#8211;<br />
gave them both<br />
land and treasures.<br />
Nor should any man<br />
throughout this world<br />
reproach those gifts&#8211;<br />
they were earned in war.<br />
And to Eofor<br />
Hygelac gave<br />
his only daughter<br />
as a pledge<br />
of friendship.<br />
That is the feud,<br />
the deadly hostility<br />
for which I expect<br />
the Swedes will attack<br />
when they learn our lord<br />
who long protected<br />
over hoard and kingdom,<br />
is dead.<br />
That most valiant of warriors<br />
will no longer look after<br />
the needs of our people,<br />
will do no more<br />
heroic deeds.<br />
Now should we hurry<br />
to see our king<br />
and bring him back<br />
to a funeral pyre.<br />
Not a little will melt<br />
with that bold man,<br />
but a huge treasure, <br />
countless wealth,<br />
bought with grimness<br />
by that brave man.<br />
All that the flames will eat,<br />
the fire embrace;<br />
no warrior will carry<br />
any of it as a token,<br />
no beautiful woman<br />
will wear a neck-ring,<br />
but, bereft of gold<br />
they shall walk<br />
in a foreign country<br />
now that our lord has forgotten<br />
laughter and joy.<br />
Now shall the spear be <br />
raised, clasped in hands,<br />
many a cold morning;<br />
now no sound of harp<br />
shall wake the warrior,<br />
but the voice<br />
of the dark raven,<br />
eager over the doomed,<br />
speaking to the eagle<br />
of how the meals are,<br />
how he rifles corpses<br />
beside the wolf.&#8221;<br />
Thus the valiant warrior<br />
spoke grievous words.<br />
And he was not much wrong.</p>
<p><b>The Funeral</b></p>
<p>The sad troops rose,<br />
went in tears<br />
below Earnaness<br />
to view the wonder.<br />
Lifeless on the sand,<br />
held in his rest-bed,<br />
was the man who had <br />
given them treasures.<br />
That was the last day<br />
of the prince of the Geats;<br />
he died a wondrous death.</p>
<p>There too on the ground<br />
was the strange thing,<br />
the hateful dead dragon,<br />
the fire-thrower,<br />
in his horrible colors,<br />
scorched by flames.<br />
He measured fifty feet,<br />
he who had<br />
joyed in the sky,<br />
flown at night,<br />
then hidden in his lair.<br />
But he&#8217;d made his last<br />
use of caverns&#8211;<br />
death held him fast.</p>
<p>Beside him lay<br />
cups and pitchers,<br />
dishes and swords<br />
eaten through with rust<br />
as if the earth had embraced<br />
them a thousand winters.<br />
That was a hoard<br />
of great power,<br />
that gold<br />
ancient men<br />
had encircled with a spell<br />
so that no man<br />
could touch it,<br />
unless God himself,<br />
the great Truth-King,<br />
gave leave<br />
to whichever man<br />
seemed fit to Him.<br />
But it was plain<br />
that nothing had gone well<br />
for him who had,<br />
unrightly, hidden those<br />
works of art<br />
under that roof.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mystery where<br />
a good man goes<br />
when he reaches his end,<br />
when he can no longer<br />
live in the houses of men.<br />
So it was with Beowulf<br />
after he&#8217;d sought<br />
the keeper of the cave.<br />
He himself couldn&#8217;t know<br />
how he would leave the world.<br />
The famous kings who had cursed <br />
that treasure deeply<br />
damned him who plundered it<br />
into eternal heathen shrines,<br />
the solid bond of Hell.<br />
But Beowulf did not<br />
look on it in greed.</p>
<p>Wiglaf spoke, Weohstan&#8217;s son:<br />
&#8220;Often must a warrior<br />
suffer for another&#8217;s mistake,<br />
as has happened here.<br />
Nor could we convince<br />
our beloved prince<br />
that he should not attack<br />
that gold-keeper<br />
but let him lie<br />
alone in his cave<br />
until the world&#8217;s end.<br />
He grasped<br />
his high fate&#8211;<br />
the hoard is open,<br />
grimly bought.<br />
That fate<br />
was too cruel<br />
to which our king<br />
was impelled.<br />
I went inside,<br />
saw all the treasure,<br />
the precious things;<br />
I didn&#8217;t enter<br />
in a friendly way.<br />
I hastily grasped<br />
many things in my hands,<br />
carried out many<br />
of the hoarded treasures<br />
to my lord.<br />
He was alive still,<br />
sound in mind;<br />
that aged man<br />
sorrowfully said<br />
many things:<br />
He wanted you to build<br />
on the site of his pyre<br />
a high mound,<br />
great and glorious,<br />
since he was<br />
among warriors<br />
the most magnificent,<br />
famous throughout the world.<br />
We should now hasten<br />
to see the curious gems,<br />
the wonders under the earth.<br />
I will show you the way.<br />
Make the pyre ready<br />
so that we may bring our lord<br />
to the place<br />
he will abide<br />
in the keeping<br />
of the All-Powerful.&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Wiglaf ordered<br />
the brave warriors<br />
to carry wood<br />
from far and wide<br />
to the funeral pyre<br />
for the great leader<br />
of the people.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&#8220;Now shall fire eat,<br />
the flourishing dark flames,<br />
the ruler of warriors,<br />
he who often braved<br />
the rain of iron,<br />
the storming of arrows<br />
hard from bows,<br />
the sturdy shaft<br />
swift on feathered wings.&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Wiglaf called seven warriors,<br />
the very best,<br />
and made the eighth himself,<br />
to go under<br />
that evil roof.<br />
One carried a torch.<br />
No man needed forcing<br />
when he saw that great treasure<br />
rusting without guardian.<br />
None mourned<br />
carrying that off,<br />
and they shoved the dragon<br />
over the cliff&#8211;<br />
the waves embraced<br />
that treasure guardian.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Then the twisted gold,<br />
treasure uncountable,<br />
was lain in a wagon;<br />
they carried the gray warrior<br />
to Hronesness.<br />
For him then<br />
they prepared<br />
a huge funeral pyre<br />
on the earth,<br />
hung with helmets,<br />
war-shields,<br />
and bright coats of mail,<br />
as Beowulf had asked.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There they laid<br />
the famous prince<br />
and lamented<br />
that beloved lord.<br />
Warriors then built<br />
the greatest of fires.<br />
Wood-smoke ascended,<br />
dark black over the flames.<br />
That roar wrapped around <br />
sorrowful weeping.<br />
The wind stood still.<br />
Then his bone-house broke,<br />
the heart burned.</p>
<p>Beowulf&#8217;s queen uttered <br />
a mournful song, spoke <br />
her heart&#8217;s care with her hair <br />
bound tight. She told earnestly<br />
how she feared evil days,<br />
a great slaughter of warriors,<br />
humiliation and captivity.<br />
Heaven swallowed the smoke.</p>
<p>The Geats built a mound then,<br />
in ten days, high and broad <br />
on the hill, a beacon<br />
for the warrior<br />
widely seen by sailors.<br />
They surrounded the ashes<br />
by a wall, as splendid<br />
as the cleverest<br />
men could make.<br />
In the mound they placed<br />
rings and bracelets<br />
and all such things as<br />
they&#8217;d found in the hoard.<br />
They left that treasure<br />
in the hands of the earth,<br />
as it lies still,<br />
as useless to men<br />
as it had been before.</p>
<p>Then twelve warriors<br />
rode round the grave<br />
speaking their sorrow,<br />
reciting praises<br />
for their lord&#8217;s<br />
courageous deeds.<br />
(A warrior should do so<br />
when his lord dies.)</p>
<p>Thus the Geats<br />
mourned their great lord,<br />
saying he was,<br />
among this world&#8217;s kings,<br />
the mildest, the gentlest,<br />
the kindest to his people,<br />
and the most eager<br />
for eternal fame.</p>
