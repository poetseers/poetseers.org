				<p>VII<br />
SPIRIT<br />
&#8216;I was an infant when my mother went<br />
To see an atheist burned. She took me there.<br />
The dark-robed priests were met around the pile;<br />
The multitude was gazing silently;<br />
And as the culprit passed with dauntless mien,<br />
Tempered disdain in his unaltering eye,<br />
Mixed with a quiet smile, shone calmly forth;<br />
The thirsty fire crept round his manly limbs;<br />
His resolute eyes were scorched to blindness soon;<br />
His death-pang rent my heart! the insensate mob 10<br />
Uttered a cry of triumph, and I wept.<br />
&#8220;Weep not, child!&#8221; cried my mother, &#8220;for that man<br />
Has said, There is no God.&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p>FAIRY<br />
&#8216;There is no God!<br />
Nature confirms the faith his death-groan sealed.<br />
Let heaven and earth, let man&#8217;s revolving race,<br />
His ceaseless generations, tell their tale;<br />
Let every part depending on the chain<br />
That links it to the whole, point to the hand<br />
That grasps its term! Let every seed that falls<br />
In silent eloquence unfold its store 20<br />
Of argument; infinity within,<br />
Infinity without, belie creation;<br />
The exterminable spirit it contains<br />
Is Nature&#8217;s only God; but human pride<br />
Is skilful to invent most serious names<br />
To hide its ignorance.<br />
&#8216;The name of God<br />
Has fenced about all crime with holiness,<br />
Himself the creature of his worshippers,<br />
Whose names and attributes and passions change,<br />
Seeva, Buddh, Foh, Jehovah, God, or Lord, 30<br />
Even with the human dupes who build his shrines,<br />
Still serving o&#8217;er the war-polluted world<br />
For desolation&#8217;s watchword; whether hosts<br />
Stain his death-blushing chariot-wheels, as on<br />
Triumphantly they roll, whilst Brahmins raise<br />
A sacred hymn to mingle with the groans;<br />
Or countless partners of his power divide<br />
His tyranny to weakness; or the smoke<br />
Of burning towns, the cries of female helplessness,<br />
Unarmed old age, and youth, and infancy, 40<br />
Horribly massacred, ascend to heaven<br />
In honor of his name; or, last and worst,<br />
Earth groans beneath religion&#8217;s iron age,<br />
And priests dare babble of a God of peace,<br />
Even whilst their hands are red with guiltless blood,<br />
Murdering the while, uprooting every germ<br />
Of truth, exterminating, spoiling all,<br />
Making the earth a slaughter-house!</p>
<p>&#8216;O Spirit! through the sense<br />
By which thy inner nature was apprised 50<br />
Of outward shows, vague dreams have rolled,<br />
And varied reminiscences have waked<br />
Tablets that never fade;<br />
All things have been imprinted there,<br />
The stars, the sea, the earth, the sky,<br />
Even the unshapeliest lineaments<br />
Of wild and fleeting visions<br />
Have left a record there<br />
To testify of earth.</p>
<p>&#8216;These are my empire, for to me is given 60<br />
The wonders of the human world to keep,<br />
And fancy&#8217;s thin creations to endow<br />
With manner, being and reality;<br />
Therefore a wondrous phantom from the dreams<br />
Of human error&#8217;s dense and purblind faith<br />
I will evoke, to meet thy questioning.<br />
Ahasuerus, rise!&#8217;</p>
<p>A strange and woe-worn wight<br />
Arose beside the battlement,<br />
And stood unmoving there. 70<br />
His inessential figure cast no shade<br />
Upon the golden floor;<br />
His port and mien bore mark of many years,<br />
And chronicles of untold ancientness<br />
Were legible within his beamless eye;<br />
Yet his cheek bore the mark of youth;<br />
Freshness and vigor knit his manly frame;<br />
The wisdom of old age was mingled there<br />
With youth&#8217;s primeval dauntlessness;<br />
And inexpressible woe, 80<br />
Chastened by fearless resignation, gave<br />
An awful grace to his all-speaking brow.</p>
<p>SPIRIT<br />
&#8216;Is there a God?&#8217;</p>
<p>AHASUERUS<br />
&#8216;Is there a God!&#8211;ay, an almighty God,<br />
And vengeful as almighty! Once his voice<br />
Was heard on earth; earth shuddered at the sound;<br />
The fiery-visaged firmament expressed<br />
Abhorrence, and the grave of Nature yawned<br />
To swallow all the dauntless and the good<br />
That dared to hurl defiance at his throne, 90<br />
Girt as it was with power. None but slaves<br />
Survived,&#8211;cold-blooded slaves, who did the work<br />
Of tyrannous omnipotence; whose souls<br />
No honest indignation ever urged<br />
To elevated daring, to one deed<br />
Which gross and sensual self did not pollute.<br />
These slaves built temples for the omnipotent fiend,<br />
Gorgeous and vast; the costly altars smoked<br />
With human blood, and hideous p&aelig;ans rung<br />
Through all the long-drawn aisles. A murderer heard 100<br />
His voice in Egypt, one whose gifts and arts<br />
Had raised him to his eminence in power,<br />
Accomplice of omnipotence in crime<br />
And confidant of the all-knowing one.<br />
These were Jehovah&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>&#8216;&#8221;From an eternity of idleness<br />
I, God, awoke; in seven days&#8217; toil made earth<br />
From nothing; rested, and created man;<br />
I placed him in a paradise, and there<br />
Planted the tree of evil, so that he 110<br />
Might eat and perish, and my soul procure<br />
Wherewith to sate its malice and to turn,<br />
Even like a heartless conqueror of the earth,<br />
All misery to my fame. The race of men,<br />
Chosen to my honor, with impunity<br />
May sate the lusts I planted in their heart.<br />
Here I command thee hence to lead them on,<br />
Until with hardened feet their conquering troops<br />
Wade on the promised soil through woman&#8217;s blood,<br />
And make my name be dreaded through the land. 120<br />
Yet ever-burning flame and ceaseless woe<br />
Shall be the doom of their eternal souls,<br />
With every soul on this ungrateful earth,<br />
Virtuous or vicious, weak or strong,&#8211;even all<br />
Shall perish, to fulfil the blind revenge<br />
(Which you, to men, call justice) of their God.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;The murderer&#8217;s brow<br />
Quivered with horror.</p>
<p>&#8216;&#8221;God omnipotent,<br />
Is there no mercy? must our punishment<br />
Be endless? will long ages roll away, 130<br />
And see no term? Oh! wherefore hast thou made<br />
In mockery and wrath this evil earth?<br />
Mercy becomes the powerful&#8211;be but just!<br />
O God! repent and save!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;&#8221;One way remains:<br />
I will beget a son and he shall bear<br />
The sins of all the world; he shall arise<br />
In an unnoticed corner of the earth,<br />
And there shall die upon a cross, and purge<br />
The universal crime; so that the few<br />
On whom my grace descends, those who are marked 140<br />
As vessels to the honor of their God,<br />
May credit this strange sacrifice and save<br />
Their souls alive. Millions shall live and die,<br />
Who ne&#8217;er shall call upon their Saviour&#8217;s name,<br />
But, unredeemed, go to the gaping grave,<br />
Thousands shall deem it an old woman&#8217;s tale,<br />
Such as the nurses frighten babes withal;<br />
These in a gulf of anguish and of flame<br />
Shall curse their reprobation endlessly,<br />
Yet tenfold pangs shall force them to avow, 150<br />
Even on their beds of torment where they howl,<br />
My honor and the justice of their doom.<br />
What then avail their virtuous deeds, their thoughts<br />
Of purity, with radiant genius bright<br />
Or lit with human reason&#8217;s earthly ray?<br />
Many are called, but few will I elect.<br />
Do thou my bidding, Moses!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Even the murderer&#8217;s cheek<br />
Was blanched with horror, and his quivering lips<br />
Scarce faintly uttered&#8211;&#8221;O almighty one,<br />
I tremble and obey!&#8221; 160</p>
<p>&#8216;O Spirit! centuries have set their seal<br />
On this heart of many wounds, and loaded brain,<br />
Since the Incarnate came; humbly he came,<br />
Veiling his horrible Godhead in the shape<br />
Of man, scorned by the world, his name unheard<br />
Save by the rabble of his native town,<br />
Even as a parish demagogue. He led<br />
The crowd; he taught them justice, truth and peace,<br />
In semblance; but he lit within their souls<br />
The quenchless flames of zeal, and blessed the sword 170<br />
He brought on earth to satiate with the blood<br />
Of truth and freedom his malignant soul<br />
At length his mortal frame was led to death.<br />
I stood beside him; on the torturing cross<br />
No pain assailed his unterrestrial sense;<br />
And yet he groaned. Indignantly I summed<br />
The massacres and miseries which his name<br />
Had sanctioned in my country, and I cried,<br />
&#8220;Go! go!&#8221; in mockery.<br />
A smile of godlike malice reillumined 180<br />
His fading lineaments. &#8220;I go,&#8221; he cried,<br />
&#8220;But thou shalt wander o&#8217;er the unquiet earth<br />
Eternally.&#8221; The dampness of the grave<br />
Bathed my imperishable front. I fell,<br />
And long lay tranced upon the charm&egrave;d soil.<br />
When I awoke hell burned within my brain<br />
Which staggered on its seat; for all around<br />
The mouldering relics of my kindred lay,<br />
Even as the Almighty&#8217;s ire arrested them,<br />
And in their various attitudes of death 190<br />
My murdered children&#8217;s mute and eyeless skulls<br />
Glared ghastily upon me.</p>
<p>But my soul,<br />
From sight and sense of the polluting woe<br />
Of tyranny, had long learned to prefer<br />
Hell&#8217;s freedom to the servitude of heaven.<br />
Therefore I rose, and dauntlessly began<br />
My lonely and unending pilgrimage,<br />
Resolved to wage unweariable war<br />
With my almighty tyrant and to hurl<br />
Defiance at his impotence to harm 200<br />
Beyond the curse I bore. The very hand,<br />
That barred my passage to the peaceful grave,<br />
Has crushed the earth to misery, and given<br />
Its empire to the chosen of his slaves.<br />
These I have seen, even from the earliest dawn<br />
Of weak, unstable and precarious power,<br />
Then preaching peace, as now they practise war;<br />
So, when they turned but from the massacre<br />
Of unoffending infidels to quench<br />
Their thirst for ruin in the very blood 210<br />
That flowed in their own veins, and pitiless zeal<br />
Froze every human feeling as the wife<br />
Sheathed in her husband&#8217;s heart the sacred steel,<br />
Even whilst its hopes were dreaming of her love;<br />
And friends to friends, brothers to brothers stood<br />
Opposed in bloodiest battle-field, and war,<br />
Scarce satiable by fate&#8217;s last death-draught, waged,<br />
Drunk from the wine-press of the Almighty&#8217;s wrath;<br />
Whilst the red cross, in mockery of peace,<br />
Pointed to victory! When the fray was done, 220<br />
No remnant of the exterminated faith<br />
Survived to tell its ruin, but the flesh,<br />
With putrid smoke poisoning the atmosphere,<br />
That rotted on the half-extinguished pile.</p>
<p>&#8216;Yes! I have seen God&#8217;s worshippers unsheathe<br />
The sword of his revenge, when grace descended,<br />
Confirming all unnatural impulses,<br />
To sanctify their desolating deeds;<br />
And frantic priests waved the ill-omened cross<br />
O&#8217;er the unhappy earth; then shone the sun 230<br />
On showers of gore from the upflashing steel<br />
Of safe assassination, and all crime<br />
Made stingless by the spirits of the Lord,<br />
And blood-red rainbows canopied the land.</p>
<p>&#8216;Spirit! no year of my eventful being<br />
Has passed unstained by crime and misery,<br />
Which flows from God&#8217;s own faith. I &#8216;ve marked his slaves<br />
With tongues, whose lies are venomous, beguile<br />
The insensate mob, and, whilst one hand was red<br />
With murder, feign to stretch the other out 240<br />
For brotherhood and peace; and that they now<br />
Babble of love and mercy, whilst their deeds<br />
Are marked with all the narrowness and crime<br />
That freedom&#8217;s young arm dare not yet chastise,<br />
Reason may claim our gratitude, who now,<br />
Establishing the imperishable throne<br />
Of truth and stubborn virtue, maketh vain<br />
The unprevailing malice of my foe,<br />
Whose bootless rage heaps torments for the brave,<br />
Adds impotent eternities to pain, 250<br />
Whilst keenest disappointment racks his breast<br />
To see the smiles of peace around them play,<br />
To frustrate or to sanctify their doom.</p>
<p>&#8216;Thus have I stood,&#8211;through a wild waste of years<br />
Struggling with whirlwinds of mad agony,<br />
Yet peaceful, and serene, and self-enshrined,<br />
Mocking my powerless tyrant&#8217;s horrible curse<br />
With stubborn and unalterable will,<br />
Even as a giant oak, which heaven&#8217;s fierce flame<br />
Had scath&egrave;d in the wilderness, to stand 260<br />
A monument of fadeless ruin there;<br />
Yet peacefully and movelessly it braves<br />
The midnight conflict of the wintry storm,<br />
As in the sunlight&#8217;s calm it spreads<br />
Its worn and withered arms on high<br />
To meet the quiet of a summer&#8217;s noon.&#8217;</p>
<p>The Fairy waved her wand;<br />
Ahasuerus fled<br />
Fast as the shapes of mingled shade and mist,<br />
That lurk in the glens of a twilight grove, 270<br />
Flee from the morning beam;&#8211;<br />
The matter of which dreams are made<br />
Not more endowed with actual life<br />
Than this phantasmal portraiture<br />
Of wandering human thought.</p>
