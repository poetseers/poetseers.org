				<p>VIII<br />
THE FAIRY<br />
&#8216;The present and the past thou hast beheld.<br />
It was a desolate sight. Now, Spirit, learn,<br />
The secrets of the future.&#8211;Time!<br />
Unfold the brooding pinion of thy gloom,<br />
Render thou up thy half-devoured babes,<br />
And from the cradles of eternity,<br />
Where millions lie lulled to their portioned sleep<br />
By the deep murmuring stream of passing things,<br />
Tear thou that gloomy shroud.&#8211;Spirit, behold<br />
Thy glorious destiny!&#8217;</p>
<p>Joy to the Spirit came.<br />
Through the wide rent in Time&#8217;s eternal veil,<br />
Hope was seen beaming through the mists of fear;<br />
Earth was no longer hell;<br />
Love, freedom, health had given<br />
Their ripeness to the manhood of its prime,<br />
And all its pulses beat<br />
Symphonious to the planetary spheres;<br />
Then dulcet music swelled<br />
Concordant with the life-strings of the soul; 20<br />
It throbbed in sweet and languid beatings there,<br />
Catching new life from transitory death;<br />
Like the vague sighings of a wind at even<br />
That wakes the wavelets of the slumbering sea<br />
And dies on the creation of its breath,<br />
And sinks and rises, falls and swells by fits,<br />
Was the pure stream of feeling<br />
That sprung from these sweet notes,<br />
And o&#8217;er the Spirit&#8217;s human sympathies<br />
With mild and gentle motion calmly flowed. 30</p>
<p>Joy to the Spirit came,&#8211;<br />
Such joy as when a lover sees<br />
The chosen of his soul in happiness<br />
And witnesses her peace<br />
Whose woe to him were bitterer than death;<br />
Sees her unfaded cheek<br />
Glow mantling in first luxury of health,<br />
Thrills with her lovely eyes,<br />
Which like two stars amid the heaving main<br />
Sparkle through liquid bliss. 40</p>
<p>Then in her triumph spoke the Fairy Queen:<br />
&#8216;I will not call the ghost of ages gone<br />
To unfold the frightful secrets of its lore;<br />
The present now is past,<br />
And those events that desolate the earth<br />
Have faded from the memory of Time,<br />
Who dares not give reality to that<br />
Whose being I annul. To me is given<br />
The wonders of the human world to keep,<br />
Space, matter, time and mind. Futurity 50<br />
Exposes now its treasure; let the sight<br />
Renew and strengthen all thy failing hope.<br />
O human Spirit! spur thee to the goal<br />
Where virtue fixes universal peace,<br />
And, &#8216;midst the ebb and flow of human things,<br />
Show somewhat stable, somewhat certain still,<br />
A light-house o&#8217;er the wild of dreary waves.</p>
<p>&#8216;The habitable earth is full of bliss;<br />
Those wastes of frozen billows that were hurled<br />
By everlasting snow-storms round the poles, 60<br />
Where matter dared not vegetate or live,<br />
But ceaseless frost round the vast solitude<br />
Bound its broad zone of stillness, are unloosed;<br />
And fragrant zephyrs there from spicy isles<br />
Ruffle the placid ocean-deep, that rolls<br />
Its broad, bright surges to the sloping sand,<br />
Whose roar is wakened into echoings sweet<br />
To murmur through the heaven-breathing groves<br />
And melodize with man&#8217;s blest nature there.</p>
<p>&#8216;Those deserts of immeasurable sand, 70<br />
Whose age-collected fervors scarce allowed<br />
A bird to live, a blade of grass to spring,<br />
Where the shrill chirp of the green lizard&#8217;s love<br />
Broke on the sultry silentness alone,<br />
Now teem with countless rills and shady woods,<br />
Cornfields and pastures and white cottages;<br />
And where the startled wilderness beheld<br />
A savage conqueror stained in kindred blood,<br />
A tigress sating with the flesh of lambs<br />
The unnatural famine of her toothless cubs, 80<br />
Whilst shouts and howlings through the desert rang,&#8211;<br />
Sloping and smooth the daisy-spangled lawn,<br />
Offering sweet incense to the sunrise, smiles<br />
To see a babe before his mother&#8217;s door,<br />
Sharing his morning&#8217;s meal<br />
With the green and golden basilisk<br />
That comes to lick his feet.</p>
<p>&#8216;Those trackless deeps, where many a weary sail<br />
Has seen above the illimitable plain<br />
Morning on night and night on morning rise, 90<br />
Whilst still no land to greet the wanderer spread<br />
Its shadowy mountains on the sun-bright sea,<br />
Where the loud roarings of the tempest-waves<br />
So long have mingled with the gusty wind<br />
In melancholy loneliness, and swept<br />
The desert of those ocean solitudes<br />
But vocal to the sea-bird&#8217;s harrowing shriek,<br />
The bellowing monster, and the rushing storm;<br />
Now to the sweet and many-mingling sounds<br />
Of kindliest human impulses respond. 100<br />
Those lonely realms bright garden-isles begem,<br />
With lightsome clouds and shining seas between,<br />
And fertile valleys, resonant with bliss,<br />
Whilst green woods overcanopy the wave,<br />
Which like a toil-worn laborer leaps to shore<br />
To meet the kisses of the flowrets there.</p>
<p>&#8216;All things are recreated, and the flame<br />
Of consentaneous love inspires all life.<br />
The fertile bosom of the earth gives suck<br />
To myriads, who still grow beneath her care, 110<br />
Rewarding her with their pure perfectness;<br />
The balmy breathings of the wind inhale<br />
Her virtues and diffuse them all abroad;<br />
Health floats amid the gentle atmosphere,<br />
Glows in the fruits and mantles on the stream;<br />
No storms deform the beaming brow of heaven,<br />
Nor scatter in the freshness of its pride<br />
The foliage of the ever-verdant trees;<br />
But fruits are ever ripe, flowers ever fair,<br />
And autumn proudly bears her matron grace, 120<br />
Kindling a flush on the fair cheek of spring,<br />
Whose virgin bloom beneath the ruddy fruit<br />
Reflects its tint and blushes into love.</p>
<p>&#8216;The lion now forgets to thirst for blood;<br />
There might you see him sporting in the sun<br />
Beside the dreadless kid; his claws are sheathed,<br />
His teeth are harmless, custom&#8217;s force has made<br />
His nature as the nature of a lamb.<br />
Like passion&#8217;s fruit, the nightshade&#8217;s tempting bane<br />
Poisons no more the pleasure it bestows; 130<br />
All bitterness is past; the cup of joy<br />
Unmingled mantles to the goblet&#8217;s brim<br />
And courts the thirsty lips it fled before.</p>
<p>But chief, ambiguous man, he that can know<br />
More misery, and dream more joy than all;<br />
Whose keen sensations thrill within his breast<br />
To mingle with a loftier instinct there,<br />
Lending their power to pleasure and to pain,<br />
Yet raising, sharpening, and refining each;<br />
Who stands amid the ever-varying world, 140<br />
The burden or the glory of the earth;<br />
He chief perceives the change; his being notes<br />
The gradual renovation and defines<br />
Each movement of its progress on his mind.</p>
<p>&#8216;Man, where the gloom of the long polar night<br />
Lowers o&#8217;er the snow-clad rocks and frozen soil,<br />
Where scarce the hardiest herb that braves the frost<br />
Basks in the moonlight&#8217;s ineffectual glow,<br />
Shrank with the plants, and darkened with the night;<br />
His chilled and narrow energies, his heart 150<br />
Insensible to courage, truth or love,<br />
His stunted stature and imbecile frame,<br />
Marked him for some abortion of the earth,<br />
Fit compeer of the bears that roamed around,<br />
Whose habits and enjoyments were his own;<br />
His life a feverish dream of stagnant woe,<br />
Whose meagre wants, but scantily fulfilled,<br />
Apprised him ever of the joyless length<br />
Which his short being&#8217;s wretchedness had reached;<br />
His death a pang which famine, cold and toil 160<br />
Long on the mind, whilst yet the vital spark<br />
Clung to the body stubbornly, had brought:<br />
All was inflicted here that earth&#8217;s revenge<br />
Could wreak on the infringers of her law;<br />
One curse alone was spared&#8211;the name of God.</p>
<p>&#8216;Nor, where the tropics bound the realms of day<br />
With a broad belt of mingling cloud and flame,<br />
Where blue mists through the unmoving atmosphere<br />
Scattered the seeds of pestilence and fed<br />
Unnatural vegetation, where the land 170<br />
Teemed with all earthquake, tempest and disease,<br />
Was man a nobler being; slavery<br />
Had crushed him to his country&#8217;s blood-stained dust;<br />
Or he was bartered for the fame of power,<br />
Which, all internal impulses destroying,<br />
Makes human will an article of trade;<br />
Or he was changed with Christians for their gold<br />
And dragged to distant isles, where to the sound<br />
Of the flesh-mangling scourge he does the work<br />
Of all-polluting luxury and wealth, 180<br />
Which doubly visits on the tyrants&#8217; heads<br />
The long-protracted fulness of their woe;<br />
Or he was led to legal butchery,<br />
To turn to worms beneath that burning sun<br />
Where kings first leagued against the rights of men<br />
And priests first traded with the name of God.</p>
<p>&#8216;Even where the milder zone afforded man<br />
A seeming shelter, yet contagion there,<br />
Blighting his being with unnumbered ills,<br />
Spread like a quenchless fire; nor truth till late 190<br />
Availed to arrest its progress or create<br />
That peace which first in bloodless victory waved<br />
Her snowy standard o&#8217;er this favored clime;<br />
There man was long the train-bearer of slaves,<br />
The mimic of surrounding misery,<br />
The jackal of ambition&#8217;s lion-rage,<br />
The bloodhound of religion&#8217;s hungry zeal.</p>
<p>&#8216;Here now the human being stands adorning<br />
This loveliest earth with taintless body and mind;<br />
Blest from his birth with all bland impulses, 200<br />
Which gently in his noble bosom wake<br />
All kindly passions and all pure desires.<br />
Him, still from hope to hope the bliss pursuing<br />
Which from the exhaustless store of human weal<br />
Draws on the virtuous mind, the thoughts that rise<br />
In time-destroying infiniteness gift<br />
With self-enshrined eternity, that mocks<br />
The unprevailing hoariness of age;<br />
And man, once fleeting o&#8217;er the transient scene<br />
Swift as an unremembered vision, stands 210<br />
Immortal upon earth; no longer now<br />
He slays the lamb that looks him in the face,<br />
And horribly devours his mangled flesh,<br />
Which, still avenging Nature&#8217;s broken law,<br />
Kindled all putrid humors in his frame,<br />
All evil passions and all vain belief,<br />
Hatred, despair and loathing in his mind,<br />
The germs of misery, death, disease and crime.<br />
No longer now the wing&egrave;d habitants,<br />
That in the woods their sweet lives sing away, 220<br />
Flee from the form of man; but gather round,<br />
And prune their sunny feathers on the hands<br />
Which little children stretch in friendly sport<br />
Towards these dreadless partners of their play.<br />
All things are void of terror; man has lost<br />
His terrible prerogative, and stands<br />
An equal amidst equals; happiness<br />
And science dawn, though late, upon the earth;<br />
Peace cheers the mind, health renovates the frame;<br />
Disease and pleasure cease to mingle here, 230<br />
Reason and passion cease to combat there;<br />
Whilst each unfettered o&#8217;er the earth extend<br />
Their all-subduing energies, and wield<br />
The sceptre of a vast dominion there;<br />
Whilst every shape and mode of matter lends<br />
Its force to the omnipotence of mind,<br />
Which from its dark mine drags the gem of truth<br />
To decorate its paradise of peace.&#8217;</p>
<p>IX<br />
&#8216;O happy Earth, reality of Heaven!<br />
To which those restless souls that ceaselessly<br />
Throng through the human universe, aspire!<br />
Thou consummation of all mortal hope!<br />
Thou glorious prize of blindly working will,<br />
Whose rays, diffused throughout all space and time,<br />
Verge to one point and blend forever there!<br />
Of purest spirits thou pure dwelling-place<br />
Where care and sorrow, impotence and crime,<br />
Languor, disease and ignorance dare not come! 10<br />
O happy Earth, reality of Heaven!</p>
<p>&#8216;Genius has seen thee in her passionate dreams;<br />
And dim forebodings of thy loveliness,<br />
Haunting the human heart, have there entwined<br />
Those rooted hopes of some sweet place of bliss,<br />
Where friends and lovers meet to part no more.<br />
Thou art the end of all desire and will,<br />
The product of all action; and the souls,<br />
That by the paths of an aspiring change<br />
Have reached thy haven of perpetual peace, 20<br />
There rest from the eternity of toil<br />
That framed the fabric of thy perfectness.</p>
<p>&#8216;Even Time, the conqueror, fled thee in his fear;<br />
That hoary giant, who in lonely pride<br />
So long had ruled the world that nations fell<br />
Beneath his silent footstep. Pyramids,<br />
That for millenniums had withstood the tide<br />
Of human things, his storm-breath drove in sand<br />
Across that desert where their stones survived<br />
The name of him whose pride had heaped them there. 30<br />
Yon monarch, in his solitary pomp,<br />
Was but the mushroom of a summer day,<br />
That his light-wing&egrave;d footstep pressed to dust;<br />
Time was the king of earth; all things gave way<br />
Before him but the fixed and virtuous will,<br />
The sacred sympathies of soul and sense,<br />
That mocked his fury and prepared his fall.</p>
<p>&#8216;Yet slow and gradual dawned the morn of love;<br />
Long lay the clouds of darkness o&#8217;er the scene,<br />
Till from its native heaven they rolled away: 40<br />
First, crime triumphant o&#8217;er all hope careered<br />
Unblushing, undisguising, bold and strong,<br />
Whilst falsehood, tricked in virtue&#8217;s attributes,<br />
Long sanctified all deeds of vice and woe,<br />
Till, done by her own venomous sting to death,<br />
She left the moral world without a law,<br />
No longer fettering passion&#8217;s fearless wing,<br />
Nor searing reason with the brand of God.<br />
Then steadily the happy ferment worked;<br />
Reason was free; and wild though passion went 50<br />
Through tangled glens and wood-embosomed meads,<br />
Gathering a garland of the strangest flowers,<br />
Yet, like the bee returning to her queen,<br />
She bound the sweetest on her sister&#8217;s brow,<br />
Who meek and sober kissed the sportive child,<br />
No longer trembling at the broken rod.</p>
<p>&#8216;Mild was the slow necessity of death.<br />
The tranquil spirit failed beneath its grasp,<br />
Without a groan, almost without a fear,<br />
Calm as a voyager to some distant land, 60<br />
And full of wonder, full of hope as he.<br />
The deadly germs of languor and disease<br />
Died in the human frame, and purity<br />
Blessed with all gifts her earthly worshippers.<br />
How vigorous then the athletic form of age!<br />
How clear its open and unwrinkled brow!<br />
Where neither avarice, cunning, pride or care<br />
Had stamped the seal of gray deformity<br />
On all the mingling lineaments of time.<br />
How lovely the intrepid front of youth, 70<br />
Which meek-eyed courage decked with freshest grace;<br />
Courage of soul, that dreaded not a name,<br />
And elevated will, that journeyed on<br />
Through life&#8217;s phantasmal scene in fearlessness,<br />
With virtue, love and pleasure, hand in hand!</p>
<p>&#8216;Then, that sweet bondage which is freedom&#8217;s self,<br />
And rivets with sensation&#8217;s softest tie<br />
The kindred sympathies of human souls,<br />
Needed no fetters of tyrannic law.<br />
Those delicate and timid impulses 80<br />
In Nature&#8217;s primal modesty arose,<br />
And with undoubting confidence disclosed<br />
The growing longings of its dawning love,<br />
Unchecked by dull and selfish chastity,<br />
That virtue of the cheaply virtuous,<br />
Who pride themselves in senselessness and frost.<br />
No longer prostitution&#8217;s venomed bane<br />
Poisoned the springs of happiness and life;<br />
Woman and man, in confidence and love,<br />
Equal and free and pure together trod 90<br />
The mountain-paths of virtue, which no more<br />
Were stained with blood from many a pilgrim&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>&#8216;Then, where, through distant ages, long in pride<br />
The palace of the monarch-slave had mocked<br />
Famine&#8217;s faint groan and penury&#8217;s silent tear,<br />
A heap of crumbling ruins stood, and threw<br />
Year after year their stones upon the field,<br />
Wakening a lonely echo; and the leaves<br />
Of the old thorn, that on the topmost tower<br />
Usurped the royal ensign&#8217;s grandeur, shook 100<br />
In the stern storm that swayed the topmost tower,<br />
And whispered strange tales in the whirlwind&#8217;s ear.</p>
<p>&#8216;Low through the lone cathedral&#8217;s roofless aisles<br />
The melancholy winds a death-dirge sung.<br />
It were a sight of awfulness to see<br />
The works of faith and slavery, so vast,<br />
So sumptuous, yet so perishing withal,<br />
Even as the corpse that rests beneath its wall!<br />
A thousand mourners deck the pomp of death<br />
To-day, the breathing marble glows above 110<br />
To decorate its memory, and tongues<br />
Are busy of its life; to-morrow, worms<br />
In silence and in darkness seize their prey.</p>
<p>&#8216;Within the massy prison&#8217;s mouldering courts,<br />
Fearless and free the ruddy children played,<br />
Weaving gay chaplets for their innocent brows<br />
With the green ivy and the red wall-flower<br />
That mock the dungeon&#8217;s unavailing gloom;<br />
The ponderous chains and gratings of strong iron<br />
There rusted amid heaps of broken stone 120<br />
That mingled slowly with their native earth;<br />
There the broad beam of day, which feebly once<br />
Lighted the cheek of lean captivity<br />
With a pale and sickly glare, then freely shone<br />
On the pure smiles of infant playfulness;<br />
No more the shuddering voice of hoarse despair<br />
Pealed through the echoing vaults, but soothing notes<br />
Of ivy-fingered winds and gladsome birds<br />
And merriment were resonant around.</p>
<p>&#8216;These ruins soon left not a wreck behind; 130<br />
Their elements, wide-scattered o&#8217;er the globe,<br />
To happier shapes were moulded, and became<br />
Ministrant to all blissful impulses;<br />
Thus human things were perfected, and earth,<br />
Even as a child beneath its mother&#8217;s love,<br />
Was strengthened in all excellence, and grew<br />
Fairer and nobler with each passing year.</p>
<p>&#8216;Now Time his dusky pennons o&#8217;er the scene<br />
Closes in steadfast darkness, and the past<br />
Fades from our charm&egrave;d sight. My task is done; 140<br />
Thy lore is learned. Earth&#8217;s wonders are thine own<br />
With all the fear and all the hope they bring.<br />
My spells are passed; the present now recurs.<br />
Ah me! a pathless wilderness remains<br />
Yet unsubdued by man&#8217;s reclaiming hand.</p>
<p>&#8216;Yet, human Spirit! bravely hold thy course;<br />
Let virtue teach thee firmly to pursue<br />
The gradual paths of an aspiring change;<br />
For birth and life and death, and that strange state<br />
Before the naked soul has found its home, 150<br />
All tend to perfect happiness, and urge<br />
The restless wheels of being on their way,<br />
Whose flashing spokes, instinct with infinite life,<br />
Bicker and burn to gain their destined goal;<br />
For birth but wakes the spirit to the sense<br />
Of outward shows, whose unexperienced shape<br />
New modes of passion to its frame may lend;<br />
Life is its state of action, and the store<br />
Of all events is aggregated there<br />
That variegate the eternal universe; 160<br />
Death is a gate of dreariness and gloom,<br />
That leads to azure isles and beaming skies<br />
And happy regions of eternal hope.<br />
Therefore, O Spirit! fearlessly bear on.<br />
Though storms may break the primrose on its stalk,<br />
Though frosts may blight the freshness of its bloom,<br />
Yet spring&#8217;s awakening breath will woo the earth<br />
To feed with kindliest dews its favorite flower,<br />
That blooms in mossy bank and darksome glens,<br />
Lighting the greenwood with its sunny smile. 170</p>
<p>&#8216;Fear not then, Spirit, death&#8217;s disrobing hand,<br />
So welcome when the tyrant is awake,<br />
So welcome when the bigot&#8217;s hell-torch burns;<br />
&#8216;T is but the voyage of a darksome hour,<br />
The transient gulf-dream of a startling sleep.<br />
Death is no foe to virtue; earth has seen<br />
Love&#8217;s brightest roses on the scaffold bloom,<br />
Mingling with freedom&#8217;s fadeless laurels there,<br />
And presaging the truth of visioned bliss.<br />
Are there not hopes within thee, which this scene 180<br />
Of linked and gradual being has confirmed?<br />
Whose stingings bade thy heart look further still,<br />
When, to the moonlight walk by Henry led,<br />
Sweetly and sadly thou didst talk of death?<br />
And wilt thou rudely tear them from thy breast,<br />
Listening supinely to a bigot&#8217;s creed,<br />
Or tamely crouching to the tyrant&#8217;s rod,<br />
Whose iron thongs are red with human gore?<br />
Never: but bravely bearing on, thy will<br />
Is destined an eternal war to wage 190<br />
With tyranny and falsehood, and uproot<br />
The germs of misery from the human heart.<br />
Thine is the hand whose piety would soothe<br />
The thorny pillow of unhappy crime,<br />
Whose impotence an easy pardon gains,<br />
Watching its wanderings as a friend&#8217;s disease;<br />
Thine is the brow whose mildness would defy<br />
Its fiercest rage, and brave its sternest will,<br />
When fenced by power and master of the world.<br />
Thou art sincere and good; of resolute mind, 200<br />
Free from heart-withering custom&#8217;s cold control,<br />
Of passion lofty, pure and unsubdued.<br />
Earth&#8217;s pride and meanness could not vanquish thee,<br />
And therefore art thou worthy of the boon<br />
Which thou hast now received; virtue shall keep<br />
Thy footsteps in the path that thou hast trod,<br />
And many days of beaming hope shall bless<br />
Thy spotless life of sweet and sacred love.<br />
Go, happy one, and give that bosom joy,<br />
Whose sleepless spirit waits to catch 210<br />
Light, life and rapture from thy smile!&#8217;</p>
<p>The Fairy waves her wand of charm.<br />
Speechless with bliss the Spirit mounts the car,<br />
That rolled beside the battlement,<br />
Bending her beamy eyes in thankfulness.<br />
Again the enchanted steeds were yoked;<br />
Again the burning wheels inflame<br />
The steep descent of heaven&#8217;s untrodden way.<br />
Fast and far the chariot flew;<br />
The vast and fiery globes that rolled 220<br />
Around the Fairy&#8217;s palace-gate<br />
Lessened by slow degrees, and soon appeared<br />
Such tiny twinklers as the planet orbs<br />
That there attendant on the solar power<br />
With borrowed light pursued their narrower way.</p>
<p>Earth floated then below;<br />
The chariot paused a moment there;<br />
The Spirit then descended;<br />
The restless coursers pawed the ungenial soil,<br />
Snuffed the gross air, and then, their errand done, 230<br />
Unfurled their pinions to the winds of heaven.</p>
<p>The Body and the Soul united then.<br />
A gentle start convulsed Ianthe&#8217;s frame;<br />
Her veiny eyelids quietly unclosed;<br />
Moveless awhile the dark blue orbs remained.<br />
She looked around in wonder, and beheld<br />
Henry, who kneeled in silence by her couch,<br />
Watching her sleep with looks of speechless love,<br />
And the bright beaming stars<br />
That through the casement shone.</p>
