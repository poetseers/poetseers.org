				<h4>Book 2 Leaves of Grass</h4>
<p>I<br />
Starting from fish-shape Paumanok where I was born,<br />
Well-begotten, and rais&#8217;d by a perfect mother,<br />
After roaming many lands, lover of populous pavements,<br />
Dweller in Mannahatta my city, or on southern savannas,<br />
Or a soldier camp&#8217;d or carrying my knapsack and gun, or a miner<br />
in California,<br />
Or rude in my home in Dakota&#8217;s woods, my diet meat, my drink<br />
from the spring,<br />
Or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess,<br />
Far from the clank of crowds intervals passing rapt and happy,</p>
<p>Aware of the fresh free giver the flowing Missouri, aware of mighty<br />
Niagara,<br />
Aware of the buffalo herds grazing the plains, the hirsute and<br />
strong-breasted bull,<br />
Of earth, rocks, Fifth-month flowers experienced, stars, rain, snow,<br />
my amaze,<br />
Having studied the mocking-bird&#8217;s tones and the flight of the<br />
mountain-hawk,<br />
And heard at dawn the unrivall&#8217;d one, the hermit thrush from the<br />
swamp-cedars,<br />
Solitary, singing in the West, I strike up for a New World.</p>
<p>2<br />
Victory, union, faith, identity, time,<br />
The indissoluble compacts, riches, mystery,<br />
Eternal progress, the kosmos, and the modern reports.<br />
This then is life,<br />
Here is what has come to the surface after so many throes and<br />
convulsions.</p>
<p>How curious! how real!<br />
Underfoot the divine soil, overhead the sun.</p>
<p>See revolving the globe,<br />
The ancestor-continents away group&#8217;d together,<br />
The present and future continents north and south, with the isthmus<br />
between.</p>
<p>See, vast trackless spaces,<br />
As in a dream they change, they swiftly fill,<br />
Countless masses debouch upon them,<br />
They are now cover&#8217;d with the foremost people, arts, institutions,<br />
known.</p>
<p>See, projected through time,<br />
For me an audience interminable.</p>
<p>With firm and regular step they wend, they never stop,<br />
Successions of men, Americanos, a hundred millions,<br />
One generation playing its part and passing on,<br />
Another generation playing its part and passing on in its turn,<br />
With faces turn&#8217;d sideways or backward towards me to listen,<br />
With eyes retrospective towards me.</p>
<p>3<br />
Americanos! conquerors! marches humanitarian!<br />
Foremost! century marches! Libertad! masses!<br />
For you a programme of chants.</p>
<p>Chants of the prairies,<br />
Chants of the long-running Mississippi, and down to the Mexican sea,<br />
Chants of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota,<br />
Chants going forth from the centre from Kansas, and thence<br />
equidistant,<br />
Shooting in pulses of fire ceaseless to vivify all.</p>
<p>4<br />
Take my leaves America, take them South and take them North,<br />
Make welcome for them everywhere, for they are your own off-spring,<br />
Surround them East and West, for they would surround you,<br />
And you precedents, connect lovingly with them, for they connect<br />
lovingly with you.</p>
<p>I conn&#8217;d old times,<br />
I sat studying at the feet of the great masters,<br />
Now if eligible O that the great masters might return and study me.</p>
<p>In the name of these States shall I scorn the antique?<br />
Why these are the children of the antique to justify it.</p>
<p>5<br />
Dead poets, philosophs, priests,<br />
Martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long since,<br />
Language-shapers on other shores,<br />
Nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or desolate,<br />
I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left<br />
waited hither,<br />
I have perused it, own it is admirable, (moving awhile among it,)<br />
Think nothing can ever be greater, nothing can ever deserve more<br />
than it deserves,<br />
Regarding it all intently a long while, then dismissing it,<br />
I stand in my place with my own day here.</p>
<p>Here lands female and male,<br />
Here the heir-ship and heiress-ship of the world, here the flame of<br />
materials,</p>
<p>Here spirituality the translatress, the openly-avow&#8217;d,<br />
The ever-tending, the finale of visible forms,<br />
The satisfier, after due long-waiting now advancing,<br />
Yes here comes my mistress the soul.</p>
<p>6<br />
The soul,<br />
Forever and forever- longer than soil is brown and solid- longer<br />
than water ebbs and flows.<br />
I will make the poems of materials, for I think they are to be the<br />
most spiritual poems,<br />
And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality,<br />
For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul and<br />
of immortality.</p>
<p>I will make a song for these States that no one State may under any<br />
circumstances be subjected to another State,<br />
And I will make a song that there shall be comity by day and by<br />
night between all the States, and between any two of them,<br />
And I will make a song for the ears of the President, full of<br />
weapons with menacing points,<br />
And behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces;<br />
And a song make I of the One form&#8217;d out of all,<br />
The fang&#8217;d and glittering One whose head is over all,<br />
Resolute warlike One including and over all,<br />
(However high the head of any else that head is over all.)</p>
<p>I will acknowledge contemporary lands,<br />
I will trail the whole geography of the globe and salute courteously<br />
every city large and small,<br />
And employments! I will put in my poems that with you is heroism<br />
upon land and sea,<br />
And I will report all heroism from an American point of view.</p>
<p>I will sing the song of companionship,<br />
I will show what alone must finally compact these,<br />
I believe these are to found their own ideal of manly love,<br />
indicating it in me,<br />
I will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were<br />
threatening to consume me,<br />
I will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering fires,<br />
I will give them complete abandonment,<br />
I will write the evangel-poem of comrades and of love,<br />
For who but I should understand love with all its sorrow and joy?<br />
And who but I should be the poet of comrades?</p>
<p>7<br />
I am the credulous man of qualities, ages, races,<br />
I advance from the people in their own spirit,<br />
Here is what sings unrestricted faith.</p>
<p>Omnes! omnes! let others ignore what they may,<br />
I make the poem of evil also, I commemorate that part also,<br />
I am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation is- and I say<br />
there is in fact no evil,<br />
(Or if there is I say it is just as important to you, to the land or<br />
to me, as any thing else.)</p>
<p>I too, following many and follow&#8217;d by many, inaugurate a religion, I<br />
descend into the arena,<br />
(It may be I am destin&#8217;d to utter the loudest cries there, the<br />
winner&#8217;s pealing shouts,<br />
Who knows? they may rise from me yet, and soar above every thing.)</p>
<p>Each is not for its own sake,<br />
I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are for<br />
religion&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough,<br />
None has ever yet adored or worship&#8217;d half enough,<br />
None has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how certain<br />
the future is.</p>
<p>I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States must be<br />
their religion,<br />
Otherwise there is just no real and permanent grandeur;<br />
(Nor character nor life worthy the name without religion,<br />
Nor land nor man or woman without religion.)</p>
<p>8<br />
What are you doing young man?<br />
Are you so earnest, so given up to literature, science, art, amours?<br />
These ostensible realities, politics, points?<br />
Your ambition or business whatever it may be?</p>
<p>It is well- against such I say not a word, I am their poet also,<br />
But behold! such swiftly subside, burnt up for religion&#8217;s sake,<br />
For not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the essential<br />
life of the earth,<br />
Any more than such are to religion.</p>
<p>9<br />
What do you seek so pensive and silent?<br />
What do you need camerado?<br />
Dear son do you think it is love?</p>
<p>Listen dear son- listen America, daughter or son,<br />
It is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excess, and yet it<br />
satisfies, it is great,<br />
But there is something else very great, it makes the whole coincide,<br />
It, magnificent, beyond materials, with continuous hands sweeps and<br />
provides for all.</p>
<p>10<br />
Know you, solely to drop in the earth the germs of a greater<br />
religion,<br />
The following chants each for its kind I sing.</p>
<p>My comrade!<br />
For you to share with me two greatnesses, and a third one rising<br />
inclusive and more resplendent,<br />
The greatness of Love and Democracy, and the greatness of Religion.</p>
<p>Melange mine own, the unseen and the seen,<br />
Mysterious ocean where the streams empty,<br />
Prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me,<br />
Living beings, identities now doubtless near us in the air that we<br />
know not of,<br />
Contact daily and hourly that will not release me,<br />
These selecting, these in hints demanded of me.</p>
<p>Not he with a daily kiss onward from childhood kissing me,<br />
Has winded and twisted around me that which holds me to him,<br />
Any more than I am held to the heavens and all the spiritual world,<br />
After what they have done to me, suggesting themes.</p>
<p>O such themes- equalities! O divine average!<br />
Warblings under the sun, usher&#8217;d as now, or at noon, or setting,<br />
Strains musical flowing through ages, now reaching hither,<br />
I take to your reckless and composite chords, add to them, and<br />
cheerfully pass them forward.</p>
<p>11<br />
As I have walk&#8217;d in Alabama my morning walk,<br />
I have seen where the she-bird the mocking-bird sat on her nest in<br />
the briers hatching her brood.</p>
<p>I have seen the he-bird also,<br />
I have paus&#8217;d to hear him near at hand inflating his throat and<br />
joyfully singing.</p>
<p>And while I paus&#8217;d it came to me that what he really sang for was<br />
not there only,<br />
Nor for his mate nor himself only, nor all sent back by the echoes,<br />
But subtle, clandestine, away beyond,<br />
A charge transmitted and gift occult for those being born.</p>
<p>12<br />
Democracy! near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and<br />
joyfully singing.</p>
<p>Ma femme! for the brood beyond us and of us,<br />
For those who belong here and those to come,<br />
I exultant to be ready for them will now shake out carols stronger<br />
and haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth.</p>
<p>I will make the songs of passion to give them their way,<br />
And your songs outlaw&#8217;d offenders, for I scan you with kindred eyes,<br />
and carry you with me the same as any.</p>
<p>I will make the true poem of riches,<br />
To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres and goes forward<br />
and is not dropt by death;<br />
I will effuse egotism and show it underlying all, and I will be the<br />
bard of personality,<br />
And I will show of male and female that either is but the equal of<br />
the other,<br />
And sexual organs and acts! do you concentrate in me, for I am<br />
determin&#8217;d to tell you with courageous clear voice to prove you<br />
illustrious,<br />
And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present, and<br />
can be none in the future,<br />
And I will show that whatever happens to anybody it may be turn&#8217;d to<br />
beautiful results,<br />
And I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death,</p>
<p>And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are<br />
compact,<br />
And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each<br />
as profound as any.</p>
<p>I will not make poems with reference to parts,<br />
But I will make poems, songs, thoughts, with reference to ensemble,<br />
And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference to<br />
all days,<br />
And I will not make a poem nor the least part of a poem but has<br />
reference to the soul,<br />
Because having look&#8217;d at the objects of the universe, I find there<br />
is no one nor any particle of one but has reference to the soul.</p>
<p>13<br />
Was somebody asking to see the soul?<br />
See, your own shape and countenance, persons, substances, beasts,<br />
the trees, the running rivers, the rocks and sands.</p>
<p>All hold spiritual joys and afterwards loosen them;<br />
How can the real body ever die and be buried?</p>
<p>Of your real body and any man&#8217;s or woman&#8217;s real body,<br />
Item for item it will elude the hands of the corpse-cleaners and<br />
pass to fitting spheres,<br />
Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the<br />
moment of death.</p>
<p>Not the types set up by the printer return their impression, the<br />
meaning, the main concern,<br />
Any more than a man&#8217;s substance and life or a woman&#8217;s substance and<br />
life return in the body and the soul,<br />
Indifferently before death and after death.</p>
<p>Behold, the body includes and is the meaning, the main concern and<br />
includes and is the soul;<br />
Whoever you are, how superb and how divine is your body, or any part<br />
of it!</p>
<p>14<br />
Whoever you are, to you endless announcements!</p>
<p>Daughter of the lands did you wait for your poet?<br />
Did you wait for one with a flowing mouth and indicative hand?</p>
<p>Toward the male of the States, and toward the female of the States,<br />
Exulting words, words to Democracy&#8217;s lands.</p>
<p>Interlink&#8217;d, food-yielding lands!<br />
Land of coal and iron! land of gold! land of cotton, sugar, rice!<br />
Land of wheat, beef, pork! land of wool and hemp! land of the apple<br />
and the grape!<br />
Land of the pastoral plains, the grass-fields of the world! land of<br />
those sweet-air&#8217;d interminable plateaus!<br />
Land of the herd, the garden, the healthy house of adobie!<br />
Lands where the north-west Columbia winds, and where the south-west<br />
Colorado winds!<br />
Land of the eastern Chesapeake! land of the Delaware!<br />
Land of Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan!<br />
Land of the Old Thirteen! Massachusetts land! land of Vermont and<br />
Connecticut!<br />
Land of the ocean shores! land of sierras and peaks!<br />
Land of boatmen and sailors! fishermen&#8217;s land!<br />
Inextricable lands! the clutch&#8217;d together! the passionate ones!<br />
The side by side! the elder and younger brothers! the bony-limb&#8217;d!<br />
The great women&#8217;s land! the feminine! the experienced sisters and<br />
the inexperienced sisters!<br />
Far breath&#8217;d land! Arctic braced! Mexican breez&#8217;d! the diverse! the<br />
compact!<br />
The Pennsylvanian! the Virginian! the double Carolinian!<br />
O all and each well-loved by me! my intrepid nations! O I at any<br />
rate include you all with perfect love!<br />
I cannot be discharged from you! not from one any sooner than<br />
another!<br />
O death! O for all that, I am yet of you unseen this hour with<br />
irrepressible love,<br />
Walking New England, a friend, a traveler,<br />
Splashing my bare feet in the edge of the summer ripples on<br />
Paumanok&#8217;s sands,<br />
Crossing the prairies, dwelling again in Chicago, dwelling in every<br />
town,<br />
Observing shows, births, improvements, structures, arts,<br />
Listening to orators and oratresses in public halls,<br />
Of and through the States as during life, each man and woman my<br />
neighbor,<br />
The Louisianian, the Georgian, as near to me, and I as near to him<br />
and her,<br />
The Mississippian and Arkansian yet with me, and I yet with any of<br />
them,</p>
<p>Yet upon the plains west of the spinal river, yet in my house of<br />
adobie,<br />
Yet returning eastward, yet in the Seaside State or in Maryland,<br />
Yet Kanadian cheerily braving the winter, the snow and ice welcome<br />
to me,<br />
Yet a true son either of Maine or of the Granite State, or the<br />
Narragansett Bay State, or the Empire State,<br />
Yet sailing to other shores to annex the same, yet welcoming every<br />
new brother,<br />
Hereby applying these leaves to the new ones from the hour they<br />
unite with the old ones,<br />
Coming among the new ones myself to be their companion and equal,<br />
coming personally to you now,<br />
Enjoining you to acts, characters, spectacles, with me.</p>
<p>15<br />
With me with firm holding, yet haste, haste on.<br />
For your life adhere to me,<br />
(I may have to be persuaded many times before I consent to give<br />
myself really to you, but what of that?<br />
Must not Nature be persuaded many times?)</p>
<p>No dainty dolce affettuoso I,<br />
Bearded, sun-burnt, gray-neck&#8217;d, forbidding, I have arrived,<br />
To be wrestled with as I pass for the solid prizes of the universe,<br />
For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them.</p>
<p>16<br />
On my way a moment I pause,<br />
Here for you! and here for America!<br />
Still the present I raise aloft, still the future of the States I<br />
harbinge glad and sublime,<br />
And for the past I pronounce what the air holds of the red<br />
aborigines.</p>
<p>The red aborigines,<br />
Leaving natural breaths, sounds of rain and winds, calls as of birds<br />
and animals in the woods, syllabled to us for names,<br />
Okonee, Koosa, Ottawa, Monongahela, Sauk, Natchez, Chattahoochee,<br />
Kaqueta, Oronoco,<br />
Wabash, Miami, Saginaw, Chippewa, Oshkosh, Walla-Walla,<br />
Leaving such to the States they melt, they depart, charging the<br />
water and the land with names.</p>
<p>17<br />
Expanding and swift, henceforth,<br />
Elements, breeds, adjustments, turbulent, quick and audacious,<br />
A world primal again, vistas of glory incessant and branching,<br />
A new race dominating previous ones and grander far, with new<br />
contests,<br />
New politics, new literatures and religions, new inventions and<br />
arts.</p>
<p>These, my voice announcing- I will sleep no more but arise,<br />
You oceans that have been calm within me! how I feel you,<br />
fathomless, stirring, preparing unprecedented waves and storms.</p>
<p>18<br />
See, steamers steaming through my poems,<br />
See, in my poems immigrants continually coming and landing,<br />
See, in arriere, the wigwam, the trail, the hunter&#8217;s hut, the<br />
flat-boat, the maize-leaf, the claim, the rude fence, and the<br />
backwoods village,<br />
See, on the one side the Western Sea and on the other the Eastern<br />
Sea, how they advance and retreat upon my poems as upon their<br />
own shores,<br />
See, pastures and forests in my poems -see, animals wild and tame-<br />
see, beyond the Kaw, countless herds of buffalo feeding on<br />
short curly grass,<br />
See, in my poems, cities, solid, vast, inland, with paved streets,<br />
with iron and stone edifices, ceaseless vehicles, and commerce,<br />
See, the many-cylinder&#8217;d steam printing-press- see, the electric<br />
telegraph stretching across the continent,<br />
See, through Atlantica&#8217;s depths pulses American Europe reaching,<br />
pulses of Europe duly return&#8217;d,<br />
See, the strong and quick locomotive as it departs, panting, blowing<br />
the steam-whistle,<br />
See, ploughmen ploughing farms- see, miners digging mines- see,<br />
the numberless factories,<br />
See, mechanics busy at their benches with tools- see from among<br />
them superior judges, philosophs, Presidents, emerge, drest<br />
in working dresses,<br />
See, lounging through the shops and fields of the States, me<br />
well-belov&#8217;d, close-held by day and night,<br />
Hear the loud echoes of my songs there- read the hints come at last.</p>
<p>19<br />
O camerado close! O you and me at last, and us two only.<br />
O a word to clear one&#8217;s path ahead endlessly!<br />
O something ecstatic and undemonstrable! O music wild!<br />
O now I triumph- and you shall also;<br />
O hand in hand- O wholesome pleasure- O one more desirer and lover!<br />
O to haste firm holding- to haste, haste on with me.</p>
