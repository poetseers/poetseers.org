				<p>I<br />
I sing the body electric,<br />
The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them,<br />
They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,<br />
And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul.</p>
<p>Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal<br />
themselves?<br />
And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead?<br />
And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul?<br />
And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?</p>
<p>2<br />
The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself<br />
balks account,<br />
That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.</p>
<p>The expression of the face<br />
balks account,<br />
But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his <br />
face,It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of<br />
his hips and wrists,<br />
It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist<br />
and knees, dress does not hide him,<br />
The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and<br />
broadcloth,<br />
To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more,<br />
You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and<br />
shoulder-side.</p>
<p>The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the<br />
folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the<br />
contour of their shape downwards,<br />
The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through<br />
the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls<br />
silently to and from the heave of the water,<br />
The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the<br />
horse-man in his saddle,<br />
Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,<br />
The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open<br />
dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting,<br />
The female soothing a child, the farmer&#8217;s daughter in the garden or<br />
cow-yard,<br />
The young fellow hosing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six<br />
horses through the crowd,<br />
The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty,<br />
good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sundown<br />
after work,<br />
The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,<br />
The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding<br />
the eyes;<br />
The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine<br />
muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps,<br />
The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes<br />
suddenly again, and the listening on the alert,<br />
The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv&#8217;d<br />
neck and the counting;<br />
Such-like I love- I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother&#8217;s<br />
breast with the little child,<br />
Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with<br />
the firemen, and pause, listen, count.</p>
<p>3<br />
I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons,<br />
And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons.This man was a wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person,<br />
The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and<br />
beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness<br />
and breadth of his manners,<br />
These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also,<br />
He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were<br />
massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome,<br />
They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him,<br />
They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal<br />
love,<br />
He drank water only, the blood show&#8217;d like scarlet through the<br />
clear-brown skin of his face,<br />
He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail&#8217;d his boat himself, he<br />
had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had<br />
fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him,<br />
When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish,<br />
you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of<br />
the gang,<br />
You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit<br />
by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other.</p>
<p>4<br />
I have perceiv&#8217;d that to be with those I like is enough,<br />
To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,<br />
To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is<br />
enough,<br />
To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly<br />
round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then?<br />
I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea.</p>
<p>There is something in staying close to men and women and looking<br />
on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases<br />
the soul well,<br />
All things please the soul, but these please the soul well.</p>
<p>5<br />
This is the female form,<br />
A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot,<br />
It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction,<br />
I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor,<br />
all falls aside but myself and it,<br />
Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what<br />
was expected of heaven or fear&#8217;d of hell, are now consumed,</p>
<p>Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response<br />
likewise ungovernable,<br />
Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all<br />
diffused, mine too diffused,<br />
Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling<br />
and deliciously aching,<br />
Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of<br />
love, white-blow and delirious nice,<br />
Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the<br />
prostrate dawn,<br />
Undulating into the willing and yielding day,<br />
Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh&#8217;d day.</p>
<p>This the nucleus- after the child is born of woman, man is born of<br />
woman,<br />
This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the<br />
outlet again.</p>
<p>Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the<br />
exit of the rest,<br />
You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.</p>
<p>The female contains all qualities and tempers them,<br />
She is in her place and moves with perfect balance,<br />
She is all things duly veil&#8217;d, she is both passive and active,<br />
She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as<br />
daughters.</p>
<p>As I see my soul reflected in Nature,<br />
As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness,<br />
sanity, beauty,<br />
See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see.</p>
<p>6<br />
The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place,<br />
He too is all qualities, he is action and power,<br />
The flush of the known universe is in him,<br />
Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well,<br />
The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is<br />
utmost become him well, pride is for him,<br />
The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul,<br />
Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to<br />
the test of himself,</p>
<p>Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes<br />
soundings at last only here,<br />
(Where else does he strike soundings except here?)</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s body is sacred and the woman&#8217;s body is sacred,<br />
No matter who it is, it is sacred- is it the meanest one in the<br />
laborers&#8217; gang?<br />
Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf?<br />
Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as<br />
much as you,<br />
Each has his or her place in the procession.</p>
<p>(All is a procession,<br />
The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.)</p>
<p>Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant?<br />
Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has<br />
no right to a sight?<br />
Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and<br />
the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation<br />
sprouts,<br />
For you only, and not for him and her?</p>
<p>7<br />
A man&#8217;s body at auction,<br />
(For before the war I often go to the slave-mart and watch the<br />
sale,)<br />
I help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business.</p>
<p>Gentlemen look on this wonder,<br />
Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it,<br />
For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one<br />
animal or plant,<br />
For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll&#8217;d.</p>
<p>In this head the all-baffling brain,<br />
In it and below it the makings of heroes.</p>
<p>Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in<br />
tendon and nerve,<br />
They shall be stript that you may see them.</p>
<p>Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition,<br />
Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby,<br />
good-sized arms and legs,<br />
And wonders within there yet.</p>
<p>Within there runs blood,<br />
The same old blood! the same red-running blood!<br />
There swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires,<br />
reachings, aspirations,<br />
(Do you think they are not there because they are not express&#8217;d in<br />
parlors and lecture-rooms?)</p>
<p>This is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be<br />
fathers in their turns,<br />
In him the start of populous states and rich republics,<br />
Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and<br />
enjoyments.</p>
<p>How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring<br />
through the centuries?<br />
(Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace<br />
back through the centuries?)</p>
<p>8<br />
A woman&#8217;s body at auction,<br />
She too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of mothers,<br />
She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the<br />
mothers.</p>
<p>Have you ever loved the body of a woman?<br />
Have you ever loved the body of a man?<br />
Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations<br />
and times all over the earth?</p>
<p>If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred,<br />
And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted,<br />
And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is more<br />
beautiful than the most beautiful face.</p>
<p>Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool<br />
that corrupted her own live body?<br />
For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves.</p>
<p>9<br />
O my body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and<br />
women, nor the likes of the parts of you,<br />
I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of<br />
the soul, (and that they are the soul,)</p>
<p>I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems, and<br />
that they are my poems,<br />
Man&#8217;s, woman&#8217;s, child, youth&#8217;s, wife&#8217;s, husband&#8217;s, mother&#8217;s,<br />
father&#8217;s, young man&#8217;s, young woman&#8217;s poems,<br />
Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears,<br />
Eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eyebrows, and the waking or<br />
sleeping of the lids,<br />
Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the<br />
jaw-hinges,<br />
Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition,<br />
Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck,<br />
neck-slue,<br />
Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders, and the<br />
ample side-round of the chest,<br />
Upper-arm, armpit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews, arm-bones,<br />
Wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, forefinger,<br />
finger-joints, finger-nails,<br />
Broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-bone,<br />
breast-side,<br />
Ribs, belly, backbone, joints of the backbone,<br />
Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward round,<br />
man-balls, man-root,<br />
Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above,<br />
Leg-fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under-leg,<br />
Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel;<br />
All attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your<br />
body or of any one&#8217;s body, male or female,<br />
The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and clean,<br />
The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame,<br />
Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, maternity,<br />
Womanhood, and all that is a woman, and the man that comes from<br />
woman,<br />
The womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping,<br />
love-looks, love-perturbations and risings,<br />
The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud,<br />
Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming,<br />
Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and<br />
tightening,<br />
The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes,<br />
The skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, hair,<br />
The curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked<br />
meat of the body,<br />
The circling rivers the breath, and breathing it in and out,</p>
<p>The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward<br />
toward the knees,<br />
The thin red jellies within you or within me, the bones and the<br />
marrow in the bones,<br />
The exquisite realization of health;<br />
O I say these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but of<br />
the soul,<br />
O I say now these are the soul!</p>
