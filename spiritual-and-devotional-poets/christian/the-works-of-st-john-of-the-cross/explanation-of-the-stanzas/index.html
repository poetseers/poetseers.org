				<p>ARGUMENT</p>
<p>These stanzas describe the career of a soul from its first<br />
entrance on the service of God till it comes to the final state of<br />
perfection&#8211;the spiritual marriage. They refer accordingly to the<br />
three states or ways of the spiritual training&#8211;the purgative,<br />
illuminative, and unitive ways, some properties and effects of<br />
which they explain.</p>
<p>The first stanzas relate to beginners&#8211;to the purgative way. The<br />
second to the advanced&#8211;to the state of spiritual betrothal; that<br />
is, the illuminative way. The next to the unitive way&#8211;that of the<br />
perfect, the spiritual Marriage. The unitive way, that of the<br />
perfect, follows the illuminative, which is that of the advanced.</p>
<p>The last stanzas treat of the beatific state, which only the<br />
already perfect soul aims at.</p>
<p>EXPLANATION OF THE STANZAS</p>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>THE soul, considering the obligations of its state, seeing that<br />
&#8216;the days of man are short;&#8217; [11] that the way of eternal life is<br />
strait; [12] that &#8216;the just man shall scarcely be saved;&#8217; [13]<br />
that the things of this world are empty and deceitful; that all<br />
die and perish like water poured on the ground; [14] that time is<br />
uncertain, the last account strict, perdition most easy, and<br />
salvation most difficult; and recognising also, on the other<br />
hand, the great debt that is owing to God, Who has created it<br />
solely for Himself, for which the service of its whole life is<br />
due, Who has redeemed it for Himself alone, for which it owes Him<br />
all else, and the correspondence of its will to His love; and<br />
remembering other innumerable blessings for which it acknowledges<br />
itself indebted to God even before it was born: and also that a<br />
great part of its life has been wasted, and that it will have to<br />
render an account of it all from beginning unto the end, to the<br />
payment of &#8216;the last farthing,&#8217; [15] when God shall &#8216;search<br />
Jerusalem with lamps;&#8217; [16] that it is already late, and perhaps<br />
the end of the day: [17] in order to remedy so great an evil,<br />
especially when it is conscious that God is grievously offended,<br />
and that He has hidden His face from it, because it would forget<br />
Him for the creature,&ETH;the soul, now touched with sorrow and<br />
inward sinking of the heart at the sight of its imminent risks<br />
and ruin, renouncing everything and casting them aside without<br />
delaying for a day, or even an hour, with fear and groanings<br />
uttered from the heart, and wounded with the love of God, begins<br />
to invoke the Beloved and says:</p>
<p>STANZA I</p>
<p>THE BRIDE</p>
<p>Where hast Thou hidden Thyself,<br />
And abandoned me to my sorrow, O my Beloved!<br />
Thou hast fled like the hart,<br />
Having wounded me.<br />
I ran after Thee, crying; but Thou wert gone.</p>
<p>IN this first stanza the soul, enamoured of the Word, the Son of<br />
God, the Bridegroom, desiring to be united to Him in the clear and<br />
substantial vision, sets before Him the anxieties of its love,<br />
complaining of His absence. And this the more so because, now<br />
pierced and wounded with love, for which it had abandoned all<br />
things, even itself, it has still to endure the absence of the<br />
Beloved, Who has not released it from its mortal flesh, that it<br />
might have the fruition of Him in the glory of eternity. Hence it<br />
cries out,</p>
<p>&#8216;Where hast Thou hidden Thyself?&#8217;</p>
<p>2. It is as if the soul said, &#8216;Show me, O Thou the Word, my<br />
Bridegroom, the place where Thou art hidden.&#8217; It asks for the<br />
revelation of the divine Essence; for the place where the Son of<br />
God is hidden is, according to St. John, &#8216;the bosom of the<br />
Father,&#8217; [18] which is the divine Essence, transcending all mortal<br />
vision, and hidden from all human understanding, as Isaias saith,<br />
speaking to God, &#8216;Verily Thou art a hidden God.&#8217; [19] From this we<br />
learn that the communication and sense of His presence, however<br />
great they may be, and the most sublime and profound knowledge of<br />
God which the soul may have in this life, are not God essentially,<br />
neither have they any affinity with Him, for in very truth He is<br />
still hidden from the soul; and it is therefore expedient for it,<br />
amid all these grandeurs, always to consider Him as hidden, and to<br />
seek Him in His hiding-place, saying,</p>
<p>&#8216;Where hast Thou hidden Thyself?&#8217;</p>
<p>3. Neither sublime communications nor sensible presence furnish<br />
any certain proof of His gracious presence; nor is the absence<br />
thereof, and aridity, any proof of His absence from the soul. &#8216;If<br />
He come to me, I shall not see Him; if He depart, I shall not<br />
understand.&#8217; [20] That is, if the soul have any great<br />
communication, or impression, or spiritual knowledge, it must not<br />
on that account persuade itself that what it then feels is to<br />
enjoy or see God clearly and in His Essence, or that it brings it<br />
nearer to Him, or Him to it, however deep such feelings may be.<br />
On the other hand, when all these sensible and spiritual<br />
communications fail it, and it is itself in dryness, darkness,<br />
and desolation, it must not on that account suppose that God is<br />
far from it; for in truth the former state is no sign of its<br />
being in a state of grace, nor is the latter a sign that it is<br />
not; for &#8216;man knoweth not whether he be worthy of love or hatred&#8217;<br />
[21] in the sight of God.</p>
<p>4. The chief object of the soul in these words is not to ask only<br />
for that affective and sensible devotion, wherein there is no<br />
certainty or evidence of the possession of the Bridegroom in this<br />
life; but principally for that clear presence and vision of His<br />
Essence, of which it longs to be assured and satisfied in the<br />
next. This, too, was the object of the bride who, in the divine<br />
song desiring to be united to the Divinity of the Bridegroom Word,<br />
prayed to the Father, saying, &#8216;Show me where Thou feedest, where<br />
Thou liest in the midday.&#8217; [22] For to ask to be shown the place<br />
where He fed was to ask to be shown the Essence of the Divine<br />
Word, the Son; because the Father feedeth nowhere else but in His<br />
only begotten Son, Who is the glory of the Father. In asking to be<br />
shown the place where He lieth in the midday, was to ask for the<br />
same thing, because the Son is the sole delight of the Father, Who<br />
lieth in no other place, and is comprehended by no other thing,<br />
but in and by His beloved Son, in Whom He reposeth wholly,<br />
communicating to Him His whole Essence, in the &#8216;midday,&#8217; which is<br />
eternity, where the Father is ever begetting and the Son ever<br />
begotten.</p>
<p>5. This pasture, then, is the Bridegroom Word, where the Father<br />
feedeth in infinite glory. He is also the bed of flowers whereupon<br />
He reposes with infinite delight of love, profoundly hidden from<br />
all mortal vision and every created thing. This is the meaning of<br />
the bride-soul when she says,</p>
<p>&#8216;Where hast Thou hidden Thyself?&#8217;</p>
<p>6. That the thirsty soul may find the Bridegroom, and be one with<br />
Him in the union of love in this life&#8211;so far as that is possible&#8211;<br />
and quench its thirst with that drink which it is possible to<br />
drink of at His hands in this life, it will be as well&#8211;since that<br />
is what the Soul asks of Him&#8211;that We should answer for Him, and<br />
point out the special spot where He is hidden, that He may be<br />
found there in that perfection and sweetness of which this life is<br />
capable, and that the soul may not begin to loiter uselessly in<br />
the footsteps of its companions.</p>
<p>7. We must remember that the Word, the Son of God, together with<br />
the Father and the Holy Ghost, is hidden in essence and in<br />
presence, in the inmost being of the soul. That soul, therefore,<br />
that will find Him, must go out from all things in will and<br />
affection, and enter into the profoundest self-recollection, and<br />
all things must be to it as if they existed not. Hence, St.<br />
Augustine saith: &#8216;I found Thee not without, O Lord; I sought Thee<br />
without in vain, for Thou art within,&#8217; [23] God is therefore<br />
hidden within the soul, and the true contemplative will seek Him<br />
there in love, saying,</p>
<p>&#8216;Where hast Thou hidden Thyself?&#8217;</p>
<p>8. O thou soul, then, most beautiful of creatures, who so longest<br />
to know the place where thy Beloved is, that thou mayest seek Him,<br />
and be united to Him, thou knowest now that thou art thyself that<br />
very tabernacle where He dwells, the secret chamber of His retreat<br />
where He is hidden. Rejoice, therefore, and exult, because all thy<br />
good and all thy hope is so near thee as to be within thee; or, to<br />
speak more accurately, that thou canst not be without it, &#8216;for lo,<br />
the kingdom of God is within you.&#8217; [24] So saith the Bridegroom<br />
Himself, and His servant, St. Paul, adds: &#8216;You are the temple of<br />
the living God.&#8217; [25] What joy for the soul to learn that God<br />
never abandons it, even in mortal sin; how much less in a state<br />
of grace! [26]</p>
<p>9. What more canst thou desire, what more canst thou seek without,<br />
seeing that within thou hast thy riches, thy delight, thy<br />
satisfaction, thy fulness and thy kingdom; that is, thy Beloved,<br />
Whom thou desirest and seekest? Rejoice, then, and be glad in Him<br />
with interior recollection, seeing that thou hast Him so near.<br />
Then love Him, then desire Him, then adore Him, and go not to seek<br />
Him out of thyself, for that will be but distraction and<br />
weariness, and thou shalt not find Him; because there is no<br />
fruition of Him more certain, more ready, or more intimate than<br />
that which is within.</p>
<p>10. One difficulty alone remains: though He is within, yet He is<br />
hidden. But it is a great matter to know the place of His secret<br />
rest, that He may be sought there with certainty. The knowledge of<br />
this is that which thou askest for here, O soul, when with loving<br />
affection thou criest,</p>
<p>&#8216;Where hast Thou hidden Thyself?&#8217;</p>
<p>11. You will still urge and say, How comes it, then, that I find<br />
Him not, nor feel Him, if He is within my soul? It is because He<br />
is hidden, and because thou hidest not thyself also that thou<br />
mayest find Him and feel Him; for he that will seek that which is<br />
hidden must enter secretly into the secret place where it is<br />
hidden, and when he finds it, he is himself hidden like the object<br />
of his search. Seeing, then, that the Bridegroom whom thou lovest<br />
is &#8216;the treasure hidden in the field&#8217; [27] of thy soul, for which<br />
the wise merchant gave all that he had, so thou, if thou wilt<br />
find Him, must forget all that is thine, withdraw from all<br />
created things, and hide thyself in the secret retreat of the<br />
spirit, shutting the door upon thyself&#8211;that is, denying thy will<br />
in all things&#8211;and praying to thy Father in secret. [28] Then<br />
thou, being hidden with Him, wilt be conscious of His presence in<br />
secret, and wilt love Him, possess Him in secret, and delight in<br />
Him in secret, in a way that no tongue or language can express.</p>
<p>12. Courage, then, O soul most beautiful, thou knowest now that<br />
thy Beloved, Whom thou desirest, dwelleth hidden within thy<br />
breast; strive, therefore, to be truly hidden with Him, and then<br />
thou shalt embrace Him, and be conscious of His presence with<br />
loving affection. Consider also that He bids thee, by the mouth of<br />
Isaias, to come to His secret hiding-place, saying, Go, . . . enter<br />
into thy chambers, shut thy doors upon thee&#8217;; that is, all thy<br />
faculties, so that no created thing shall enter: &#8216;be hid a little<br />
for a moment,&#8217; [29] that is, for the moment of this mortal life;<br />
for<br />
if now during this life which is short, thou wilt &#8216;with all<br />
watchfulness keep thy heart,&#8217; [30] as the wise man saith, God will<br />
most assuredly give thee, as He hath promised by the prophet<br />
Isaias, &#8216;hidden treasures and mysteries of secrets.&#8217; [31] The<br />
substance of these secrets is God Himself, for He is the substance<br />
of the faith, and the object of it, and the faith is the secret<br />
and the mystery. And when that which the faith conceals shall be<br />
revealed and made manifest, that is the perfection of God, as St.<br />
Paul saith, &#8216;When that which is perfect is come,&#8217; [32] then shall<br />
be revealed to the soul the substance and mysteries of these<br />
secrets.</p>
<p>13. Though in this mortal life the soul will never reach to the<br />
interior secrets as it will in the next, however much it may hide<br />
itself, still, if it will hide itself with Moses, &#8216;in the hole of<br />
the rock&#8217;&#8211;which is a real imitation of the perfect life of the<br />
Bridegroom, the Son of God&#8211;protected by the right hand of God, it<br />
will merit the vision of the &#8216;back parts&#8217;; [33] that is, it will<br />
reach to such perfection here, as to be united, and transformed by<br />
love, in the Son of God, its Bridegroom. So effectually will this<br />
be wrought that the soul will feel itself so united to Him, so<br />
learned and so instructed in His secrets, that, so far as the<br />
knowledge of Him in this life is concerned, it will be no longer<br />
necessary for it to say: &#8216;Where hast Thou hidden Thyself?&#8217;</p>
<p>14. Thou knowest then, O soul, how thou art to demean thyself if<br />
thou wilt find the Bridegroom in His secret place. But if thou<br />
wilt hear it again, hear this one word full of substance and<br />
unapproachable truth: Seek Him in faith and love, without seeking<br />
to satisfy thyself in aught, or to understand more than is<br />
expedient for thee to know; for faith and love are the two guides<br />
of the blind; they will lead thee, by a way thou knowest not, to<br />
the secret chamber of God. Faith, the secret of which I am<br />
speaking, is the foot that journeys onwards to God, and love is<br />
the guide that directs its steps. And while the soul meditates on<br />
the mysterious secrets of the faith, it will merit the revelation,<br />
on the part of love, of that which the faith involves, namely, the<br />
Bridegroom Whom it longs for, in this life by spiritual grace, and<br />
the divine union, as we said before, [34] and in the next in<br />
essential glory, face to face, hidden now.</p>
<p>15. But meanwhile, though the soul attains to union, the highest<br />
state possible in this life, yet inasmuch as He is still hidden<br />
from it in the bosom of the Father, as I have said, the soul<br />
longing for the fruition of Him in the life to come, ever cries,<br />
&#8216;Where hast Thou hidden Thyself?&#8217;</p>
<p>16. Thou doest well, then, O soul, in seeking Him always in His<br />
secret place; for thou greatly magnifiest God, and drawest near<br />
unto Him, esteeming Him as far beyond and above all thou canst<br />
reach. Rest, therefore, neither wholly nor in part, on what thy<br />
faculties can embrace; never seek to satisfy thyself with what<br />
thou comprehendest of God, but rather with what thou comprehendest<br />
not; and never rest on the love of, and delight in, that which<br />
thou canst understand and feel, but rather on that which is beyond<br />
thy understanding and feeling: this is, as I have said, to seek<br />
Him by faith.</p>
<p>17. God is, as I said before, [35] inaccessible and hidden, and<br />
though it may seem that thou hast found Him, felt Him, and<br />
comprehended Him, yet thou must ever regard Him as hidden, serve<br />
Him as hidden, in secret. Be not thou like many unwise, who, with<br />
low views of God, think that when they cannot comprehend Him, or<br />
be conscious of His presence, that He is then farther away and<br />
more hidden, when the contrary is true, namely, that He is nearer<br />
to them when they are least aware of it; as the prophet David<br />
saith, &#8216;He put darkness His covert,&#8217; [36] Thus, when thou art near<br />
unto Him, the very infirmity of thy vision makes the darkness<br />
palpable; thou doest well, therefore, at all times, in prosperity<br />
as well as in adversity, spiritual or temporal, to look upon God<br />
as hidden, and to say unto Him, &#8216;Where hast Thou hidden Thyself?</p>
<p>&#8216;And left me to my sorrow, O my Beloved?&#8217;</p>
<p>18. The soul calls Him &#8216;my Beloved,&#8217; the more to move Him to<br />
listen to its cry, for God, when loved, most readily listens to<br />
the prayer of him who loves Him. Thus He speaks Himself: &#8216;If you<br />
abide in Me . . . you shall ask what thing soever you will, and it<br />
shall be done to you.&#8217; [37] The soul may then with truth call Him<br />
Beloved, when it is wholly His, when the heart has no attachments<br />
but Him, and when all the thoughts are continually directed to<br />
Him. It was the absence of this that made Delila say to Samson,<br />
&#8216;How dost thou say thou lovest me when thy mind is not with me?&#8217;<br />
[38] The mind comprises the thoughts and the feelings. Some there<br />
are who call the Bridegroom their Beloved, but He is not really<br />
beloved, because their heart is not wholly with Him. Their prayers<br />
are, therefore, not so effectual before God, and they shall not<br />
obtain their petitions until, persevering in prayer, they fix<br />
their minds more constantly upon God and their hearts more wholly<br />
in loving affection upon Him, for nothing can be obtained from God<br />
but by love.</p>
<p>19. The words, &#8216;And left me to my sorrow,&#8217; tell us that the<br />
absence of the Beloved is the cause of continual sadness in him<br />
who loves; for as such an one loves none else, so, in the absence<br />
of the object beloved, nothing can console or relieve him. This<br />
is, therefore, a test to discern the true lover of God. Is he<br />
satisfied with anything less than God? Do I say satisfied? Yea, if<br />
a man possess all things, he cannot be satisfied; the greater his<br />
possessions the less will be his satisfaction, for the<br />
satisfaction of the heart is not found in possessions, but in<br />
detachment from all things and in poverty of spirit. This being<br />
so, the perfection of love in which we possess God, by a grace<br />
most intimate and special, lives in the soul in this life when it<br />
has reached it, with a certain satisfaction, which however is not<br />
full, for David, notwithstanding all his perfection, hoped for<br />
that in heaven saying, &#8216;I shall be satisfied when Thy glory shall<br />
appear.&#8217; [39]</p>
<p>20. Thus, then, the peace and tranquillity and satisfaction of<br />
heart to which the soul may attain in this life are not sufficient<br />
to relieve it from its groaning, peaceful and painless though it<br />
be, while it hopes for that which is still wanting. Groaning<br />
belongs to hope, as the Apostle says of himself and others, though<br />
perfect, &#8216;Ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit,<br />
even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption<br />
of the sons of God.&#8217; [40] The soul groans when the heart is<br />
enamoured, for where love wounds there is heard the groaning of<br />
the wounded one, complaining feelingly of the absence of the<br />
Beloved, especially when, after tasting of the sweet converse of<br />
the Bridegroom, it finds itself suddenly alone, and in aridity,<br />
because He has gone away. That is why it cries,</p>
<p>&#8216;Thou hast fled like the hart.&#8217;</p>
<p>21. Here it is to be observed that in the Canticle of Canticles<br />
the bride compares the Bridegroom to the roe and the hart on the<br />
mountains&#8211;&#8217;My Beloved is like unto a roe and to a fawn of<br />
harts&#8217; [41]&#8211;not only because He is shy, solitary, and avoids<br />
companions as the hart, but also for his sudden appearance and<br />
disappearance. That is His way in His visits to devout souls in<br />
order to comfort and encourage them, and in the withdrawing and<br />
absence which He makes them feel after those visits in order to<br />
try, humble, and teach them. For that purpose He makes them feel<br />
the pain of His absence most keenly, as the following words show:</p>
<p>&#8216;Having wounded me.&#8217;</p>
<p>22. It is as if it had said, &#8216;It was not enough that I should feel<br />
the pain and grief which Thy absence causes, and from which I am<br />
continually suffering, but Thou must, after wounding me with the<br />
arrow of Thy love, and increasing my longing and desire to see<br />
Thee, run away from me with the swiftness of the hart, and not<br />
permit me to lay hold of Thee, even for a moment.&#8217;</p>
<p>23. For the clearer understanding of this we are to keep in mind<br />
that, beside the many kinds of God&#8217;s visits to the soul, in which<br />
He wounds it with love, there are commonly certain secret touches<br />
of love, which, like a fiery arrow, pierce and penetrate the soul,<br />
and burn it with the fire of love. These are properly called the<br />
wounds of love, and it is of these the soul is here speaking.<br />
These wounds so inflame the will, that the soul becomes so<br />
enveloped with the fire of love as to appear consumed thereby.<br />
They make it go forth out of itself, and be renewed, and enter on<br />
another life, as the phoenix from the fire.</p>
<p>24. David, speaking of this, saith, &#8216;My heart hath been inflamed,<br />
and my reins have been changed; and I am brought to nothing, and I<br />
knew not.&#8217; [42] The desires and affections, called the reins by<br />
the prophet, are all stirred and divinely changed in this burning<br />
of the heart, and the soul, through love, melted into nothing,<br />
knowing nothing but love. At this time the changing of the reins<br />
is a great pain, and longing for the vision of God; it seems to<br />
the soul that God treats it with intolerable severity, so much so<br />
that the severity with which love treats it seems to the soul<br />
unendurable, not because it is wounded&#8211;for it considers such<br />
wounds to be its salvation&#8211;but because it is thus suffering from<br />
its love, and because He has not wounded it more deeply so as to<br />
cause death, that it may be united to Him in the life of perfect<br />
love. The soul, therefore, magnifying its sorrows, or revealing<br />
them, says,</p>
<p>&#8216;Having wounded me.&#8217;</p>
<p>25. The soul says in effect, &#8216;Thou hast abandoned me after<br />
wounding me, and Thou hast left me dying of love; and then Thou<br />
hast hidden Thyself as a hart swiftly running away.&#8217; This<br />
impression is most profound in the soul; for by the wound of love,<br />
made in the soul by God, the affections of the will lead most<br />
rapidly to the possession of the Beloved, whose touch it felt, and<br />
as rapidly also, His absence, and its inability to have the<br />
fruition of Him here as it desires. Thereupon succeed the groaning<br />
because of His absence; for these visitations of God are not like<br />
those which recreate and satisfy the soul, because they are rather<br />
for wounding than for healing&#8211;more for afflicting than for<br />
satisfying it, seeing that they tend rather to quicken the<br />
knowledge, and increase the longing, and consequently pain with<br />
the longing for the vision of God. They are called the spiritual<br />
wounds of love, most sweet to the soul and desirable; and,<br />
therefore, when it is thus wounded the soul would willingly die a<br />
thousand deaths, because these wounds make it go forth out of<br />
itself, and enter into God, which is the meaning of the words that<br />
follow:</p>
<p>&#8216;I ran after Thee, crying; but Thou wert gone.&#8217;</p>
<p>26. There can be no remedy for the wounds of love but from Him who<br />
inflicted them. And so the wounded soul, urged by the vehemence of<br />
that burning which the wounds of love occasion, runs after the<br />
Beloved, crying unto Him for relief. This spiritual running after<br />
God has a two-fold meaning. The first is a going forth from all<br />
created things, which is effected by hating and despising them;<br />
the second, a going forth out of oneself, by forgetting self,<br />
which is brought about by the love of God. For when the love of<br />
God touches the soul with that vividness of which we are here<br />
speaking, it so elevates it, that it goes forth not only out of<br />
itself by self-forgetfulness, but it is also drawn away from its<br />
own judgment, natural ways and inclinations, crying after God, &#8216;O<br />
my Bridegroom,&#8217; as if saying, &#8216;By this touch of Thine and wound of<br />
love hast Thou drawn me away not only from all created things, but<br />
also from myself&#8211;for, in truth, soul and body seem now to part&#8211;<br />
and raised me up to Thyself, crying after Thee in detachment from<br />
all things that I might be attached to Thee:</p>
<p>&#8216;Thou wert gone.&#8217;</p>
<p>27. As if saying, &#8216;When I sought Thy presence, I found Thee not;<br />
and I was detached from all things without being able to cling to<br />
Thee&#8211;borne painfully by the gales of love without help in Thee or<br />
in myself.&Otilde; This going forth of the soul in search of the Beloved<br />
is the rising of the bride in the Canticle: &#8216;I will rise and go<br />
about the city; in the streets and the high ways I will seek Him<br />
Whom my soul loveth. I have sought Him and have not found . . .<br />
they wounded me.&#8217; [43] The rising of the bride&#8211;speaking<br />
spiritually&#8211;is from that which is mean to that which is noble;<br />
and is the same with the going forth of the soul out of its own<br />
ways and inferior love to the ennobling love of God. The bride<br />
says that she was wounded because she found him not; [44] so the<br />
soul also says of itself that it is wounded with love and<br />
forsaken; that is, the loving soul is ever in pain during the<br />
absence of the Beloved, because it has given itself up wholly<br />
unto Him hoping for the reward of its self-surrender, the<br />
Possession of the Beloved. Still the Beloved withholds Himself<br />
while the soul has lost all things, and even itself, for Him; it<br />
obtains no compensation for its loss, seeing that it is deprived<br />
of Him whom it loveth.</p>
<p>28. This pain and sense of the absence of God is wont to be so<br />
oppressive in those who are going onwards to the state of<br />
perfection, that they would die if God did not interpose when the<br />
divine wounds are inflicted upon them. As they have the palate of<br />
the will wholesome, and the mind pure and disposed for God, and as<br />
they taste in some degree of the sweetness of divine love, which<br />
they supremely desire, so they also suffer supremely; for, having<br />
but a glimpse of an infinite good which they are not permitted to<br />
enjoy, that is to them an ineffable pain and torment.</p>
