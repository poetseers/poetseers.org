				<p>Of emeralds, and of flowers<br />
In the early morning gathered,<br />
We will make the garlands,<br />
Flowering in Thy love,<br />
And bound together with one hair of my head.</p>
<p>THE bride now turns to the Bridegroom and addresses Him in the<br />
intercourse and comfort of love; the subject of the stanza being<br />
the solace and delight which the bride-soul and the Son of God<br />
find in the possession of the virtues and gifts of each other, and<br />
in the exercise thereof, both rejoicing in their mutual love.<br />
Thus the soul, addressing the Beloved, says that they will make<br />
garlands rich in graces and acquired virtues, obtained at the<br />
fitting and convenient season, beautiful and lovely in the love He<br />
bears the soul, and kept together by the love which it itself has<br />
for Him. This rejoicing in virtue is what is meant by making<br />
garlands, for the soul and God rejoice together in these virtues<br />
bound up as flowers in a garland, in the common love which each<br />
bears the other.</p>
<p>&#8216;Of emeralds, and of flowers.&#8217;</p>
<p>2. The flowers are the virtues of the soul; the emeralds are the<br />
gifts it has received from God. Then of these flowers and emeralds</p>
<p>&#8216;In the early morning gathered.&#8217;</p>
<p>3. That is, acquired in youth, which is the early morning of life.<br />
They are said to be gathered because the virtues which we acquire<br />
in youth are most pleasing unto God; because youth is the season<br />
when our vices most resist the acquisition of them, and when our<br />
natural inclinations are most prone to lose them. Those virtues<br />
also are more perfect which we acquire in early youth. This time<br />
of our life is the early morning; for as the freshness of the<br />
spring morning is more agreeable than any other part of the day,<br />
so also are the virtues acquired in our youth more pleasing in the<br />
sight of God.</p>
<p>4. By the fresh morning we may understand those acts of love by<br />
which we acquire virtue, and which are more pleasing unto God than<br />
the fresh morning is to the sons of men; good works also, wrought<br />
in the season of spiritual dryness and hardness; this is the<br />
freshness of the winter morning, and what we then do for God in<br />
dryness of spirit is most precious in His eyes. Then it is that we<br />
acquire virtues and graces abundantly; and what we then acquire<br />
with toil and labour is for the most part better, more perfect and<br />
lasting than what we acquire in comfort and spiritual sweetness;<br />
for virtue sends forth its roots in the season of dryness, toil,<br />
and trial: as it is written, &#8216;Virtue is made perfect in<br />
infirmity.&#8217; [241] It is with a view to show forth the excellence<br />
of these virtues, of which the garland is wrought for the Beloved,<br />
that the soul says of them that they have been gathered in the<br />
early morning; because it is these flowers alone, with the<br />
emeralds of virtue, the choice and perfect graces, and not the<br />
imperfect, which are pleasing to the Beloved, and so the bride<br />
says:</p>
<p>&#8216;We will make the garlands.&#8217;</p>
<p>5. All the virtues and graces which the soul, and God in it,<br />
acquire are as a garland of divers flowers wherewith the soul is<br />
marvellously adorned as with a vesture of rich embroidery. As<br />
material flowers are gathered, and then formed into a garland, so<br />
the spiritual flowers of virtues and graces are acquired and set<br />
in order in the soul: and when the acquisition is complete, the<br />
garland of perfection is complete also. The soul and the<br />
Bridegroom rejoice in it, both beautiful, adorned with the<br />
garland, as in the state of perfection.</p>
<p>6. These are the garlands which the soul says they will make. That<br />
is, it will wreathe itself with this variety of flowers, with the<br />
emeralds of virtues and perfect gifts, that it may present itself<br />
worthily before the face of the King, and be on an equality with<br />
Him, sitting as a queen on His right hand; for it has merited this<br />
by its beauty. Thus David saith, addressing himself to Christ:<br />
&#8216;The queen stood on Thy right hand in vestments of gold, girt with<br />
variety.&#8217; [242] That is, at His right hand, clad in perfect love,<br />
girt with the variety of graces and perfect virtues.</p>
<p>7. The soul does not say, &#8216;I will make garlands,&#8217; nor &#8216;Thou wilt<br />
make them,&#8217; but, &#8216;We will make them,&#8217; not separately, but both<br />
together; because the soul cannot practise virtues alone, nor<br />
acquire them alone, without the help of God; neither does God<br />
alone create virtue in the soul without the soul&#8217;s concurrence.<br />
Though it be true, as the Apostle saith, that &#8216;every best gift,<br />
and every perfect gift, is from above, descending from the Father<br />
of lights,&#8217; [243] still they enter into no soul without that<br />
soul&#8217;s concurrence and consent. Thus the bride in the Canticle<br />
saith to the Bridegroom; &#8216;Draw me; we will run after thee.&#8217; [244]<br />
Every inclination to good comes from God alone, as we learn here;<br />
but as to running, that is, good works, they proceed from God and<br />
the soul together, and it is therefore written, &#8216;We will run&#8217;&#8211;<br />
that is, both together, but not God nor the soul alone.</p>
<p>8. These words may also be fittingly applied to Christ and His<br />
Church, which, as His bride, says unto Him, &#8216;We will make the<br />
garlands.&#8217; In this application of the words the garlands are the<br />
holy souls born to Christ in the Church. Every such soul is by<br />
itself a garland adorned with the flowers of virtues and graces,<br />
and all of them together a garland for the head of Christ the<br />
Bridegroom.</p>
<p>9. We may also understand by these beautiful garlands the crowns<br />
formed by Christ and the Church, of which there are three kinds.<br />
The first is formed of the beauty and white flowers of the<br />
virgins, each one with her virginal crown, and forming altogether<br />
one crown for the head of the Bridegroom Christ. The second, of<br />
the brilliant flowers of the holy doctors, each with his crown of<br />
doctor, and all together forming one crown above that of the<br />
virgins on the head of Christ. The third is composed of the purple<br />
flowers of the martyrs, each with his own crown of martyrdom, and<br />
all united into one, perfecting that on the head of Christ.<br />
Adorned with these garlands He will be so beautiful, and so lovely<br />
to behold, that heaven itself will repeat the words of the bride<br />
in the Canticle, saying: &#8216;Go forth, ye daughters of Sion, and see<br />
king Solomon in the diadem wherewith his mother crowned him in the<br />
day of his betrothal, and in the day of the joy of his heart.&#8217;<br />
[245] The soul then says we will make garlands.</p>
<p>&#8216;Flowering in Thy love.&#8217;</p>
<p>10. The flowering of good works and virtues is the grace and power<br />
which they derive from the love of God, without which they not<br />
only flower not, but become even dry, and worthless in the eyes of<br />
God, though they may be humanly perfect. But if He gives His grace<br />
and love they flourish in His love.</p>
<p>&#8216;And bound together with one hair of my head.&#8217;</p>
<p>11. The hair is the will of the soul, and the love it bears the<br />
Beloved. This love performs the function of the thread that keeps<br />
the garland together. For as a thread binds the flowers of a<br />
garland, so loves knits together and sustains virtues in the soul.<br />
&#8216;Charity&#8217;&#8211;that is, love&#8211;saith the Apostle, &#8216;is the bond of<br />
perfection.&#8217; [246] Love, in the same way, binds the virtues and<br />
supernatural gifts together, so that when love fails by our<br />
departure from God, all our virtue perishes also, just as the<br />
flowers drop from the garland when the thread that bound them<br />
together is broken. It is not enough for God&#8217;s gift of virtues<br />
that He should love us, but we too must love Him in order to<br />
receive them, and preserve them.</p>
<p>12. The soul speaks of one hair, not of many, to show that the<br />
will by itself is fixed on God, detached from all other hairs;<br />
that is, from strange love. This points out the great price and<br />
worth of these garlands of virtues; for when love is single,<br />
firmly fixed on God, as here described, the virtues also are<br />
entire, perfect, and flowering in the love of God; for the love He<br />
bears the soul is beyond all price, and the soul also knows it<br />
well.</p>
<p>13. Were I to attempt a description of the beauty of that binding<br />
of the flowers and emeralds together, or of the strength and<br />
majesty which their harmonious arrangement furnishes to the soul,<br />
or the beauty and grace of its embroidered vesture, expressions<br />
and words would fail me; for if God says of the evil spirit, &#8216;His<br />
body is like molten shields, shut close up with scales pressing<br />
upon one another, one is joined to another, and not so much as any<br />
air can come between them&#8217;; [247] if the evil spirit be so strong,<br />
clad in malice thus compacted together&#8211;for the scales that cover<br />
his body like molten shields are malice, and malice is in itself<br />
but weakness&#8211;what must be the strength of the soul that is<br />
clothed in virtues so compacted and united together that no<br />
impurity or imperfection can penetrate between them; each virtue<br />
severally adding strength to strength, beauty to beauty, wealth to<br />
wealth, and to majesty, dominion and grandeur?</p>
<p>14. What a marvellous vision will be that of the bride-soul, when<br />
it shall sit on the right hand of the Bridegroom-King, crowned<br />
with graces! &#8216;How beautiful are thy steps in shoes, O prince&#8217;s<br />
daughter!&#8217; [248] The soul is called a prince&#8217;s daughter because of<br />
the power it has; and if the beauty of the steps in shoes be<br />
great, what must be that of the whole vesture? Not only is the<br />
beauty of the soul crowned with admirable flowers, but its<br />
strength also, flowing from the harmonious order of the flowers,<br />
intertwined with the emeralds of its inumerable graces, is<br />
terrible: &#8216;Terrible as the army of a camp set in array.&#8217; [249]<br />
For, as these virtues and gifts of God refresh the soul with their<br />
spiritual perfume, so also, when united in it, do they, out of<br />
their substance, minister strength. Thus, in the Canticle, when<br />
the bride was weak, languishing with love&#8211;because she had not<br />
been able to bind together the flowers and the emeralds with the<br />
hair of her love&#8211;and anxious to strengthen herself by that union<br />
of them, cries out: &#8216;Stay me with flowers, compass me about with<br />
apples; because I languish with love.&#8217; [250] The flowers are the<br />
virtues, and the apples are the other graces.</p>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>I BELIEVE I have now shown how the intertwining of the garlands<br />
and their lasting presence in the soul explain the divine union of<br />
love which now exists between the soul and God. The Bridegroom, as<br />
He saith Himself, is the &Ocirc;flower of the field and the lily of the<br />
valleys,&#8217; [251] and the soul&#8217;s love is the hair that unites to<br />
itself this flower of flowers. Love is the most precious of all<br />
things, because it is the &#8216;bond of perfection,&#8217; as the Apostle<br />
saith, [252] and perfection is union with God. The soul is, as it<br />
were, a sheaf of garlands, for it is the subject of this glory, no<br />
longer what it was before, but the very perfect flower of flowers<br />
in the perfection and beauty of all; for the thread of love binds<br />
so closely God and the soul, and so unites them, that it<br />
transforms them and makes them one by love; so that, though in<br />
essence different, yet in glory and appearance the soul seems God<br />
and God the soul. Such is this marvellous union, baffling all<br />
description.</p>
<p>2. We may form some conception of it from the love of David and<br />
Jonathan, whose &#8216;soul was knit with the soul of David.&#8217; [253] If<br />
the love of one man for another can be thus strong, so as to knit<br />
two souls together, what must that love of God be which can knit<br />
the soul of man to God the Bridegroom? God Himself is here the<br />
suitor Who in the omnipotence of His unfathomable love absorbs the<br />
soul with greater violence and efficacy than a torrent of fire a<br />
single drop of the morning dew which resolves itself into air.<br />
The hair, therefore, which accomplishes such a union must, of<br />
necessity, be most strong and subtile, seeing that it penetrates<br />
and binds together so effectually the soul and God. In the present<br />
stanza the soul declares the qualities of this hair.</p>
