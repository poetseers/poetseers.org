				<p>In Thy footsteps<br />
The young ones run Thy way;<br />
At the touch of the fire<br />
And by the spiced wine,<br />
The divine balsam flows.</p>
<p>HERE the bride gives thanks to her Beloved for three graces which<br />
devout souls receive from Him, by which they encourage and excite<br />
themselves to <a href="http://www.poetseers.org/themes/poems-on-love/index.html">love</a>God more and more. She speaks of them here<br />
because she has had experience of them herself in this state of<br />
union. The first is sweetness, which He gives them, and which is<br />
so efficacious that it makes them run swiftly on the road of<br />
perfection. The second is a visit of <a href="http://www.poetseers.org/themes/poems-on-love/index.html">love,</a> by which they are<br />
suddenly set on fire with love. The third is overflowing charity<br />
infused into them, with which He so inebriates them that they are<br />
as much excited by it as by the visit of love, to utter the<br />
praises of God, and to love Him with all sweetness.</p>
<p>&#8216;In Thy footsteps.&#8217;</p>
<p>2. These are the marks on the ground by which we trace the course<br />
of one we seek. The sweetness and knowledge of Himself which God<br />
communicates to the soul that seeks Him are the footsteps by which<br />
it traces and recognises Him. Thus the soul says to the Word, the<br />
Bridegroom, &#8216;In Thy footsteps&#8217;&#8211;&#8217;in the traces of Thy sweetness<br />
which Thou diffusest, and the odours which Thou scatterest.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;The young ones run Thy way.&#8217;</p>
<p>3. &#8216;Devout souls run with youthful vigour in the sweetness which<br />
Thy footsteps communicate.&#8217; They run in many ways and in various<br />
directions&#8211;each according to the spirit which God bestows and the<br />
vocation He has given&#8211;in the diversified forms of spiritual<br />
service on the road of everlasting life, which is evangelical<br />
perfection, where they meet the Beloved in the union of love, in<br />
spiritual detachment from all things.</p>
<p>4. This sweetness and impression of Himself which God leaves in<br />
the soul render it light and active in running after Him; for the<br />
soul then does little or nothing in its own strength towards<br />
running along this road, being rather attracted by the divine<br />
footsteps, so that it not only advances, but even runs, as I said<br />
before, in many ways. The bride in the Canticle, therefore, prays<br />
for the divine attraction, saying, &#8216;Draw me, we will run after<br />
Thee to the odour of Thy ointments&#8217;; [206] and David saith, &#8216;I<br />
have run the way of Thy commandments, when Thou didst dilate my<br />
heart.&#8217; [207]</p>
<p>&#8216;At the touch of the fire, and by the spiced wine,<br />
the divine balsam flows.&#8217;</p>
<p>5. I said, while explaining the previous lines, that souls run in<br />
His footsteps in the way of exterior works. But the three lines I<br />
have just quoted refer to the interior acts of the will, when<br />
souls are under the influence of the other two graces, and<br />
interior visits of the Beloved. These are the touch of fire, and<br />
spiced wine; and the interior act of the will, which is the result<br />
of these visits, is the flowing of the divine balsam. The contact<br />
of the fire is that most delicate touch of the Beloved which the<br />
soul feels at times even when least expecting it, and which sets<br />
the heart on fire with love, as if a spark of fire had fallen upon<br />
it and made it burn. Then the will, in an instant, like one roused<br />
from sleep, burns with the fire of <a href="http://www.poetseers.org/themes/poems-on-love/index.html">love</a>, longs for God, praises<br />
Him and gives Him thanks, worships and honours Him, and prays to<br />
Him in the sweetness of love.</p>
<p>6. This is the flowing of the divine balsam, which obeys the touch<br />
of the fire that issues forth from the consuming <a href="http://www.poetseers.org/themes/poems-on-love/index.html">love</a> of God which<br />
that fire kindled; the divine balsam which comforts the soul and<br />
heals it with its odour and its substance.</p>
<p>7. The bride in the Canticle speaks of this divine touch, saying,<br />
&#8216;My Beloved put His hand through the opening, and my belly<br />
trembled at His touch.&#8217; [208] The touch of the Beloved is the<br />
touch of love, and His hand is the grace He bestows upon the soul,<br />
and the opening through which He puts His hand is the vocation and<br />
the perfection, at least the degree of perfection of the soul; for<br />
according thereto will His touch be heavier or lighter, in<br />
proportion to its spiritual state. The belly that trembled is the<br />
will, in which the touch is effected, and the trembling is the<br />
stirring up of the desires and affections to love, long for, and<br />
praise God, which is the flowing of the balsam from this touch.</p>
<p>8. &#8216;The spiced wine&#8217; is that exceeding great grace which God<br />
sometimes bestows upon advanced souls, when the Holy Spirit<br />
inebriates them with the sweet, luscious, and strong wine of love.<br />
Hence it is here called spiced wine, for as such wine is prepared<br />
by fermentation with many and divers aromatic and strengthening<br />
herbs; so this love, the gift of God to the perfect, is in the<br />
soul prepared and seasoned with the virtues already acquired. This<br />
love, seasoned with the precious spices, communicates to the soul<br />
such a strong, abundant inebriation when God visits it that it<br />
pours forth with great effect and force those acts of rapturous<br />
praise, love, and worship which I referred to before, and that<br />
with a marvellous longing to labour and to suffer for Him.</p>
<p>9. This sweet inebriation and grace, however, do not pass quickly<br />
away, like the touch of the fire, for they are of longer<br />
continuance. The fire touches and passes, but the effects abide<br />
often; and sometimes the spiced wine continues for a considerable<br />
time, and its effects also; this is the sweet love of the soul,<br />
and continues occasionally a day or two, sometimes even many days<br />
together, though not always in the same degree of intensity,<br />
because it is not in the power of the soul to control it.<br />
Sometimes the soul, without any effort of its own, is conscious of<br />
a most sweet interior inebriation, and of the divine love burning<br />
within, as David saith, &#8216;My heart waxed hot within me, and in my<br />
meditation a fire shall burn.&#8217; [209]</p>
<p>10. The outpourings of this inebriation last sometimes as long as<br />
the inebriation itself. At other times there are no outpourings;<br />
and they are more or less intense when they occur, in proportion<br />
to the greater or less intensity of the inebriation itself. But<br />
the outpourings, or effects of the fire, generally last longer<br />
than the fire which caused them; yea, rather the fire leaves them<br />
behind in the soul, and they are more vehement than those which<br />
proceed from the inebriation, for sometimes this divine fire burns<br />
up and consumes the soul in love.</p>
<p>11. As I have mentioned fermented wine, it will be well to touch<br />
briefly upon the difference between it, when it is old, and new<br />
wine; the difference between old wine and new wine is the same,<br />
and will furnish a little instruction for spiritual men. New wine<br />
has not settled on the lees, and is therefore fermenting; we<br />
cannot ascertain its quality or worth before it has settled, and<br />
the fermentation has ceased, for until then there is great risk of<br />
its corruption. The taste of it is rough and sharp, and an<br />
immoderate draught of it intoxicates. Old wine has settled on the<br />
lees, and ferments no more like new wine; the quality of it is<br />
easily ascertained and it is now very safe from corruption, for<br />
all fermentation which might have proved pernicious has entirely<br />
ceased. Well-fermented wine is very rarely spoiled, the taste of<br />
it is pleasant, and its strength is in its own substance, not in<br />
the taste, and the drinking thereof produces health and a sound<br />
constitution.</p>
<p>12. New lovers are compared to new wine; these are beginners in<br />
the service of God, because the fervour of their love manifests<br />
itself outwardly in the senses; because they have not settled on<br />
the lees of sense, frail and imperfect; and because they measure<br />
the strength of love by the sweetness of it, for it is sensible<br />
sweetness that ordinarily gives them their strength for good<br />
works, and it is by this they are influenced; we must, therefore,<br />
place no confidence in this love till the fermentation has<br />
subsided, with the coarse satisfaction of sense.</p>
<p>13. For as these fervours and sensible warmth may incline men to<br />
good and perfect love, and serve as an excellent means thereto,<br />
when the lees of imperfections are cleared; so also is it very<br />
easy at first, when sensible sweetness is fresh, for the wine of<br />
love to fail, and the sweetness of the new to vanish. New lovers<br />
are always anxious, sensibly tormented by their love; it is<br />
necessary for them to put some restraint upon themselves, for if<br />
they are very active in the strength of this wine, their natural<br />
powers will be ruined with these anxieties and fatigues of the new<br />
wine, which is rough and sharp, and not made sweet in the perfect<br />
fermentation, which then takes place when the anxieties of love<br />
are over, as I shall show immediately.</p>
<p>14. The Wise Man employs the same illustration; saying, &#8216;A new<br />
friend is as new wine; it shall grow old, and thou shalt drink it<br />
with pleasure.&#8217; [210] Old lovers, therefore, who have been tried<br />
and proved in the service of the Bridegroom, are like old wine<br />
settled on the lees; they have no sensible emotions, nor outbursts<br />
of exterior zeal, but they taste the sweetness of the wine of<br />
love, now thoroughly fermented, not sweet to the senses as was<br />
that of the love of beginners, but rather settled within the soul<br />
in the substance and sweetness of the spirit, and in perfect good<br />
works. Such souls as these do not seek after sensible sweetness<br />
and fervours, neither do they wish for them, lest they should<br />
suffer from loathing and weariness; for he who gives the reins to<br />
his desires in matters of sense must of necessity suffer pain and<br />
loathing, both in mind and body.</p>
<p>15. Old lovers, therefore, free from that spiritual sweetness<br />
which has its roots in the senses, suffer neither in sense nor<br />
spirit from the anxieties of love, and thus scarcely ever prove<br />
faithless to God, because they have risen above that which might<br />
be an occasion of falling, namely, the flesh. These now drink of<br />
the wine of love, which is not only fermented and free from the<br />
lees, but spiced also with the aromatic herbs of perfect virtues,<br />
which will not allow it to corrupt, as may happen to new wine.</p>
<p>16. For this cause an old friend is of great price in the eyes of<br />
God: &#8216;Forsake not an old friend, for the new will not be like to<br />
him.&#8217; [211] It is through this wine of love, tried and spiced,<br />
that the divine Beloved produces in the soul that divine<br />
inebriation, under the influence of which it sends forth to God<br />
the sweet and delicious outpourings. The meaning of these three<br />
lines, therefore, is as follows: &#8216;At the touch of the fire, by<br />
which Thou stirrest up the soul, and by the spiced wine with which<br />
Thou dost so lovingly inebriate it, the soul pours forth the acts<br />
and movements of love which are Thy work within it.&#8217;</p>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>SUCH, then, is the state of the blessed soul in the bed of<br />
flowers, where all these blessings, and many more, are granted it.<br />
The seat of that bed is the Son of God, and the hangings of it are<br />
the charity and love of the Bridegroom Himself. The soul now may<br />
say, with the bride, &#8216;His left hand is under my head,&#8217; [212] and<br />
we may therefore say, in truth, that such a soul is clothed in<br />
God, and bathed in the Divinity, and that, not as it were on the<br />
surface, but in the interior spirit, and filled with the divine<br />
delights in the abundance of the spiritual waters of life; for it<br />
experiences that which David says of those who have drawn near<br />
unto God: &#8216;They shall be inebriated with the plenty of Thy house,<br />
and Thou shalt make them drink of the torrent of Thy pleasure, for<br />
with Thee is the fountain of life.&#8217; [213]</p>
<p>2. This fulness will be in the very being of the soul, seeing that<br />
its drink is nothing else but the torrent of delights, and that<br />
torrent the Holy Spirit, as it is written: &#8216;And he showed me a<br />
river of living water, clear as crystal, proceeding from the<br />
throne of God and the Lamb.&Otilde; [214] This water, being the very <a href="http://www.poetseers.org/themes/poems-on-love/index.html">love<br />
</a>itself of God, flows into the soul, so that it drinks of the<br />
torrent of love, which is the spirit of the Bridegroom infused<br />
into the soul in union. Thence the soul in the overflowing of its<br />
love sings the following stanza:</p>
