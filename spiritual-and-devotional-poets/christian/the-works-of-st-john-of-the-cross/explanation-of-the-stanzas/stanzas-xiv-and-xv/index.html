<p>
THE BRIDE </p>
<p>My Beloved is the mountains,<br />
The solitary wooded valleys,<br />
The strange islands,<br />
The roaring torrents,<br />
The whisper of the amorous gales;</p>
<p>The tranquil night<br />
At the approaches of the dawn,<br />
The silent music,<br />
The murmuring solitude,<br />
The supper which revives, and enkindles love.</p>
<p>BEFORE I begin to explain these stanzas, I must observe, in order<br />
that they and those which follow may be better understood, that<br />
this spiritual flight signifies a certain high estate and union of<br />
love, whereunto, after many spiritual exercises, God is wont to<br />
elevate the soul: it is called the spiritual betrothal of the<br />
Word, the Son of God. In the beginning, when this occurs the first<br />
time, God reveals to it great things of Himself, makes it<br />
beautiful in majesty and grandeur, adorns it with graces and<br />
gifts, and endows it with honour, and with the knowledge of<br />
Himself, as a bride is adorned on the day of her betrothal. On<br />
this happy day the soul not only ceases from its anxieties and<br />
loving complaints, but is, moreover, adorned with all grace,<br />
entering into a state of peace and delight, and of the sweetness<br />
of love, as it appears from these stanzas, in which it does<br />
nothing else but recount and praise the magnificence of the<br />
Beloved, which it recognises in Him, and enjoys in the union of<br />
the betrothal.</p>
<p>2. In the stanzas that follow, the soul speaks no more of its<br />
anxieties and sufferings, as before, but of the sweet and peaceful<br />
intercourse of love with the Beloved; for now all its troubles are<br />
over. These two stanzas, which I am about to explain, contain all<br />
that God is wont at this time to bestow upon the soul; but we are<br />
not to suppose that all souls, thus far advanced, receive all that<br />
is here described, either in the same way or in the same degree of<br />
knowledge and of consciousness. Some souls receive more, others<br />
less; some in one way, some in another; and yet all may be in the<br />
state of spiritual betrothal. But in this stanza the highest<br />
possible is spoken of, because that embraces all.</p>
<p>EXPLANATION</p>
<p>3. As in the ark of Noe there were many chambers for the different<br />
kinds of animals, as the Sacred Writings tell us, and &#8216;all food<br />
that may be eaten,&#8217; [133] so the soul, in its flight to the divine<br />
ark of the bosom of God, sees therein not only the many mansions<br />
of which our Lord speaks, but also all the food, that is, all the<br />
magnificence in which the soul may rejoice, and which are here<br />
referred to by the common terms of these stanzas. These are<br />
substantially as follows:</p>
<p>4. In this divine union the soul has a vision and foretaste of<br />
abundant and inestimable riches, and finds there all the repose<br />
and refreshment it desired; it attains to the secrets of God, and<br />
to a strange knowledge of Him, which is the food of those who know<br />
Him most; it is conscious of the awful power of God beyond all<br />
other power and might, tastes of the wonderful sweetness and<br />
delight of the Spirit, finds its true rest and divine light,<br />
drinks deeply of the wisdom of God, which shines forth in the<br />
harmony of the creatures and works of God; it feels itself filled<br />
with all good, emptied, and delivered from all evil, and, above<br />
all, rejoices consciously in the inestimable banquet of love which<br />
confirms it in love. This is the substance of these two stanzas.</p>
<p>5. The bride here says that her Beloved in Himself and to her is<br />
all the objects she enumerates; for in the ecstatic communications<br />
of God the soul feels and understands the truth of the saying of<br />
St. Francis: &#8216;God is mine and all things are mine.&#8217; And because<br />
God is all, and the soul, and the good of all, the communication<br />
in this ecstasy is explained by the consideration that the<br />
goodness of the creatures referred to in these stanzas is a<br />
reflection of His goodness, as will appear from every line<br />
thereof. All that is here set forth is in God eminently in an<br />
infinite way, or rather, every one of these grandeurs is God, and<br />
all of them together are God. Inasmuch as the soul is one with<br />
God, it feels all things to be God according to the words of St.<br />
John: &#8216;What was made, in Him was life.&#8217; [134]</p>
<p>6. But we are not to understand this consciousness of the soul as<br />
if it saw the creatures in God as we see material objects in the<br />
light, but that it feels all things to be God in this fruition of<br />
Him; neither are we to imagine that the soul sees God essentially<br />
and clearly because it has so deep a sense of Him; for this is<br />
only a strong and abundant communication from Him, a glimmering<br />
light of what He is in Himself, by which the soul discerns this<br />
goodness of all things, as I proceed to explain.</p>
<p>&#8216;My Beloved is the mountains.&#8217;</p>
<p>7. Mountains are high fertile, extensive, beautiful, lovely,<br />
flowery, and odorous. These mountains my Beloved is to me.</p>
<p>&#8216;The solitary wooded valleys.&#8217;</p>
<p>8. Solitary valleys are tranquil, pleasant, cooling, shady,<br />
abounding in sweet waters, and by the variety of trees growing in<br />
them, and by the melody of the birds that frequent them, enliven<br />
and delight the senses; their solitude and silence procure us a<br />
refreshing rest. These valleys my Beloved is to me.</p>
<p>&#8216;The strange islands.&#8217;</p>
<p>9. Strange islands are girt by the sea; they are also, because of<br />
the sea, distant and unknown to the commerce of men. They produce<br />
things very different from those with which we are conversant, in<br />
strange ways, and with qualities hitherto unknown, so as to<br />
surprise those who behold them, and fill them with wonder. Thus,<br />
then, by reason of the great and marvellous wonders, and the<br />
strange things that come to our knowledge, far beyond the common<br />
notions of men, which the soul beholds in God, it calls Him the<br />
strange islands. We say of a man that he is strange for one of two<br />
reasons: either because he withdraws himself from the society of<br />
his fellows, or because he is singular or distinguished in his<br />
life and conduct. For these two reasons together God is called<br />
strange by the soul. He is not only all that is strange in<br />
undiscovered islands, but His ways, judgments, and works are also<br />
strange, new, and marvellous to men.</p>
<p>10. It is nothing wonderful that God should be strange to men who<br />
have never seen Him, seeing that He is also strange to the holy<br />
angels and the souls who see Him; for they neither can nor shall<br />
ever see Him perfectly. Yea, even to the day of the last judgment<br />
they will see in Him so much that is new in His deep judgments, in<br />
His acts of mercy and justice, as to excite their wonder more and<br />
more. Thus God is the strange islands not to men only, but to the<br />
angels also; only to Himself is He neither strange nor new.</p>
<p>&#8216;The roaring torrents.&#8217;</p>
<p>11. Torrents have three properties. 1. They overflow all that is<br />
in their course. 2. They fill all hollows. 3. They overpower all<br />
other sounds by their own. And hence the soul, feeling most<br />
sweetly that these three properties belong to God, says, &#8216;My<br />
Beloved is the roaring torrents.&#8217;</p>
<p>12. As to the first property of which the soul is conscious, it<br />
feels itself to be so overwhelmed with the torrent of the Spirit<br />
of God, and so violently overpowered by it, that all the waters in<br />
the world seem to it to have surrounded it, and to have drowned<br />
all its former actions and passions. Though all this be violent,<br />
yet there is nothing painful in it, for these rivers are rivers of<br />
peace, as it is written, God, speaking through Isaias, saying, &#8216;I<br />
will decline upon her, as it were, a flood of peace, and as a<br />
torrent overflowing glory.&#8217; [135] That is, &#8216;I will bring upon the<br />
soul, as it were, a river of peace, and a torrent overflowing with<br />
glory.&#8217; Thus this divine overflowing, like roaring torrents, fills<br />
the soul with peace and glory. The second property the soul feels<br />
is that this divine water is now filling the vessels of its<br />
humility and the emptiness of its desires, as it is written: &#8216;He<br />
hath exalted the humble, and filled the hungry with good.&#8217; [136]<br />
The third property of which the soul is now conscious in the<br />
roaring torrents of the Beloved is a spiritual sound and voice<br />
overpowering all other sounds and voices in the world. The<br />
explanation of this will take a little time.</p>
<p>13. This voice, or this murmuring sound of the waters, is an<br />
overflowing so abundant as to fill the soul with good, and a power<br />
so mighty seizing upon it as to seem not only the sound of many<br />
waters, but a most loud roaring of thunder. But the voice is a<br />
spiritual voice, unattended by material sounds or the pain and<br />
torment of them, but rather with majesty, power, might, delight,<br />
and glory: it is, as it were, a voice, an infinite interior sound<br />
which endows the soul with power and might. The Apostles heard in<br />
spirit this voice when the Holy Ghost descended upon them in the<br />
sound &#8216;as of a mighty wind,&#8217; [137] as we read in the Acts of the<br />
Apostles. In order to manifest this spiritual voice, interiorly<br />
spoken, the sound was heard exteriorly, as of a rushing wind, by<br />
all those who were in Jerusalem. This exterior manifestation<br />
reveals what the Apostles interiorly received, namely, fulness of<br />
power and might.</p>
<p>14. So also when our Lord Jesus prayed to the Father because of<br />
His distress and the rage of His enemies, He heard an interior<br />
voice from heaven, comforting Him in His Sacred Humanity. The<br />
sound, solemn and grave, was heard exteriorly by the Jews, some of<br />
whom said that it thundered: others said, &#8216;An angel hath spoken to<br />
Him.&#8217; [138] The voice outwardly heard was the outward sign and<br />
expression of that strength and power which Christ then inwardly<br />
received in His human nature. We are not to suppose that the soul<br />
does not hear in spirit the spiritual voice because it is also<br />
outwardly heard. The spiritual voice is the effect on the soul of<br />
the audible voice, as material sounds strike the ear, and impress<br />
the meaning of it on the mind. This we learn from David when he<br />
said, &#8216;He will give to His voice the voice of strength;&#8217; [139]<br />
this strength is the interior voice. He will give to His voice&#8211;<br />
that is, the outward voice, audibly heard&#8211;the voice of strength<br />
which is felt within. God is an infinite voice, and communicating<br />
Himself thus to the soul produces the effect of an infinite voice.</p>
<p>15. This voice was heard by St. John, saying in the Apocalypse, &#8216;I<br />
heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters, and as the<br />
voice of great thunder.&#8217; And, lest it should be supposed that a<br />
voice so strong was distressing and harsh, he adds immediately,<br />
&#8216;The voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers harping on<br />
their harps.&#8217; [140] Ezechiel says that this sound as of many<br />
waters was &#8216;as it were the sound of the High God,&#8217; [141]<br />
profoundly and sweetly communicated in it. This voice is infinite,<br />
because, as I have said, it is God Who communicates Himself,<br />
speaking in the soul; but He adapts Himself to each soul, uttering<br />
the voice of strength according to its capacity, in majesty and<br />
joy. And so the bride sings in the Canticle: &#8216;Let Thy voice sound<br />
in my ears, for Thy voice is sweet.&#8217; [142]</p>
<p>&#8216;The whisper of the amorous gales.&#8217;</p>
<p>16. Two things are to be considered here&#8211;gales and whisper. The<br />
amorous gales are the virtues and graces of the Beloved, which,<br />
because of its union with the Bridegroom, play around the soul,<br />
and, most lovingly sent forth, touch it in their own substance.<br />
The whisper of the gales is a most sublime and sweet knowledge of<br />
God and of His attributes, which overflows into the understanding<br />
from the contact of the attributes of God with the substance of<br />
the soul. This is the highest delight of which the soul is capable<br />
in this life.</p>
<p>17. That we may understand this the better, we must keep in mind<br />
that as in a gale two things are observable&#8211;the touch of it, and<br />
the whisper or sound&#8211;so there are two things observable also in<br />
the communications of the Bridegroom&#8211;the sense of delight, and<br />
the understanding of it. As the touch of the air is felt in the<br />
sense of touch, and the whisper of it heard in the ear, so also<br />
the contact of the perfections of the Beloved is felt and enjoyed<br />
in the touch of the soul&#8211;that is, in the substance thereof,<br />
through the instrumentality of the will; and the knowledge of the<br />
attributes of God felt in the hearing of the soul&#8211;that is, in the<br />
understanding.</p>
<p>18. The gale is said to blow amorously when it strikes<br />
deliciously, satisfying his desire who is longing for the<br />
refreshing which it ministers; for it then revives and soothes the<br />
sense of touch, and while the sense of touch is thus soothed, that<br />
of hearing also rejoices and delights in the sound and whisper of<br />
the gale more than the touch in the contact of the air, because<br />
the sense of hearing is more spiritual, or, to speak with greater<br />
correctness, is more nearly connected with the spiritual than is<br />
that of touch, and the delight thereof is more spiritual than is<br />
that of the touch. So also, inasmuch as this touch of God greatly<br />
satisfies and comforts the substance of the soul, sweetly<br />
fulfilling its longing to be received into union; this union, or<br />
touch, is called amorous gales, because, as I said before, the<br />
perfections of the Beloved are by it communicated to the soul<br />
lovingly and sweetly, and through it the whisper of knowledge to<br />
the understanding. It is called whisper, because, as the whisper<br />
of the air penetrates subtiley into the organ of hearing, so this<br />
most subtile and delicate knowledge enters with marvellous<br />
sweetness and delight into the inmost substance of the soul, which<br />
is the highest of all delights.</p>
<p>19. The reason is that substantial knowledge is now communicated<br />
intelligibly, and stripped of all accidents and images, to the<br />
understanding, which philosophers call passive or passible,<br />
because inactive without any natural efforts of its own during<br />
this communication. This is the highest delight of the soul,<br />
because it is in the understanding, which is the seat of fruition,<br />
as theologians teach, and fruition is the vision of God. Some<br />
theologians think, inasmuch as this whisper signifies the<br />
substantial intelligence, that our father Elias had a vision of<br />
God in the delicate whisper of the air, which he heard on the<br />
mount at the mouth of the cave. The Holy Scripture calls it &#8216;the<br />
whistling of a gentle wind,&#8217; [143] because knowledge is begotten<br />
in the understanding by the subtile and delicate communication of<br />
the Spirit. The soul calls it here the whisper of the amorous<br />
gales, because it flows into the understanding from the loving<br />
communication of the perfections of the Beloved. This is why it<br />
is called the whisper of the amorous gales.</p>
<p>20. This divine whisper which enters in by the ear of the soul is<br />
not only substantial knowledge, but a manifestation also of the<br />
truths of the Divinity, and a revelation of the secret mysteries<br />
thereof. For in general, in the Holy Scriptures, every<br />
communication of God said to enter in by the ear is a<br />
manifestation of pure truths to the understanding, or a revelation<br />
of the secrets of God. These are revelations on purely spiritual<br />
visions, and are communicated directly to the soul without the<br />
intervention of the senses, and thus, what God communicates<br />
through the spiritual ear is most profound and most certain. When<br />
St. Paul would express the greatness of the revelations made to<br />
him, he did not say, &#8216;I saw or I perceived secret words,&#8217; but &#8216;I<br />
heard secret words which it is not granted to man to utter.&#8217; [144]<br />
It is thought that St. Paul also saw God, as our father Elias, in<br />
the whisper of a gentle air. For as &#8216;faith cometh by hearing&#8217;&#8211;so<br />
the Apostle teaches&#8211;that is, by the hearing of the material ear,<br />
so also that which the faith teaches, the intelligible truth,<br />
cometh by spiritual hearing.</p>
<p>21. The prophet Job, speaking to God, when He revealed Himself<br />
unto him, teaches the same doctrine, saying, &#8216;With the hearing of<br />
the ear I have heard Thee, but now my eye seeth Thee.&#8217; [145] It is<br />
clear, from this, that to hear with the ear of the soul is to see<br />
with the eye of the passive understanding. He does not say, &#8216;I<br />
heard with the hearing of my ears,&#8217; but &#8216;with the hearing of my<br />
ear&#8217;; nor, &#8216;with the seeing of my eyes,&#8217; but &#8216;with the eye of my<br />
understanding&#8217;; the hearing of the soul is, therefore, the vision<br />
of the understanding.</p>
<p>22. Still, we are not to think that what the soul perceives,<br />
though pure truth, can be the perfect and clear fruition of<br />
Heaven. For though it be free from accidents, as I said before,<br />
[146] it is dim and not clear, because it is contemplation, which<br />
in this life, as St. Dionysius saith, &#8216;is a ray of darkness,&#8217;<br />
[147] and thus we may say that it is a ray and an image of<br />
fruition, because it is in the understanding, which is the seat of<br />
fruition. This substantial truth, called here a whisper, is the<br />
&#8216;eyes desired&#8217; which the Beloved showed to the bride, who, unable<br />
to bear the vision, cried, &#8216;Turn them away, O my Beloved.&#8217; [148]</p>
<p>23. There is a passage in the book of Job which greatly confirms<br />
what I have said of rapture and betrothal, and, because I consider<br />
it to be much to the purpose, I will give it here, though it may<br />
delay us a little, and explain those portions of it which belong<br />
to my subject. The explanation shall be short, and when I shall<br />
have made it, I shall go on to explain the other stanza. The<br />
passage is as follows: &#8216;To me there was spoken a secret word,&#8217;<br />
said Eliphaz the Themanite, &#8216;and, as it were, my ear by stealth<br />
received the veins of its whisper. In the horror of a vision by<br />
night, when deep sleep is wont to hold men, fear held me and<br />
trembling, and all my bones were made sore afraid: and when the<br />
spirit passed before me the hair of my flesh stood upright. There<br />
stood one whose countenance I knew not, an image before mine eyes,<br />
and I heard the voice, as it were, of a gentle wind.&#8217; [149]</p>
<p>24. This passage contains almost all I said about rapture in the<br />
thirteenth stanza, where the bride says: &#8216;Turn them away, O my<br />
Beloved.&#8217; The &#8216;word spoken in secret&#8217; to Eliphaz is that secret<br />
communication which by reason of its greatness the soul was not<br />
able to endure, and, therefore, cried out: &#8216;Turn them away, O my<br />
Beloved.&#8217; Eliphaz says that his &#8216;ear as it were by stealth<br />
received the veins of its whisper.&#8217; By that is meant the pure<br />
substance which the understanding receives, for the &#8216;veins&#8217; here<br />
denote the interior substance. The whisper is that communication<br />
and touch of the virtues whereby the said substance is<br />
communicated to the understanding. It is called a whisper because<br />
of its great gentleness. And the soul calls it the amorous gales<br />
because it is lovingly communicated. It is said to be received as<br />
it were by stealth, for as that which is stolen is alienated, so<br />
this secret is alien to man, speaking in the order of nature,<br />
because that which he received does not appertain to him<br />
naturally, and thus it was not lawful for him to receive it;<br />
neither was it lawful for St. Paul to repeat what he heard. For<br />
this reason the prophet saith twice, &#8216;My secret to myself, my<br />
secret to myself.&#8217; [150]</p>
<p>25. When Eliphaz speaks of the horror of the vision by night, and<br />
of the fear and trembling that seized upon him, he refers to the<br />
awe and dread that comes upon the soul naturally in rapture,<br />
because in its natural strength it is unable, as I said before,<br />
[151] to endure the communication of the Spirit of God. The<br />
prophet gives us to understand that, as when sleep is about to<br />
fall upon men, a certain vision which they call a nightmare is<br />
wont to oppress and terrify them in the interval between sleeping<br />
and waking, which is the moment of the approach of sleep, so in<br />
the spiritual passage between the sleep of natural ignorance and<br />
the waking of the supernatural understanding, which is the<br />
beginning of an ecstasy or rapture, the spiritual vision then<br />
revealed makes the soul fear and tremble.</p>
<p>26. &#8216;All my bones were affrighted&#8217;; that is, were shaken and<br />
disturbed. By this he meant a certain dislocation of the bones<br />
which takes place when the soul falls into an ecstasy. This is<br />
clearly expressed by Daniel when he saw the angel, saying, &#8216;O my<br />
lord, at the sight of thee my joints are loosed.&#8217; [152] &#8216;When the<br />
spirit passed before me&#8217;&#8211;that is, &#8216;When my spirit was made to<br />
transcend the ways and limitations of nature in ecstasies and<br />
raptures&#8217;&#8211;&#8217;the hair of my flesh stood upright&#8217;; that is, &Ocirc;my body<br />
was chilled, and the flesh contracted, like that of a dead man.&#8217;</p>
<p>27. &#8216;There stood One&#8217;&#8211;that is God, Who reveals Himself after this<br />
manner&#8211;&#8217;Whose countenance knew not&#8217;: in these communications or<br />
visions, however high they may be, the soul neither knows nor<br />
beholds the face and being of God. &#8216;An image before my eyes&#8217;; that<br />
is, the knowledge of the secret words was most deep, as it were<br />
the image and face of God; but still this is not the essential<br />
vision of God. &#8216;I heard the voice, as it were, of a gentle wind&#8217;;<br />
this is the whisper of the amorous gales&#8211;that is, of the Beloved<br />
of the soul.</p>
<p>28. But it is not to be supposed that these visits of God are<br />
always attended by such terrors and distress of nature: that<br />
happens to them only who are entering the state of illumination<br />
and perfection, and in this kind of communication; for in others<br />
they come with great sweetness.</p>
<p>STANZA XV</p>
<p>&#8216;THE tranquil night.&#8217; In this spiritual sleep in the bosom of the<br />
Beloved the soul is in possession and fruition of all the calm,<br />
repose, and quiet of a peaceful night, and receives at the same<br />
time in God a certain dim, unfathomable divine intelligence. This<br />
is the reason why it says that the Beloved is to it the tranquil<br />
night.</p>
<p>2. &#8216;At the approaches of the dawn.&#8217; This tranquil night is not<br />
like a night of darkness, but rather like the night when the<br />
sunrise is drawing nigh. This tranquillity and repose in God is<br />
not all darkness to the soul, as the dark night is, but rather<br />
tranquillity and repose in the divine light and in a new knowledge<br />
of God, whereby the mind, most sweetly tranquil, is raised to a<br />
divine light.</p>
<p>3. This divine light is here very appropriately called the<br />
approaches of the dawn, that is, the twilight; for as the twilight<br />
of the morn disperses the darkness of the night and reveals the<br />
light of day, so the mind, tranquil and reposing in God, is raised<br />
up from the darkness of natural knowledge to the morning light of<br />
the supernatural knowledge of God; not clear, indeed, as I have<br />
said, but dim, like the night at the approaches of the dawn. For<br />
as it is then neither wholly night nor wholly day, but, as they<br />
say, twilight, so this solitude and divine repose is neither<br />
perfectly illumined by the divine light nor yet perfectly alien<br />
from it.</p>
<p>4. In this tranquillity the understanding is lifted up in a<br />
strange way above its natural comprehension to the divine light:<br />
it is like a man who, after a profound sleep, opens his eyes to<br />
unexpected light. This knowledge is referred to by David when he<br />
says, &#8216;I have watched, and am become as the lonely sparrow on the<br />
housetop&#8217;; [153] that is, &#8216;I opened the eyes of my understanding<br />
and was raised up above all natural comprehension, lonely, without<br />
them, on the housetop, lifted up above all earthly<br />
considerations.&#8217; He says that he was &#8216;become as the lonely<br />
sparrow,&#8217; because in this kind of contemplation, the spirit has<br />
the properties of the sparrow. These are five in number:<br />
i. It frequents in general high places; and the spirit, in<br />
this state, rises to the highest contemplation.<br />
ii. It is ever turning its face in the direction of the wind,<br />
and the spirit turns its affections thither whence comes the<br />
spirit of love, which is God.<br />
iii. It is in general solitary, abstaining from the<br />
companionship of others, and flying away when any approach it: so<br />
the spirit, in contemplation, is far away from all worldly<br />
thoughts, lonely in its avoidance of them; neither does it consent<br />
to anything except to this solitude in God.<br />
iv. It sings most sweetly, and so also does the spirit at<br />
this time sing unto God; for the praises which it offers up<br />
proceed from the sweetest love, most pleasing to itself, and most<br />
precious in the sight of God.<br />
v. It is of no definite colour; so also is the perfect<br />
spirit, which in this ecstasy is not only without any tinge of<br />
sensual affection or self-love, but also without any particular<br />
consideration of the things of heaven or earth; neither can it<br />
give any account whatever of them, because it has entered into the<br />
abyss of the knowledge of God.</p>
<p>&#8216;The silent music.&#8217;</p>
<p>5. In this silence and tranquillity of the night, and in this<br />
knowledge of the divine light, the soul discerns a marvellous<br />
arrangement and disposition of God&#8217;s wisdom in the diversities of<br />
His creatures and operations. All these, and each one of them,<br />
have a certain correspondence with God, whereby each, by a voice<br />
peculiar to itself, proclaims what there is in itself of God, so<br />
as to form a concert of sublimest melody, transcending all the<br />
harmonies of the world. This is the silent music, because it is<br />
knowledge tranquil and calm, without audible voice; and thus the<br />
sweetness of music and the repose of silence are enjoyed in it.<br />
The soul says that the Beloved is silent music, because this<br />
harmony of spiritual music is in Him understood and felt. He is<br />
not this only, He is also&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8216;The murmuring solitude.&#8217;</p>
<p>6. This is almost the same as the silent music. For though the<br />
music is inaudible to the senses and the natural powers, it is a<br />
solitude most full of sound to the spiritual powers. These powers<br />
being in solitude, emptied of all forms and natural apprehensions,<br />
may well receive in spirit, like a resounding voice, the spiritual<br />
impression of the majesty of God in Himself and in His creatures;<br />
as it happened to St. John, who heard in spirit as it were &#8216;the<br />
voice of harpers harping on their harps.&#8217; [154] St. John heard<br />
this in spirit: it was not material harps that he heard, but a<br />
certain knowledge that he had of the praises of the blessed, which<br />
every one of them, each in his own degree of glory, is continually<br />
singing before God. It is as it were music. For as every one of<br />
the saints had the gifts of God in a different way, so every one<br />
of them sings His praises in a different way, and yet all<br />
harmonise in one concert of love, as in music.</p>
<p>7. In the same way, in this tranquil contemplation, the soul<br />
beholds all creatures, not only the highest, but the lowest also,<br />
each one according to the gift of God to it, sending forth the<br />
voice of its witness to what God is. It beholds each one<br />
magnifying Him in its own way, and possessing Him according to its<br />
particular capacity; and thus all these voices together unite in<br />
one strain in praise of God&#8217;s greatness, wisdom, and marvellous<br />
knowledge. This is the meaning of those words of the Holy Ghost in<br />
the Book of Wisdom: &#8216;The Spirit of our Lord hath replenished the<br />
whole world, and that which containeth all things hath the<br />
knowledge of the voice.&#8217; [155] &#8216;The voice&#8217; is the murmuring<br />
solitude, which the soul is said to know, namely, the witness<br />
which all things bear to God. Inasmuch as the soul hears this<br />
music only in solitude and in estrangement from all outward<br />
things, it calls it silent music and murmuring solitude. These are<br />
the Beloved.</p>
<p>&#8216;The supper which revives, and enkindles love.&#8217;</p>
<p>8. Lovers find recreation, satisfaction, and love in feasts.<br />
And because the Beloved in this sweet communication produces these<br />
three effects in the soul, He is here said to be the supper that<br />
revives, and enkindles love. In Holy Scripture supper signifies<br />
the divine vision, for as supper is the conclusion of the day&#8217;s<br />
labours, and the beginning of the night&#8217;s repose, so the soul in<br />
this tranquil knowledge is made to feel that its trials are over,<br />
the possession of good begun, and its love of God increased.<br />
Hence, then, the Beloved is to the soul the supper that revives,<br />
in being the end of its trials, and that enkindles love, in being<br />
the beginning of the fruition of all good.</p>
<p>9. That we may see more clearly how the Bridegroom is the supper<br />
of the soul, we must refer to those words of the Beloved in the<br />
Apocalypse: &#8216;Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man<br />
shall hear My voice, and open to Me the gate, I will enter in to<br />
him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.&#8217; [156] It is evident<br />
from these words that He brings the supper with Him, which is<br />
nothing else but His own sweetness and delights, wherein He<br />
rejoiceth Himself, and which He, uniting Himself to the soul,<br />
communicates to it, making it a partaker of His joy: for this is<br />
the meaning of &#8216;I will sup with him, and he with Me.&#8217; These words<br />
describe the effect of the divine union of the soul with God,<br />
wherein it shares the very goods of God Himself, Who communicates<br />
them graciously and abundantly to it. Thus the Beloved is Himself<br />
the supper which revives, and enkindles love, refreshing the soul<br />
with His abundance, and enkindling its love in His graciousness.</p>
<p>10. But before I proceed to explain the stanzas which follow, I<br />
must observe that, in the state of betrothal, wherein the soul<br />
enjoys this tranquillity, and wherein it receives all that it can<br />
receive in this life, we are not to suppose its tranquillity to be<br />
perfect, but that the higher part of it is tranquil; for the<br />
sensual part, except in the state of spiritual marriage, never<br />
loses all its imperfect habits, and its powers are never wholly<br />
subdued, as I shall show hereafter. [157] What the soul receives<br />
now is all that it can receive in the state of betrothal, for in<br />
that of the marriage the blessings are greater. Though the bride-<br />
soul has great joy in these visits of the Beloved in the state of<br />
betrothal, still it has to suffer from His absence, to endure<br />
trouble and afflictions in the lower part, and at the hands of the<br />
devil. But all this ceases in the state of spiritual marriage.</p>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>THE bride now in possession of the virtues in their perfection,<br />
whereby she is ordinarily rejoicing in peace when the Beloved<br />
visits her, is now and then in the fruition of the fragrance and<br />
sweetness of those virtues in the highest degree, because the<br />
Beloved touches them within her, just as the sweetness and beauty<br />
of the lilies and other flowers when in their bloom are perceived<br />
when we handle them. For in many of these visits the soul discerns<br />
within itself all its virtues which God has given it; He shedding<br />
light upon them. The soul now, with marvellous joy and sweetness<br />
of love, binds them together and presents them to the Beloved as a<br />
nosegay of beautiful flowers, and the Beloved in accepting them&#8211;<br />
for He truly accepts them then&#8211;accepts thereby a great service.<br />
All this takes place within the soul, feeling that the Beloved is<br />
within it as on His own couch, for the soul presents itself with<br />
the virtues which is the greatest service it can render Him, and<br />
thus this is one of the greatest joys which in its interior<br />
converse with God the soul is wont to receive in presents of this<br />
kind made to the Beloved.</p>
<p>2. The devil, beholding this prosperity of the soul, and in his<br />
great malice envying all the good he sees in it, now uses all his<br />
power, and has recourse to all his devices, in order to thwart it,<br />
if possible, even in the slightest degree. He thinks it of more<br />
consequence to keep back the soul, even for an instant, from this<br />
abundance, bliss, and delight, than to make others fall into many<br />
and mortal sins. Other souls have little or nothing to lose, while<br />
this soul has much, having gained many and great treasures; for<br />
the loss of one grain of refined gold is greater than the loss of<br />
many of the baser metals.</p>
<p>3. The devil here has recourse to the sensual appetites, though<br />
now they can give him generally but little or no help because they<br />
are mortified, and because he cannot turn them to any great<br />
account in distracting the imagination. Sometimes he stirs up many<br />
movements in the sensitive part of the soul, and causes other<br />
vexations, spiritual as well as sensual, from which the soul is<br />
unable to deliver itself until our Lord shall send His angel, as<br />
it is written, &#8216;The angel of the Lord shall put in himself about<br />
them that fear Him, and shall deliver them;&#8217; [158] and so<br />
establish peace, both in the spiritual and sensitive parts of the<br />
soul. With a view to show forth this truth, and to ask this<br />
favour, the soul, apprehensive by experience of the craft which<br />
the devil makes use of to thwart this good, addressing itself to<br />
the angels, whose function it is to succour it at this time by<br />
putting the evil spirits to flight, speaks as in the following<br />
stanza:</p>
