				<p>
Turn them away, O my Beloved!<br />
I am on the Wing. </p>
<p>THE BRIDEGROOM</p>
<p>Return, My Dove!<br />
The wounded hart<br />
Looms on the hill<br />
In the air of thy flight and is refreshed.</p>
<p>EXPLANATION</p>
<p>AMID those fervent affections of love, such as the soul has shown<br />
in the preceding stanzas, the Beloved is wont to visit His bride,<br />
tenderly, lovingly, and with great strength of love; for<br />
ordinarily the graces and visits of God are great in proportion to<br />
the greatness of those fervours and longings of love which have<br />
gone before. And, as the soul has so anxiously longed for the<br />
divine eyes&#8211;as in the foregoing stanza&#8211;the Beloved reveals to it<br />
some glimpses of His majesty and Godhead, according to its<br />
desires. These divine rays strike the soul so profoundly and so<br />
vividly that it is rapt into an ecstasy which in the beginning is<br />
attended with great suffering and natural fear. Hence the soul,<br />
unable to bear the ecstasies in a body so frail, cries out, &#8216;Turn<br />
away thine eyes from me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Turn them away, O my Beloved!&#8217;</p>
<p>2. That is, &#8216;Thy divine eyes, for they make me fly away out of<br />
myself to the heights of contemplation, and my natural force<br />
cannot bear it.&#8217; This the soul says because it thinks it has<br />
escaped from the burden of the flesh, which was the object of its<br />
desires; it therefore prays the Beloved to turn away His eyes;<br />
that is, not to show them in the body where it cannot bear and<br />
enjoy them as it would, but to show them to it in its flight from<br />
the body. The Bridegroom at once denies the request and hinders<br />
the flight, saying, &#8216;Return, My Dove! for the communications I<br />
make to thee now are not those of the state of glory wherein thou<br />
desirest to be; but return to Me, for I am He Whom thou, wounded<br />
with love, art seeking, and I, too, as the hart, wounded with thy<br />
love, begin to show Myself to thee on the heights of<br />
contemplation, and am refreshed and delighted by the love which<br />
thy contemplation involves.&#8217; The soul then says to the Bridegroom:</p>
<p>&#8216;Turn them away, O my Beloved!&#8217;</p>
<p>3. The soul, because of its intense longing after the divine eyes&#8211;<br />
that is, the Godhead&#8211;receives interiorly from the Beloved such<br />
communications and knowledge of God as compel it to cry out, &#8216;Turn<br />
them away, O my Beloved!&#8217; For such is the wretchedness of our<br />
mortal nature, that we cannot bear&#8211;even when it is offered to us&#8211;<br />
but at the cost of our life, that which is the very life of the<br />
soul, and the object of its earnest desires, namely, the knowledge<br />
of the Beloved. Thus the soul is compelled to say, with regard to<br />
the eyes so earnestly, so anxiously sought for, and in so many<br />
ways&#8211;when they become visible&#8211;&#8217;Turn them away.&#8217;</p>
<p>4. So great, at times, is the suffering of the soul during these<br />
ecstatic visitations&#8211;and there is no other pain which so wrenches<br />
the very bones, and which so oppresses our natural forces&#8211;that,<br />
were it not for the special interference of God, death would<br />
ensue. And, in truth, such is it to the soul, the subject of these<br />
visitations, for it feels as if it were released from the body and<br />
a stranger to the flesh. Such graces cannot be perfectly received<br />
in the body, because the spirit of man is lifted up to the<br />
communion of the Spirit of God, Who visits the soul, and must<br />
therefore of necessity be in some measure a stranger to the body.<br />
Hence it is that the flesh has to suffer, and consequently the<br />
soul in it, by reason of their union in one person. The great<br />
agony of the soul, therefore, in these visitations, and the great<br />
fear that overwhelms it when God deals with it in the supernatural<br />
way, [123] force it to cry out, &#8216;Turn them away, O my Beloved!&#8217;</p>
<p>5. But it is not to be supposed, however, that the soul really<br />
wishes Him to turn away His eyes; for this is nothing else but the<br />
expression of natural awe, as I said before. [124] Yea, rather,<br />
cost they what they may, the soul would not willingly miss these<br />
visitations and favours of the Beloved; for though nature may<br />
suffer, the spirit flies to this supernatural recollection in<br />
order to enjoy the spirit of the Beloved, the object of its<br />
prayers and desires. The soul is unwilling to receive these<br />
visitations in the body, when it cannot have the perfect fruition<br />
of them, and only in a slight degree and in pain; but it covets<br />
them in the flight of the disembodied spirit when it can enjoy<br />
them freely. Hence it says, &#8216;Turn them away, my Beloved&#8217;&#8211;that is,<br />
Do not visit me in the flesh.</p>
<p>&#8216;I am on the wing.&#8217;</p>
<p>6. It is as if it said, &#8216;I am taking my flight out of the body,<br />
that Thou mayest show them when I shall have left it; they being<br />
the cause of my flight out of the body.&#8217; For the better<br />
understanding of the nature of this flight we should consider that<br />
which I said just now. [125] In this visitation of the divine<br />
Spirit the spirit of the soul is with great violence borne upwards<br />
into communion with the divine, the body is abandoned, all its<br />
acts and senses are suspended, because they are absorbed in God.<br />
Thus the Apostle, St. Paul, speaking of his own ecstasy, saith,<br />
&#8216;Whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot tell.&#8217; [126] But<br />
we are not to suppose that the soul abandons the body, and that<br />
the natural life is destroyed, but only that its actions have then<br />
ceased.</p>
<p>7. This is the reason why the body remains insensible in raptures<br />
and ecstasies, and unconscious of the most painful inflictions.<br />
These are not like the swoons and faintings of the natural life,<br />
which cease when pain begins. They who have not arrived at<br />
perfection are liable to these visitations, for they happen to<br />
those who are walking in the way of proficients. They who are<br />
already perfect receive these visitations in peace and in the<br />
sweetness of love: ecstasies cease, for they were only graces to<br />
prepare them for this greater grace.</p>
<p>8. This is a fitting place for discussing the difference between<br />
raptures, ecstasies, other elevations and subtile flights of the<br />
spirit, to which spiritual persons are liable; but, as I intend to<br />
do nothing more than explain briefly this canticle, as I undertook<br />
in the prologue, I leave the subject for those who are better<br />
qualified than I am. I do this the more readily, because our<br />
mother, the blessed Teresa of Jesus, has written admirably on this<br />
matter, [127] whose writings I hope in God to see published soon.<br />
The flight of the soul in this place, then, is to be understood of<br />
ecstasy, and elevation of spirit in God. The Beloved immediately<br />
says:</p>
<p>&#8216;Return, My Dove.&#8217;</p>
<p>9. The soul was joyfully quitting the body in its spiritual<br />
flight, thinking that its natural life was over, and that it was<br />
about to enter into the everlasting fruition of the Bridegroom,<br />
and remain with Him without a veil between them. He, however,<br />
restrains it in its flight, saying:</p>
<p>&#8216;Return, My Dove.&#8217;</p>
<p>10. It is as if He said, &#8216;O My Dove, in thy high and rapid flight<br />
of contemplation, in the love wherewith thou art inflamed, in the<br />
simplicity of thy regard&#8217;&#8211;these are three characteristics of the<br />
dove&#8211;&#8217;return from that flight in which thou aimest at the true<br />
fruition of Myself&#8211;the time is not yet come for knowledge so<br />
high&#8211;return, and submit thyself to that lower degree of it which<br />
I communicate in this thy rapture.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;The wounded hart.&#8217;</p>
<p>11. The Bridegroom likens Himself to a hart, for by the hart here<br />
He means Himself. The hart by nature climbs up to high places, and<br />
when wounded hastens to seek relief in the cooling waters. If he<br />
hears his consort moan and sees that she is wounded, he runs to<br />
her at once, comforts, and caresses her. So the Bridegroom now;<br />
for, seeing the bride wounded with His love, He, too, hearing her<br />
moaning, is wounded Himself with her love; for with lovers the<br />
wound of one is the wound of the other, and they have the same<br />
feelings in common. The Bridegroom, therefore, saith in effect:<br />
&#8216;Return, my bride, to Me; for as thou art wounded with the love of<br />
Me, I too, like the hart, am wounded by love for thee. I am like<br />
the hart, looming on the top of the hill.&#8217; Therefore He says:</p>
<p>&#8216;Looms on the hill.&#8217;</p>
<p>12. That is, &#8216;on the heights of contemplation, to which thou hast<br />
ascended in thy flight.&#8217; Contemplation is a lofty eminence where<br />
God, in this life, begins to communicate Himself to the soul, and<br />
to show Himself, but not distinctly. Hence it is said, &#8216;Looms on<br />
the hill,&#8217; because He does not appear clearly. However profound<br />
the knowledge of Himself which God may grant to the soul in this<br />
life, it is, after all, but an indistinct vision. We now come to<br />
the third property of the hart, the subject of the line that<br />
follows:</p>
<p>&#8216;In the air of thy flight, and is refreshed.&#8217;</p>
<p>13. The flight is contemplation in the ecstasy spoken of before,<br />
[128] and the air is the spirit of love produced in the soul by<br />
this flight of contemplation, and this love produced by the flight<br />
is here with great propriety called &#8216;air,&#8217; for the Holy Ghost also<br />
is likened to air in the Sacred Writings, because He is the breath<br />
of the Father and the Son. And so as He is there the air of the<br />
flight&#8211;that is, that He proceeds by the will from the<br />
contemplation and wisdom of the Father and the Son, and is<br />
breathed&#8211;so here the love of the soul is called air by the<br />
Bridegroom, because it proceeds from the contemplation of God and<br />
the knowledge of Him which at this time is possessed by the soul.</p>
<p>14. We must observe here that the Bridegroom does not say that He<br />
cometh at the flight, but at the air of the flight, because<br />
properly speaking God does not communicate Himself to the soul<br />
because of that flight, which is, as I have said, the knowledge it<br />
has of God, but because of the love which is the fruit of that<br />
knowledge. For as love is the union of the Father and the Son, so<br />
is it also of God and the soul.</p>
<p>15. Hence it is that notwithstanding the most profound knowledge<br />
of God, and contemplation itself, together with the knowledge of<br />
all mysteries, the soul without love is nothing worth, and can do<br />
nothing, as the Apostle saith, towards its union with God. [129]<br />
In another place he saith, &#8216;Have charity, which is the bond of<br />
perfection.&#8217; [130] This charity then and love of the soul make the<br />
Bridegroom run to drink of the fountain of the Bride&#8217;s love, as<br />
the cooling waters attract the thirsty and the wounded hart, to be<br />
refreshed therein.</p>
<p>&#8216;And is refreshed.&#8217;</p>
<p>16. As the air cools and refreshes him who is wearied with the<br />
heat, so the air of love refreshes and comforts him who burns with<br />
the fire of love. The fire of love hath this property, the air<br />
which cools and refreshes it is an increase of the fire itself. To<br />
him who loves, love is a flame that burns with the desire of<br />
burning more and more, like the flame of material fire. The<br />
consummation of this desire of burning more and more, with the<br />
love of the bride, which is the air of her flight, is here called<br />
refreshment. The Bridegroom says in substance, &#8216;I burn more and<br />
more because of the ardour of thy flight, for love kindles love.&#8217;</p>
<p>17. God does not establish His grace and love in the soul but in<br />
proportion to the good will of that soul&#8217;s love. He, therefore,<br />
that truly loves God must strive that his love fail not; for so,<br />
if we may thus speak, will he move God to show him greater love,<br />
and to take greater delight in his soul. In order to attain to<br />
such a degree of love, he must practise those things of which the<br />
Apostle speaks, saying: &#8216;Charity is patient, is benign: charity<br />
envieth not, dealeth not perversely; is not puffed up, is not<br />
ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinketh<br />
not evil, rejoiceth not upon iniquity, but rejoiceth with the<br />
truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all<br />
things, endureth all things.&#8217; [131]</p>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>WHEN the dove&#8211;that is the soul&#8211;was flying on the gale of love<br />
over the waters of the deluge of the weariness and longing of its<br />
love, &#8216;not finding where her foot might rest,&#8217; [132] the<br />
compassionate father Noe, in this last flight, put forth the hand<br />
of his mercy, caught her, and brought her into the ark of his<br />
charity and love. That took place when the Bridegroom, as in the<br />
stanza now explained, said, &#8216;Return, My Dove.&#8217; In the shelter<br />
within the ark, the soul, finding all it desired, and more than it<br />
can ever express, begins to sing the praises of the Beloved,<br />
celebrating the magnificence which it feels and enjoys in that<br />
union, saying:</p>
