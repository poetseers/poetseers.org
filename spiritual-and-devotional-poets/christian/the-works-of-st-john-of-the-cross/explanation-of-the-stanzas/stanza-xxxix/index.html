				<p>The breathing of the air,<br />
The song of the sweet nightingale,<br />
The grove and its beauty<br />
In the serene night,<br />
With the flame that consumes, and gives no pain.</p>
<p>THE soul refers here, under five different expressions, to that<br />
which the Bridegroom is to give it in the beatific transformation.<br />
1. The aspiration of the Holy Spirit of God after it, and its own<br />
aspiration after God. 2. Joyous praise of God in the fruition of<br />
Him. 3. The knowledge of creatures and the order of them. 4. The<br />
pure and clear contemplation of the divine essence. 5. Perfect<br />
transformation in the infinite love of God.</p>
<p>&#8216;The breathing of the air.&#8217;</p>
<p>2. This is a certain faculty which God will there give the soul in<br />
the communication of the Holy Ghost, Who, like one breathing,<br />
raises the soul by His divine aspiration, informs it, strengthens<br />
it, so that it too may breathe in God with the same aspiration of<br />
love which the Father breathes with the Son, and the Son with the<br />
Father, which is the Holy Ghost Himself, Who is breathed into the<br />
soul in the Father and the Son in that transformation so as to<br />
unite it to Himself; for the transformation will not be true and<br />
perfect if the soul is not transformed in the Three Persons of the<br />
Most Holy Trinity in a clear manifest degree. This breathing of<br />
the Holy Ghost in the soul, whereby God transforms it in Himself,<br />
is to the soul a joy so deep, so exquisite, and so grand that no<br />
mortal tongue can describe it, no human understanding, as such,<br />
conceive it in any degree; for even that which passes in the soul<br />
with respect to the communication which takes place in its<br />
transformation wrought in this life cannot be described, because<br />
the soul united with God and transformed in Him breathes in God<br />
that very divine aspiration which God breathes Himself in the soul<br />
when it is transformed in Him.</p>
<p>3. In the transformation which takes place in this life, this<br />
breathing of God in the soul, and of the soul in God, is of most<br />
frequent occurrence, and the source of the most exquisite delight<br />
of love to the soul, but not however in the clear and manifest<br />
degree which it will have in the life to come. This, in my<br />
opinion, is what St. Paul referred to when he said: &#8216;Because you<br />
are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of His Son into your hearts,<br />
crying Abba, Father.&#8217; [313] The blessed in the life to come, and<br />
the perfect in this, thus experience it.</p>
<p>4. Nor is it to be thought possible that the soul should be<br />
capable of so great a thing as that it should breathe in God as<br />
God in it, in the way of participation. For granting that God has<br />
bestowed upon it so great a favour as to unite it to the most Holy<br />
Trinity, whereby it becomes like unto God, and God by<br />
participation, is it altogether incredible that it should exercise<br />
the faculties of its understanding, perform its acts of knowledge<br />
and of love, or, to speak more accurately, should have it all done<br />
in the Holy Trinity together with It, as the Holy Trinity itself?<br />
This, however, takes place by communication and participation, God<br />
Himself effecting it in the soul, for this is &#8216;to be transformed<br />
in the Three Persons&#8217; in power, wisdom, and love, and herein it is<br />
that the soul becomes like unto God, Who, that it might come to<br />
this, created it to His own image and likeness.</p>
<p>5. How this can be so cannot be explained in any other way than by<br />
showing how the Son of God has raised us to so high a state, and<br />
merited for us the &#8216;power to be made the sons of God.&#8217; [314] He<br />
prayed to the Father, saying: &#8216;Father, I will that where I am they<br />
also whom Thou hast given Me may be with Me, that they may see My<br />
glory which Thou hast given Me.&#8217; [315] That is, &#8216;that they may do<br />
by participation in Us what I do naturally, namely, breathe the<br />
Holy Ghost.&#8217; He says also: &#8216;Not for them only do I pray, but for<br />
them also who through their word shall believe in Me; that they<br />
all may be one, as Thou, Father, in Me, and I in Thee, that they<br />
also may be one in Us: that the world may believe that Thou hast<br />
sent Me. And the glory which Thou hast given Me, I have given to<br />
them: that they may be one as We also are one. I in them and Thou<br />
in Me, that they may be made perfect in one, and the world may<br />
know that Thou hast sent Me, and hast loved them as Thou hast also<br />
loved Me,&#8217; [316]&#8211;that is, in bestowing upon them that love which<br />
He bestows upon the Son, though not naturally as upon Him, but in<br />
the way I speak of, in the union and transformation of love.</p>
<p>6. We are not to suppose from this that our Lord prayed that the<br />
saints might become one in essence and nature, as the Father and<br />
the Son are; but that they might become one in the union of love<br />
as the Father and the Son are one in the oneness of love. Souls<br />
have by participation that very God which the Son has by nature,<br />
and are therefore really gods by participation like unto God and<br />
of His society.</p>
<p>7. St. Peter speaks of this as follows: &#8216;Grace to you and peace be<br />
accomplished in the knowledge of God, and Christ Jesus our Lord;<br />
as all things of His divine power, which pertain to life and<br />
godliness, are given us by the knowledge of Him Who hath called us<br />
by His own proper glory and virtue, by Whom He hath given us most<br />
great and precious promises: that by these you may be made<br />
partakers of the divine nature.&#8217; [317] Thus far St. Peter, who<br />
clearly teaches that the soul will be a partaker of God Himself,<br />
and will do, together with Him, the work of the Most Holy Trinity,<br />
because of the substantial union between the soul and God. And<br />
though this union be perfect only in the life to come, yet even in<br />
this, in the state of perfection, which the soul is said now to<br />
have attained, some anticipation of its sweetness is given it, in<br />
the way I am speaking of, though in a manner wholly ineffable.</p>
<p>8. O souls created for this and called thereto, what are you<br />
doing? What are your occupations? Your aim is meanness, and your<br />
enjoyments misery. Oh, wretched blindness of the children of Adam,<br />
blind to so great a light, and deaf to so clear a voice; you see<br />
not that, while seeking after greatness and glory, you are<br />
miserable and contemptible, ignorant, and unworthy of blessings so<br />
great. I now proceed to the second expression which the soul has<br />
made use of to describe that which He gave it.</p>
<p>&#8216;The song of the sweet nightingale.&#8217;</p>
<p>9. Out of this &#8216;breathing of the air&#8217; comes the sweet voice of the<br />
Beloved addressing Himself to the soul, in which the soul sends<br />
forth its own sweet song of joy to Him. Both are meant by the song<br />
of the nightingale. As the song of the nightingale is heard in the<br />
spring of the year, when the cold, and rain, and changes of winter<br />
are past, filling the ear with melody, and the mind with joy; so,<br />
in the true intercourse and transformation of love, which takes<br />
place in this life, the bride, now protected and delivered from<br />
all trials and changes of the world, detached, and free from the<br />
imperfections, sufferings, and darkness both of mind and body,<br />
becomes conscious of a new spring in liberty, largeness, and joy<br />
of spirit, in which she hears the sweet voice of the Bridegroom,<br />
Who is her sweet nightingale, renewing and refreshing the very<br />
substance of her soul, now prepared for the journey of everlasting<br />
life.</p>
<p>10. That voice is sweet to her ears, and calls her sweetly, as it<br />
is written: &#8216;Arise, make haste, My love, My dove, My beautiful one,<br />
and come. For winter is now past, the rain is over and gone. The<br />
flowers have appeared in our land, the time of pruning is come:<br />
the voice of the turtle is heard in our land.&#8217; [318] When the<br />
bride hears the voice of the Bridegroom in her inmost soul, she<br />
feels that her troubles are over and her prosperity begun. In the<br />
refreshing comfort and sweet sense of this voice she, too, like<br />
the nightingale, sends forth a new song of rejoicing unto God, in<br />
unison with Him Who now moves her to do so.</p>
<p>11. It is for this that the Beloved sings, that the bride in<br />
unison with Him may sing unto God; this is the aim and desire of<br />
the Bridegroom, that the soul should sing with the spirit joyously<br />
unto God; and this is what He asks of the bride in the Canticle:<br />
&#8216;Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come; my dove in the clefts<br />
of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall, show me thy face,<br />
let thy voice sound in my ears.&#8217; [319]</p>
<p>12. The ears of God signify the desire He hath that the soul<br />
should sing in perfect joy. And that this song may be perfect, the<br />
Bridegroom bids the soul to send it forth, and to let it sound in<br />
the clefts of the rock, that is, in the transformation which is<br />
the fruit of the mysteries of Christ, of which I spoke just now.<br />
[320] And because in this union of the soul with God, the soul<br />
sings unto Him together with Him, in the way I spoke of when I was<br />
speaking of love, [321] the song of praise is most perfect and<br />
pleasing unto God; for the acts of the soul, in the state of<br />
perfection, are most perfect; and thus the song of its rejoicing<br />
is sweet unto God as well as to itself.</p>
<p>13. &#8216;Thy voice is sweet,&#8217; [322] saith the Bridegroom, &#8216;not only<br />
to thee, but also to Me, for as we are one, thy voice is also in<br />
unison and one with Mine.&#8217; This is the Canticle which the soul<br />
sings in the transformation which takes place in this life, about<br />
which no exaggeration is possible. But as this song is not so<br />
perfect as the new song in the life of glory, the soul, having a<br />
foretaste of that by what it feels on earth, shadows forth by the<br />
grandeur of this the magnificence of that in glory, which is<br />
beyond all comparison nobler, and calls it to mind and says that<br />
what its portion there will be is the song of the sweet<br />
nightingale.</p>
<p>&#8216;The grove and its beauty.&#8217;</p>
<p>14. This is the third thing which the Bridegroom is to give the<br />
soul. The grove, because it contains many plants and animals,<br />
signifies God as the Creator and Giver of life to all creatures,<br />
which have their being and origin from Him, reveal Him and make<br />
Him known as the Creator. The beauty of the grove, which the soul<br />
prays for, is not only the grace, wisdom, and loveliness which<br />
flow from God over all created things, whether in heaven or on<br />
earth, but also the beauty of the mutual harmony and wise<br />
arrangement of the inferior creation, and the higher also, and of<br />
the mutual relations of both. The knowledge of this gives the soul<br />
great joy and delight. The fourth request is:</p>
<p>&#8216;In the serene night.&#8217;</p>
<p>15. That is, contemplation, in which the soul desires to behold<br />
the grove. It is called night, because contemplation is dim; and<br />
that is the reason why it is also called mystical theology&#8211;that<br />
is, the secret or hidden wisdom of God, where, without the sound<br />
of words, or the intervention of any bodily or spiritual sense, as<br />
it were in silence and in repose, in the darkness of sense and<br />
nature, God teaches the soul&#8211;and the soul knows not how&#8211;in a<br />
most secret and hidden way.</p>
<p>16. Some spiritual writers call this &#8216;understanding without<br />
understanding,&#8217; because it does not take place in what<br />
philosophers call the active understanding which is conversant<br />
with the forms, fancies, and apprehensions of the physical<br />
faculties, but in the understanding as it is possible and passive,<br />
which without receiving such forms receives passively only the<br />
substantial knowledge of them free from all imagery. This occurs<br />
without effort or exertion on its part, and for this reason<br />
contemplation is called night, in which the soul through the<br />
channel of its transformation learns in this life that it already<br />
possesses, in a supreme degree, this divine grove, together with<br />
its beauty.</p>
<p>17. Still, however clear may be its knowledge, it is dark night<br />
in comparison with that of the blessed, for which the soul prays.<br />
Hence, while it prays for the clear contemplation, that is, the<br />
fruition of the grove, and its beauty; with the other objects here<br />
enumerated, it says, let it be in the night now serene; that is,<br />
in the clear beatific contemplation: let the night of dim<br />
contemplation cease here below, and change into the clear<br />
contemplation of the serene vision of God above. Thus the serene<br />
night is the clear and unclouded contemplation of the face of God.<br />
It was to this night of contemplation that David referred when he<br />
said, &#8216;Night shall be my light in my pleasures&#8217;; [323] that is,<br />
when I shall have my delight in the essential vision of God, the<br />
night of contemplation will have dawned in the day and light of my<br />
understanding</p>
<p>&#8216;With the flame that consumes, and gives no pain.&#8217;</p>
<p>18. This flame is the love of the Holy Ghost. &#8216;Consumes&#8217; means<br />
absolute perfection. Therefore, when the soul says that the<br />
Beloved will give it all that is mentioned in this stanza, and<br />
that they will be its possession in love absolute and perfect, all<br />
of them and itself with them in perfect love, and that without<br />
pain, its purpose is to show forth the utter perfection of love.<br />
Love, to be perfect, must have these two properties: it must<br />
consume and transform the soul in God; the burning and<br />
transformation wrought in the soul by the flame must give no pain.<br />
But this can be only in the state of the blessed, where the flame<br />
is sweet love, for in this transformation of the soul therein<br />
there is a blessed agreement and contentment on both sides, and no<br />
change to a greater or less degree gives pain, as before, when the<br />
soul had attained to the state of perfect love.</p>
<p>19. But the soul having attained to this state abides in its love<br />
of God, a love so like His and so sweet, God being, as Moses<br />
saith, [324] a consuming fire&#8211;&#8217;the Lord thy God is a consuming<br />
fire&#8217;&#8211;that it perfects and renews it. But this transformation is<br />
not like that which is wrought in this life, which though most<br />
perfect and in love consummate was still in some measure consuming<br />
the soul and wearing it away. It was like fire in burning coals,<br />
for though the coals may be transformed into fire, and made like<br />
it, and ceased from seething, and smoke no longer arises from them<br />
as before they were wholly transformed into fire, still, though<br />
they have become perfect fire, the fire consumes them and reduces<br />
them to ashes.</p>
<p>20. So is it with the soul which in this life is transformed by<br />
perfect love: for though it be wholly conformed, yet it still<br />
suffers, in some measure, both pain and loss. Pain, on account of<br />
the beatific transformation which is still wanting; loss, through<br />
the weakness and corruption of the flesh coming in contact with<br />
love so strong and so deep; for everything that is grand hurts and<br />
pains our natural infirmity, as it is written, &#8216;The corruptible<br />
body is a load upon the soul.&#8217; [315] But in the life of bliss<br />
there will be neither loss nor pain, though the sense of the soul<br />
will be most acute, and its love without measure, for God will<br />
give power to the former and strength to the latter, perfecting<br />
the understanding in His wisdom and the will in His love.</p>
<p>21. As, in the foregoing stanzas, and in the one which follows,<br />
the bride prays for the boundless knowledge of God, for which she<br />
requires the strongest and the deepest love that she may love Him<br />
in proportion to the grandeur of His communications, she prays now<br />
that all these things may be bestowed upon her in love<br />
consummated, perfect, and strong.</p>
