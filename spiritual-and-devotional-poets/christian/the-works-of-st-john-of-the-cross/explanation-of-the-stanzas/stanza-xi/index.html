				<p></p>
<p>Reveal Thy presence,<br />
And let the vision and Thy beauty kill me,<br />
Behold the malady<br />
Of love is incurable<br />
Except in Thy presence and before Thy face.</p>
<p>THE soul, anxious to be possessed by God, Who is so great, Whose<br />
love has wounded and stolen its heart, and unable to suffer more,<br />
beseeches Him directly, in this stanza, to reveal His beauty&#8211;that<br />
is, the divine Essence&#8211;and to slay it in that vision, separating<br />
it from the body, in which it can neither see nor possess Him as<br />
it desires. And further, setting before Him the distress and<br />
sorrow of heart, in which it continues, suffering it because of<br />
its love, and unable to find any other remedy than the glorious<br />
vision of the divine essence, cries out: &#8216;Reveal Thy presence.&#8217;</p>
<p>2. To understand this clearly we must remember that there are<br />
three ways in which God is present in the soul. The first is His<br />
presence in essence, not in holy souls only, but in wretched and<br />
sinful souls as well, and also in all created things; for it is by<br />
this presence that He gives life and being, and were it once<br />
withdrawn all things would return to nothing. [93] This presence<br />
never fails in the soul.</p>
<p>3. The second is His presence by grace, whereby He dwells in the<br />
soul, pleased and satisfied with it. This presence is not in all<br />
souls; for those who fall into mortal sin lose it, and no soul can<br />
know in a natural way whether it has it or not. The third is His<br />
presence by spiritual affection. God is wont to show His presence<br />
in many devout souls in divers ways, in refreshment, joy, and<br />
gladness; yet this, like the others, is all secret, for He does<br />
not show Himself as He is, because the condition of our mortal<br />
life does not admit of it. Thus this prayer of the soul may be<br />
understood of any one of them.</p>
<p>&#8216;Reveal Thy presence.&#8217;</p>
<p>4. Inasmuch as it is certain that God is ever present in the soul,<br />
at least in the first way, the soul does not say, &#8216;Be Thou<br />
present&#8217;; but, &#8216;Reveal and manifest Thy hidden presence, whether<br />
natural, spiritual, or affective, in such a way that I may behold<br />
Thee in Thy divine essence and beauty.&#8217; The soul prays Him that as<br />
He by His essential presence gives it its natural being, and<br />
perfects it by His presence of grace, so also He would glorify it<br />
by the manifestation of His glory. But as the soul is now loving<br />
God with fervent affections, the presence, for the revelation of<br />
which it prays the Beloved to manifest, is to be understood<br />
chiefly of the affective presence of the Beloved. Such is the<br />
nature of this presence that the soul felt there was an infinite<br />
being hidden there, out of which God communicated to it certain<br />
obscure visions of His own divine beauty. Such was the effect of<br />
these visions that the soul longed and fainted away with the<br />
desire of that which is hidden in that presence.</p>
<p>5. This is in harmony with the experience of David, when he said:<br />
&#8216;My soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of our Lord.&#8217; [94]<br />
The soul now faints with desire of being absorbed in the<br />
Sovereign Good which it feels to be present and hidden; for<br />
though it be hidden, the soul is most profoundly conscious of the<br />
good and delight which are there. The soul is therefore attracted<br />
to this good with more violence than matter is to its centre, and<br />
is unable to contain itself, by reason of the force of this<br />
attraction, from saying:</p>
<p>&#8216;Reveal Thy presence.&#8217;</p>
<p>6. Moses, on Mount Sinai in the presence of God, saw such glimpses<br />
of the majesty and beauty of His hidden Divinity, that, unable to<br />
endure it, he prayed twice for the vision of His glory saying:<br />
&#8216;Whereas Thou hast said: I know thee by name, and thou hast found<br />
grace in my sight. If, therefore, I have found grace in Thy sight,<br />
shew me Thy face, that I may know Thee and may find grace before<br />
Thine eyes;&#8217; [95] that is, the grace which he longed for&#8211;to<br />
attain to the perfect love of the glory of God. The answer of our<br />
Lord was: &#8216;Thou canst not see My face, for man shall not see Me<br />
and live.&#8217; [96] It is as if God had said: &#8216;Moses, thy prayer is<br />
difficult to grant; the beauty of My face, and the joy in seeing<br />
Me is so great, as to be more than thy soul can bear in a mortal<br />
body that is so weak.&#8217; The soul accordingly, conscious of this<br />
truth, either because of the answer made to Moses or also because<br />
of that which I spoke of before, [97] namely, the feeling that<br />
there is something still in the presence of God here which it<br />
could not see in its beauty in the life it is now living,<br />
because, as I said before, [98] it faints when it sees but a<br />
glimpse of it. Hence it comes that it anticipates the answer<br />
that may be given to it, as it was to Moses, and says:</p>
<p>&#8216;Let the vision and Thy beauty kill me.&#8217;</p>
<p>7. That is, &#8216;Since the vision of Thee and Thy beauty is so full of<br />
delight that I cannot endure, but must die in the act of beholding<br />
them, let the vision and Thy beauty kill me.&#8217;</p>
<p>8. Two visions are said to be fatal to man, because he cannot bear<br />
them and live. One, that of the basilisk, at the sight of which<br />
men are said to die at once. The other is the vision of God; but<br />
there is a great difference between them. The former kills by<br />
poison, the other with infinite health and bliss. It is,<br />
therefore, nothing strange for the soul to desire to die by<br />
beholding the beauty of God in order to enjoy Him for ever. If the<br />
soul had but one single glimpse of the majesty and beauty of God,<br />
not only would it desire to die once in order to see Him for ever,<br />
as it desires now, but would most joyfully undergo a thousand most<br />
bitter deaths to see Him even for a moment, and having seen Him<br />
would suffer as many deaths again to see Him for another moment.</p>
<p>9. It is necessary to observe for the better explanation of this<br />
line, that the soul is now speaking conditionally, when it prays<br />
that the vision and beauty may slay it; it assumes that the vision<br />
must be preceded by death, for if it were possible before death,<br />
the soul would not pray for death, because the desire of death is<br />
a natural imperfection. The soul, therefore, takes it for granted<br />
that this corruptible life cannot coexist with the incorruptible<br />
life of God, and says:</p>
<p>&#8216;Let the vision and Thy beauty kill me.&#8217;</p>
<p>10. St. Paul teaches this doctrine to the Corinthians when he<br />
says: &#8216;We would not be spoiled, but overclothed, that that which<br />
is mortal may be swallowed up of life,&#8217; [99] That is, &#8216;we would<br />
not be divested of the flesh, but invested with glory.&#8217; But<br />
reflecting that he could not live in glory and in a mortal body<br />
at the same time, he says to the Philippians: &#8216;having a desire to<br />
be dissolved and to be with Christ.&#8217; [100]</p>
<p>11. Here arises this question, Why did the people of Israel of old<br />
dread and avoid the vision of God, that they might not die, as it<br />
appears they did from the words of Manue to his wife, &#8216;We shall<br />
die because we have seen God,&#8217; [101] when the soul desires to die<br />
of that vision? To this question two answers may be given.</p>
<p>12. In those days men could not see God, though dying in the state<br />
of grace, because Christ had not come, It was therefore more<br />
profitable for them to live in the flesh, increasing in merit, and<br />
enjoying their natural life, than to be in Limbus, incapable of<br />
meriting, suffering in the darkness and in the spiritual absence<br />
of God. They therefore considered it a great grace and blessing to<br />
live long upon earth.</p>
<p>13. The second answer is founded on considerations drawn from the<br />
love of God. They in those days, not being so confirmed in love,<br />
nor so near to God by love, were afraid of the vision: but, now,<br />
under the law of grace, when, on the death of the body, the soul<br />
may behold God, it is more profitable to live but a short time,<br />
and then to die in order to see Him. And even if the vision were<br />
withheld, the soul that really loves God will not be afraid to die<br />
at the sight of Him; for true love accepts with perfect <br />
resignation, and in the same spirit, and even with joy, whatever<br />
comes to it from the hands of the Beloved, whether prosperity or<br />
adversity&#8211;yea, and even chastisements such as He shall be pleased<br />
to send, for, as St. John saith, &#8216;perfect charity casteth out<br />
fear.&#8217; [102]</p>
<p>14. Thus, then, there is no bitterness in death to the soul that<br />
loves, when it brings with it all the sweetness and delights of<br />
love; there is no sadness in the remembrance of it when it opens<br />
the door to all joy; nor can it be painful and oppressive, when it<br />
is the end of all unhappiness and sorrow, and the beginning of all<br />
good. Yea, the soul looks upon it as a friend and its bride, and<br />
exults in the recollection of it as the day of espousals; it<br />
yearns for the day and hour of death more than the kings of the<br />
earth for principalities and kingdoms.</p>
<p>15. It was of this kind of death that the wise man said, &#8216;O death,<br />
thy judgment is good to the needy man.&#8217; [103] If it be good to the<br />
needy man, though it does not supply his wants, but on the<br />
contrary deprives him even of what he hath, how much more good<br />
will it be to the soul in need of love and which is crying for<br />
more, when it will not only not rob it of the love it hath<br />
already, but will be the occasion of that fulness of love which it<br />
yearns for, and is the supply of all its necessities. It is not<br />
without reason, then, that the soul ventures to say:</p>
<p>&#8216;Let the vision and Thy beauty kill me.&#8217;</p>
<p>16. The soul knows well that in the instant of that vision it will<br />
be itself absorbed and transformed into that beauty, and be made<br />
beautiful like it, enriched, and abounding in beauty as that<br />
beauty itself. This is why David said, &#8216;Precious in the sight of<br />
the Lord is the death of His saints,&#8217; [104] but that could not be<br />
if they did not become partakers of His glory, for there is<br />
nothing precious in the eyes of God except that which He is<br />
Himself, and therefore, the soul, when it loves, fears not death,<br />
but rather desires it. But the sinner is always afraid to die,<br />
because he suspects that death will deprive him of all good, and<br />
inflict upon him all evil; for in the words of David, &#8216;the death<br />
of the wicked is very evil,&#8217; [105] and therefore, as the wise man<br />
saith, the very thought of it is bitter: &#8216;O death, how bitter is<br />
thy memory to a man that hath peace in his riches!&#8217; [106] The<br />
wicked love this life greatly, and the next but little, and are<br />
therefore afraid of death; but the soul that loves God lives more<br />
in the next life than in this, because it lives rather where it<br />
loves than where it dwells, and therefore esteeming but lightly<br />
its present bodily life, cries out: &#8216;Let the vision and Thy beauty<br />
kill me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Behold, the malady of love is incurable,<br />
except in Thy presence and before Thy face.&#8217;</p>
<p>17. The reason why the malady of love admits of no other remedy<br />
than the presence and countenance of the Beloved is, that the<br />
malady of love differs from every other sickness, and therefore<br />
requires a different remedy. In other diseases, according to sound<br />
philosophy, contraries are cured by contraries; but love is not<br />
cured but by that which is in harmony with itself. The reason is<br />
that the health of the soul consists in the love of God; and so<br />
when that love is not perfect, its health is not perfect, and the<br />
soul is therefore sick, for sickness is nothing else but a failure<br />
of health. Thus, that soul which loves not at all is dead; but<br />
when it loves a little, how little soever that may be, it is then<br />
alive, though exceedingly weak and sick because it loves God so<br />
little. But the more its love increases, the greater will be its<br />
health, and when its love is perfect, then, too, its health also<br />
is perfect. Love is not perfect until the lovers become so on an<br />
equality as to be mutually transformed into one another; then love<br />
is wholly perfect.</p>
<p>18. And because the soul is now conscious of a certain adumbration<br />
of love, which is the malady of which it here speaks, yearning to<br />
be made like to Him of whom it is a shadow, that is the<br />
Bridegroom, the Word, the Son of God, Who, as St. Paul saith, is<br />
the &#8216;splendour of His glory, and the figure of His substance;&#8217;<br />
[107] and because it is into this figure it desires to be<br />
transformed by love, cries out, &#8216;Behold, the malady of love is<br />
incurable except in Thy presence, and in the light of Thy<br />
Countenance.&#8217; The love that is imperfect is rightly called a<br />
malady, because as a sick man is enfeebled and cannot work, so the<br />
soul that is weak in love is also enfeebled and cannot practise<br />
heroic virtue.</p>
<p>19. Another explanation of these words is this: he who feels this<br />
malady of love&#8211;that is, a failure of it&#8211;has an evidence in<br />
himself that he has some love, because he ascertains what is<br />
deficient in him by that which he possesses. But he who is not<br />
conscious of this malady has evidence therein that he has no love<br />
at all, or that he has already attained to perfect love.</p>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>THE soul now conscious of a vehement longing after God, like a<br />
stone rushing to its centre, and like wax which has begun to<br />
receive the impression of the seal which it cannot perfectly<br />
represent, and knowing, moreover, that it is like a picture<br />
lightly sketched, crying for the artist to finish his work, and<br />
having its faith so clear as to trace most distinctly certain<br />
divine glimpses of the majesty of God, knows not what else to do<br />
but to turn inward to that faith&#8211;as involving and veiling the<br />
