				<p>In the inner cellar<br />
Of my Beloved have I drunk; and when I went forth<br />
Over all the plain<br />
I knew nothing,<br />
And lost the flock I followed before.</p>
<p>HERE the soul speaks of that sovereign grace of God in taking it<br />
to Himself into the house of His love, which is the union, or<br />
transformation of love in God. It describes two effects proceeding<br />
therefrom: forgetfulness of, and detachment from, all the things<br />
of this world, and the mortification of its tastes and desires.</p>
<p>&#8216;In the inner cellar.&#8217;</p>
<p>2. In order to explain in any degree the meaning of this, I have<br />
need of the special help of the Holy Ghost to direct my hand and<br />
guide my pen. The cellar is the highest degree of love to which<br />
the soul may attain in this life, and is therefore said to be the<br />
inner. It follows from this that there are other cellars not so<br />
interior; that is, the degrees of love by which souls reach this,<br />
the last. These cellars are seven in number, and the soul has<br />
entered into them all when it has in perfection the seven gifts of<br />
the Holy Ghost, so far as it is possible for it. When the soul has<br />
the spirit of fear in perfection, it has in perfection also the<br />
spirit of love, inasmuch as this fear, the last of the seven<br />
gifts, is filial fear, and the perfect fear of a son proceeds from<br />
his perfect love of his father. Thus when the Holy Scripture<br />
speaks of one as having perfect charity, it says of him that he<br />
fears God. So the prophet Isaias, announcing the perfections of<br />
Christ, saith of Him, &#8216;The spirit of the fear of the Lord shall<br />
replenish him.&#8217; [215] Holy Simeon also is spoken of by the<br />
Evangelist as a &#8216;just man full of fear,&#8217; [216] and the same<br />
applies to many others.</p>
<p>3. Many souls reach and enter the first cellar, each according to<br />
the perfection of its love, but the last and inmost cellar is<br />
entered by few in this world, because therein is wrought the<br />
perfect union with God, the union of the spiritual marriage, of<br />
which the soul is now speaking. What God communicates to the soul<br />
in this intimate union is utterly ineffable, beyond the reach of<br />
all possible words&#8211;just as it is impossible to speak of God<br />
Himself so as to convey any idea of what He is&#8211;because it is God<br />
Himself who communicates Himself to the soul now in the marvellous<br />
bliss of its transformation. In this state God and the soul are<br />
united, as the window is with the light, or coal with the fire, or<br />
the light of the stars with that of the sun, yet, however, not so<br />
essentially and completely as it will be in the life to come. The<br />
soul, therefore, to show what it received from the hands of God in<br />
the cellar of wine, says nothing else, and I do not believe that<br />
anything could be said but the words which follow:</p>
<p>&#8216;Of my Beloved have I drunk.&#8217;</p>
<p>4. As a draught diffuses itself through all the members and veins<br />
of the body, so this communication of God diffuses itself<br />
substantially in the whole soul, or rather, the soul is<br />
transformed in God. In this transformation the soul drinks of God<br />
in its very substance and its spiritual powers. In the<br />
understanding it drinks wisdom and knowledge, in the will the<br />
sweetest love, in the memory refreshment and delight in the<br />
thought and sense of its bliss. That the soul receives and drinks<br />
delight in its very substance, appears from the words of the bride<br />
in the Canticle: &#8216;My soul melted as He spoke&#8217; [217]&#8211;that is, when<br />
the Bridegroom communicated Himself to the soul.</p>
<p>5. That the understanding drinks wisdom is evident from the words<br />
of the bride longing and praying for the kiss of union: &#8216;There<br />
Thou shalt teach me, and I will give thee a cup of spiced wine.&#8217;<br />
[218] &#8216;Thou shalt teach me wisdom and knowledge in love, and I<br />
will give Thee a cup of spiced wine&#8211;that is, my love mingled with<br />
Thine.&#8217; The bride says that the will also drinks of love, saying:<br />
&#8216;He brought me into the cellar of wine; He hath ordered in me<br />
charity,&#8217; [219]&#8211;that is, &#8216;He gave me His love, embracing me, to<br />
drink of love&#8217;; or, to speak more clearly, &#8216;He ordered in me His<br />
charity, tempering His charity and to the purpose making it mine.&#8217;<br />
This is to give the soul to drink of the very love of its Beloved,<br />
which the Beloved infuses into it.</p>
<p>6. There is a common saying that the will cannot love that of<br />
which the understanding has no knowledge. This, however, is to be<br />
understood in the order of nature, it being impossible, in a<br />
natural way, to love anything unless we first know what it is we<br />
love. But in a supernatural way God can certainly infuse love and<br />
increase it without infusing and increasing distinct knowledge, as<br />
is evident from the texts already quoted. Yea, many spiritual<br />
persons have experience of this; their love of God burns more and<br />
more, while their knowledge does not grow. Men may know little and<br />
love much, and on the other hand, know much and love but little.</p>
<p>7. In general, those spiritual persons whose knowledge of God is<br />
not very great are usually very rich in all that belongs to the<br />
will, and infused faith suffices them for this knowledge, by means<br />
of which God infuses and increases charity in them and the acts<br />
thereof, which are to love Him more and more though knowledge is<br />
not increased. Thus the will may drink of love while the<br />
understanding drinks in no fresh knowledge. In the present<br />
instance, however, all the powers of the soul together, because of<br />
the union in the inner cellar, drink of the Beloved.</p>
<p>8. As to the memory, it is clear that the soul drinks of the<br />
Beloved in it, because it is enlightened with the light of the<br />
understanding in remembering the blessings it possesses and enjoys<br />
in union with the Beloved.</p>
<p>&#8216;And when I went forth.&#8217;</p>
<p>9. That is, after this grace: the divine draught having so deified<br />
the soul, exalted it, and inebriated it in God. Though the soul be<br />
always in the high estate of marriage ever since God has placed it<br />
there, nevertheless actual union in all its powers is not<br />
continuous, though the substantial union is. In this substantial<br />
union the powers of the soul are most frequently in union, and<br />
drink of His cellar, the understanding by knowledge, the will by<br />
love, etc. We are not, therefore, to suppose that the soul, when<br />
saying that it went out, has ceased from its substantial or<br />
essential union with God, but only from the union of its<br />
faculties, which is not, and cannot be, permanent in this life; it<br />
is from this union, then, it went forth when it wandered over all<br />
the plain&#8211;that is, through the whole breadth of the world.</p>
<p>&#8216;I knew nothing.&#8217;</p>
<p>10. This draught of God&#8217;s most deep wisdom makes the soul forget<br />
all the things of this world, and consider all its previous<br />
knowledge, and the knowledge of the whole world besides, as pure<br />
ignorance in comparison with this knowledge.</p>
<p>11. For a clearer understanding of this, we must remember that the<br />
most regular cause of the soul&#8217;s ignoring the things of the world,<br />
when it has ascended to this high state, is that it is informed by<br />
a supernatural knowledge, in the presence of which all natural and<br />
worldly knowledge is ignorance rather than knowledge. For the soul<br />
in possession of this knowledge, which is most profound, learns<br />
from it that all other knowledge not included in this knowledge is<br />
not knowledge, but ignorance, and worthless. We have this truth in<br />
the words of the Apostle when he said that &#8216;the wisdom of this<br />
world is foolishness with God.&#8217; [220]</p>
<p>12. This is the reason why the soul says it knows nothing, now<br />
that it has drunk of the divine wisdom. The truth is that the<br />
wisdom of men and of the whole world is mere ignorance, and not<br />
deserving any attention, but it is a truth that can be learned<br />
only in that truth of the presence of God in the soul<br />
communicating to it His wisdom and making it strong by this<br />
draught of love that it may see it distinctly. This is taught us<br />
by Solomon, saying: &#8216;The vision that the man spake, with whom God<br />
is, and who being strengthened by God abiding with him, said: I am<br />
the most foolish of men, and the wisdom of men is not with me.&#8217;<br />
[221]</p>
<p>13. When the soul is raised to this high wisdom of God, the wisdom<br />
of man is in its eyes the lowest ignorance: all natural science<br />
and the works of God, if accompanied by ignorance of Him, are as<br />
ignorance; for where He is not known, there nothing is known. &#8216;The<br />
deep things of God are foolishness to men.&#8217; [222] Thus the<br />
divinely wise and the worldly wise are fools in the estimation of<br />
each other; for the latter cannot understand the wisdom and<br />
science of God, nor the former those of the world, for the wisdom<br />
of the world is ignorance in comparison with the wisdom of God;<br />
and the wisdom of God is ignorance with respect to that of the<br />
world.</p>
<p>14. Moreover, this deification and elevation of the spirit in God,<br />
whereby the soul is, as it were, rapt and absorbed in love, one<br />
with God, suffer it not to dwell upon any worldly matter. The soul<br />
is now detached, not only from all outward things, but even from<br />
itself: it is, as it were, undone, assumed by, and dissolved in,<br />
love&#8211;that is, it passes out of itself into the Beloved. Thus the<br />
bride, in the Canticle, after speaking of her own transformation<br />
by love into the Beloved, expresses her state of ignorance by the<br />
words &#8216;I knew not.&#8217; [223] The soul is now, in a certain sense,<br />
like Adam in paradise, who knew no evil. It is so innocent that it<br />
sees no evil; neither does it consider anything to be amiss. It<br />
will hear much that is evil, and will see it with its eyes, and<br />
yet it shall not be able to understand it, because it has no evil<br />
habits whereby to judge of it. God has rooted out of it those<br />
imperfect habits and that ignorance resulting from the evil of<br />
sin, by the perfect habit of true wisdom. Thus, also, the soul<br />
knows nothing on this subject.</p>
<p>15. Such a soul will scarcely intermeddle with the affairs of<br />
others, because it forgets even its own; for the work of the<br />
Spirit of God in the soul in which He dwells is to incline it to<br />
ignore those things which do not concern it, especially such as do<br />
not minister to edification. The Spirit of God abides within the<br />
soul to withdraw it from outward things rather than to lead it<br />
among them; and thus the soul knows nothing as it knew it<br />
formerly. We are not, however, to suppose that it loses the habits<br />
of knowledge previously acquired, for those habits are improved by<br />
the more perfect habit of supernatural knowledge infused, though<br />
these habits be not so powerful as to necessitate knowledge<br />
through them, and yet there is no reason why they should not do so<br />
occasionally.</p>
<p>16. In this union of the divine wisdom, these habits are united<br />
with the higher wisdom of other knowledge, as a little light with<br />
another which is great; it is the great light that shines,<br />
overwhelming the less, yet the latter is not therefore lost, but<br />
rather perfected, though it be not the light which shines pre-<br />
eminently. Thus, I imagine, will it be in heaven; the acquired<br />
habits of knowledge in the just will not be destroyed, though they<br />
will be of no great importance there, seeing that the just will<br />
know more in the divine wisdom than by the habits acquired on<br />
earth.</p>
<p>17. But the particular notions and forms of things, acts of the<br />
imagination, and every other apprehension having form and figure<br />
are all lost and ignored in this absorbing love, and this for two<br />
reasons. First, the soul cannot actually attend to anything of the<br />
kind, because it is actually absorbed by this draught of love.<br />
Secondly, and this is the principal reason, its transformation in<br />
God so conforms it to His purity and simplicity&#8211;for there is no<br />
form or imaginary figure in Him&#8211;as to render it pure, cleansed<br />
and empty of all the forms and figures it entertained before,<br />
being now purified and enlightened in simple contemplation. All<br />
spots and stains in the glass become invisible when the sun shines<br />
upon it, but they appear again as soon as the light of the sun is<br />
withheld.</p>
<p>18. So is it with the soul; while the effects of this act of love<br />
continue, this ignorance continues also, so that it cannot observe<br />
anything in particular until these effects have ceased. Love has<br />
set the soul on fire and transmuted it into love, has annihilated<br />
it and destroyed it as to all that is not love, according to the<br />
words of David: &#8216;My heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have<br />
been changed; and I am brought to nothing, and I knew not.&#8217; [224]<br />
The changing of the reins, because the heart is inflamed, is the<br />
changing of the soul, in all its desires and actions, in God, into<br />
a new manner of life, the utter undoing and annihilation of the<br />
old man, and therefore the prophet said that he was brought to<br />
nothing and knew not.</p>
<p>19. These are the two effects of drinking the wine of the cellar<br />
of God; not only is all previous knowledge brought to nothing and<br />
made to vanish, but the old life also with its imperfections is<br />
destroyed, and into the new man renewed; this is the second of the<br />
two effects described in the words that follow:</p>
<p>&#8216;And lost the flock I followed before.&#8217;</p>
<p>20. Until the soul reaches the state of perfection, however<br />
spiritual it may be, there always remains a troop of desires,<br />
likings, and other imperfections, sometimes natural, sometimes<br />
spiritual, after which it runs, and which it tries to feed while<br />
following and satisfying them. With regard to the understanding,<br />
there are certain imperfections of the desire of knowledge. With<br />
regard to the will, certain likings and peculiar desires, at times<br />
in temporal things, as the wish to possess certain trifles, and<br />
attachment to some things more than to others, certain prejudices,<br />
considerations, and punctilios, with other vanities, still<br />
savouring of the world: and again in natural things, such as<br />
eating and drinking, the preference of one kind of food over<br />
another, and the choice of the best: at another time, in spiritual<br />
things, such as seeking for sweetness, and other follies of<br />
spiritual persons not yet perfect, too numerous to recount here.<br />
As to the memory, there are many inconsistencies, anxieties,<br />
unseemly reminiscences, which drag the soul captive after them.</p>
<p>21. The four passions of the soul also involve it in many useless<br />
hopes, joys, griefs, and fears, after which it runs. As to this<br />
flock, some men are more influenced by it than others; they run<br />
after and follow it, until they enter the inner cellar, where they<br />
lose it altogether, being then transformed in love. In that cellar<br />
the flock of imperfections is easily destroyed, as rust and mould<br />
on metal in the fire. Then the soul feels itself free from the<br />
pettiness of self-likings and the vanities after which it ran<br />
before, and may well say, &#8216;I have lost the flock which I followed<br />
before.&#8217;</p>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>GODcommunicates Himself to the soul in this interior union with a<br />
love so intense that the <a href="http://www.poetseers.org/themes/poems-on-love/index.html">love</a> of a mother, who so tenderly<br />
caresses her child, the love of a brother, or the affection of a<br />
friend bear no likeness to it, for so great is the tenderness, and<br />
so deep is the <a href="http://www.poetseers.org/themes/poems-on-love/index.html">love</a> with which the Infinite Father comforts and<br />
exalts the humble and loving soul. O wonders worthy of all awe and<br />
reverence! He humbles Himself in reality before that soul that He<br />
may exalt it, as if He were its servant, and the soul His lord. He<br />
is as anxious to comfort it as if He were a slave, and the soul<br />
God. So great is the humility and tenderness of God. In this<br />
communion of love He renders in a certain way those services to<br />
the soul which He says in the Gospel He will perform for the elect<br />
in heaven. &#8216;Amen, I say to you, that He will gird Himself and make<br />
them sit down to meat, and passing will minister unto them.&#8217; [225]</p>
<p>2. This very service He renders now to the soul, comforting and<br />
cherishing it, as a mother her child whom she nurtures in her<br />
bosom. And the soul recognisesherein the truth of the words of<br />
Isaias, &#8216;You shall be carried at the breasts, and upon the knees<br />
they shall caress you.&#8217; [226] What must the feelings of the soul<br />
be amid these sovereign graces? How it will melt away in <a href="http://www.poetseers.org/themes/poems-on-love/index.html">love</a>,<br />
beholding the bosom of God opened for it with such overflowing<br />
love. When the soul perceives itself in the midst of these<br />
delights, it surrenders itself wholly to God, gives to Him the<br />
breasts of its own will and <a href="http://www.poetseers.org/themes/poems-on-love/index.html">love</a>, and under the influence thereof<br />
addresses the Beloved in the words of the bride in the Canticle,<br />
saying: &#8216;I to my Beloved, and His turning is towards me. Come, my<br />
Beloved, let us go forth into the field, let us abide in the<br />
villages. Let us rise early to the vineyards, let us see if the<br />
vineyard flourish, if the flowers be ready to bring forth fruits,<br />
if the pomegranates flourish; there will I give Thee my breasts&#8217;<br />
[227]&#8211;that is, &#8216;I will employ all the joy and strength of my will<br />
in the service of Thy <a href="http://www.poetseers.org/themes/poems-on-love/index.html">love</a>.&#8217; This mutual surrender in this union<br />
of the soul and God is the subject of the stanza which follows:</p>
