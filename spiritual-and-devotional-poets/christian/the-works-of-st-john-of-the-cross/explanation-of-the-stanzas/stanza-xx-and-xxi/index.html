				<p>THE BRIDEGROOM</p>
<p>Light-winged birds,<br />
Lions, fawns, bounding does,<br />
Mountains, valleys, strands,<br />
Waters, winds, heat,<br />
And the terrors that keep watch by night;</p>
<p>By the soft lyres<br />
And the siren strains, I adjure you,<br />
Let your fury cease,<br />
And touch not the wall,<br />
That the bride may sleep in greater security.</p>
<p>HERE the Son of God, the Bridegroom, leads the bride into the<br />
enjoyment of peace and tranquillity in the conformity of her lower<br />
to her higher nature, purging away all her imperfections,<br />
subjecting the natural powers of the soul to reason, and<br />
mortifying all her desires, as it is expressed in these two<br />
stanzas, the meaning of which is as follows. In the first place<br />
the Bridegroom adjures and commands all vain distractions of the<br />
fancy and imagination from henceforth to cease, and controls the<br />
irascible and concupiscible faculties which were hitherto the<br />
sources of so much affliction. He brings, so far as it is possible<br />
in this life, the three powers of memory, understanding, and will<br />
to the perfection of their objects, and then adjures and commands<br />
the four passions of the soul, joy, hope, grief, and fear, to be<br />
still, and bids them from henceforth be moderate and calm.</p>
<p>2. All these passions and faculties are comprehended under the<br />
expressions employed in the first stanza, the operations of which,<br />
full of trouble, the Bridegroom subdues by that great sweetness,<br />
joy, and courage which the bride enjoys in the spiritual surrender<br />
of Himself to her which God makes at this time; under the<br />
influence of which, because God transforms the soul effectually in<br />
Himself, all the faculties, desires, and movements of the soul<br />
lose their natural imperfection and become divine.</p>
<p>&#8216;Light-winged birds.&#8217;</p>
<p>3. These are the distractions of the imagination, light and rapid<br />
in their flight from one subject to another. When the will is<br />
tranquilly enjoying the sweet converse of the Beloved, these<br />
distractions produce weariness, and in their swift flight quench<br />
its joy. The Bridegroom adjures them by the soft lyres. That is,<br />
now that the sweetness of the soul is so abundant and so<br />
continuous that they cannot interfere with it, as they did before<br />
when it had not reached this state, He adjures them, and bids them<br />
cease from their disquieting violence. The same explanation is to<br />
be given of the rest of the stanza.</p>
<p>&#8216;Lions, fawns, bounding does.&#8217;</p>
<p>4. By the lions is meant the raging violence of the irascible<br />
faculty, which in its acts is bold and daring as a lion. The<br />
&#8216;fawns and bounding does&#8217; are the concupiscible faculty&#8211;that is,<br />
the power of desire, the qualities of which are two, timidity and<br />
rashness. Timidity betrays itself when things do not turn out<br />
according to our wishes, for then the mind retires within itself<br />
discouraged, and in this respect the soul resembles the fawns. For<br />
as fawns have the concupiscible faculty stronger than many other<br />
animals, so are they more retiring and more timid. Rashness<br />
betrays itself when we have our own way, for the mind is then<br />
neither retiring nor timid, but desires boldly, and gratifies all<br />
its inclinations. This quality of rashness is compared to the<br />
does, who so eagerly seek what they desire that they not only run,<br />
but even leap after it; hence they are described as bounding does.</p>
<p>5. Thus the Bridegroom, in adjuring the lions, restrains the<br />
violence and controls the fury of rage; in adjuring the fawns, He<br />
strengthens the concupiscible faculty against timidity and<br />
irresolution; and in adjuring the does He satisfies and subdues<br />
the desires which were restless before, leaping, like deer, from<br />
one object to another, to satisfy that concupiscence which is now<br />
satisfied by the soft lyres, the sweetness of which it enjoys, and<br />
by the siren strains, in the delight of which it revels.</p>
<p>6. But the Bridegroom does not adjure anger and concupiscence<br />
themselves, because these passions never cease from the soul&#8211;but<br />
their vexations and disorderly acts, signified by the &#8216;lions,<br />
fawns, and bounding does,&#8217; for it is necessary that these<br />
disorderly acts should cease in this state.</p>
<p>&#8216;Mountains, valleys, strands.&#8217;</p>
<p>7. These are the vicious and disorderly actions of the three<br />
faculties of the soul&#8211;memory, understanding, and will. These<br />
actions are disorderly and vicious when they are in extremes, or,<br />
if not in extreme, tending to one extreme or other. Thus the<br />
mountains signify those actions which are vicious in excess,<br />
mountains being high; the valleys, being low, signify those which<br />
are vicious in the extreme of defect. Strands, which are neither<br />
high nor low, but, inasmuch as they are not perfectly level, tend<br />
to one extreme or other, signify those acts of the three powers of<br />
the soul which depart slightly in either direction from the true<br />
mean and equality of justice. These actions, though not disorderly<br />
in the extreme, as they would be if they amounted to mortal sin,<br />
are nevertheless disorderly in part, tending towards venial sin or<br />
imperfection, however slight that tendency may be, in the<br />
understanding, memory, and will. He adjures also all these actions<br />
which depart from the true mean, and bids them cease before the<br />
soft lyres and the siren strains, which so effectually charm the<br />
powers of the soul as to occupy them completely in their true and<br />
proper functions, so that they avoid not only all extremes, but<br />
also the slightest tendency to them.</p>
<p>&#8216;Waters, winds, heat, and the terrors<br />
that keep watch by night.&#8217;</p>
<p>8. These are the affections of the four passions, grief, hope,<br />
joy, and fear. The waters are the affections of grief which<br />
afflict the soul, for they rush into it like water. &#8216;Save me, O<br />
God,&#8217; saith the Psalmist, &#8216;for the waters are come in even unto my<br />
soul.&#8217; [176] The winds are the affections of hope, for they rush<br />
forth like wind, desiring what which is not present but hoped for,<br />
as the Psalmist saith: &#8216;I opened my mouth and drew breath: because<br />
I longed for Thy commandments.&#8217; [177] That is, &#8216;I opened the mouth<br />
of my hope, and drew in the wind of desire, because I hoped and<br />
longed for Thy commandments.&#8217; Heat is the affections of joy which,<br />
like fire, inflame the heart, as it is written: &#8216;My heart waxed<br />
hot within me; and in my meditation a fire shall burn&#8217;; [178] that<br />
is, &#8216;while I meditate I shall have joy.&#8217;</p>
<p>9. The &#8216;terrors that keep watch by night&#8217; are the affections of<br />
fear, which in spiritual persons who have not attained to the<br />
state of spiritual marriage are usually exceedingly strong. They<br />
come sometimes from God when He is going to bestow certain great<br />
graces upon souls, as I said before; [179] He is wont then to fill<br />
the mind with dread, to make the flesh tremble and the senses<br />
numb, because nature is not made strong and perfect and prepared<br />
for these graces. They come also at times from the evil spirit,<br />
who, out of envy and malignity, when he sees a soul sweetly<br />
recollected in God, labours to disturb its tranquillity by<br />
exciting horror and dread, in order to destroy so great a<br />
blessing, and sometimes utters his threats, as it were in the<br />
interior of the soul. But when he finds that he cannot penetrate<br />
within the soul, because it is so recollected, and so united with<br />
God, he strives at least in the province of sense to produce<br />
exterior distractions and inconstancy, sensible pains and horrors,<br />
if perchance he may in this way disturb the soul in the bridal<br />
chamber.</p>
<p>10. These are called terrors of the night, because they are the<br />
work of evil spirits, and because Satan labours, by the help<br />
thereof, to involve the soul in darkness, and to obscure the<br />
divine light wherein it rejoiceth. These terrors are called<br />
watchers, because they awaken the soul and rouse it from its sweet<br />
interior slumber, and also because Satan, their author, is ever on<br />
the watch to produce them. These terrors strike the soul of<br />
persons who are already spiritual, passively, and come either from<br />
God or the evil spirit. I do not refer to temporal or natural<br />
terrors, because spiritual men are not subject to these, as they<br />
are to those of which I am speaking.</p>
<p>11. The Beloved adjures the affections of these four passions,<br />
compels them to cease and to be at rest, because He supplies the<br />
bride now with force, and courage, and satisfaction, by the soft<br />
lyres of His sweetness and the siren strains of His delight, so<br />
that not only they shall not domineer over the soul, but shall not<br />
occasion it any distaste whatever. Such is the grandeur and<br />
stability of the soul in this state, that, although formerly the<br />
waters of grief overwhelmed it, because of its own or other men&#8217;s<br />
sins&#8211;which is what spiritual persons most feel&#8211;the consideration<br />
of them now excites neither pain nor annoyance; even the sensible<br />
feeling of compassion exists not now, though the effects of it<br />
continue in perfection. The weaknesses of its virtues are no<br />
longer in the soul, for they are now constant, strong, and<br />
perfect. As the angels perfectly appreciate all sorrowful things<br />
without the sense of pain, and perform acts of mercy without the<br />
sentiment of pity, so the soul in this transformation of love.<br />
God, however, dispenses sometimes, on certain occasions, with the<br />
soul in this matter, allowing it to feel and suffer, that it may<br />
become more fervent in love, and grow in merit, or for some other<br />
reasons, as He dispensed with His Virgin Mother, St. Paul, and<br />
others. This, however, is not the ordinary condition of this<br />
state.</p>
<p>12. Neither do the desires of hope afflict the soul now, because,<br />
satisfied in its union with God, so far as it is possible in this<br />
life, it has nothing of this world to hope for, and nothing<br />
spiritual to desire, seeing that it feels itself to be full of the<br />
riches of God, though it may grow in charity, and thus, whether<br />
living or dying, it is conformed to the will of God, saying with<br />
the sense and spirit, &#8216;Thy will be done,&#8217; free from the violence<br />
of inclination and desires; and accordingly even its longing for<br />
the beatific vision is without pain.</p>
<p>13. The affections of joy, also, which were wont to move the soul<br />
with more or less vehemence, are not sensibly diminished; neither<br />
does their abundance occasion any surprise. The joy of the soul is<br />
now so abundant that it is like the sea, which is not diminished<br />
by the rivers that flow out of it, nor increased by those that<br />
empty themselves into it; for the soul is now that fountain of<br />
which our Lord said that it is &#8216;springing up into life<br />
everlasting.&#8217; [180]</p>
<p>14. I have said that the soul receives nothing new or unusual in<br />
this state of transformation; it seems to lose all accidental joy,<br />
which is not withheld even from the glorified. That is, accidental<br />
joys and sweetness are indeed no strangers to this soul; yea,<br />
rather, those which it ordinarily has cannot be numbered; yet, for<br />
all this, as to the substantial communication of the spirit, there<br />
is no increase of joy, for that which may occur anew the soul<br />
possesses already, and thus what the soul has already within<br />
itself is greater than anything that comes anew. Hence, then,<br />
whenever any subject of joy and gladness, whether exterior or<br />
spiritually interior, presents itself to the soul, the soul<br />
betakes itself forthwith to rejoicing in the riches it possesses<br />
already within itself, and the joy it has in them is far greater<br />
than any which these new accessions minister, because, in a<br />
certain sense, God is become its possession, Who, though He<br />
delights in all things, yet in nothing so much as in Himself,<br />
seeing that He has all good eminently in Himself. Thus all<br />
accessions of joy serve to remind the soul that its real joy is in<br />
its interior possessions, rather than in these accidental causes,<br />
because, as I have said, the former are greater than the latter.</p>
<p>15. It is very natural for the soul, even when a particular matter<br />
gives it pleasure, that, possessing another of greater worth and<br />
gladness, it should remember it at once and take its pleasure in<br />
it. The accidental character of these spiritual accessions, and<br />
the new impressions they make on the soul, may be said to be as<br />
nothing in comparison with that substantial source which it has<br />
within itself: for the soul which has attained to the perfect<br />
transformation, and is full-grown, grows no more in this state by<br />
means of these spiritual accessions, as those souls do who have<br />
not yet advanced so far. It is a marvellous thing that the soul,<br />
while it receives no accessions of delight, should still seem to<br />
do so and also to have been in possession of them. The reason is<br />
that it is always tasting them anew, because they are ever<br />
renewed; and thus it seems to be continually the recipient of new<br />
accessions, while it has no need of them whatever.</p>
<p>16. But if we speak of that light of glory which in this, the<br />
soul&#8217;s embrace, God sometimes produces within it, and which is a<br />
certain spiritual communion wherein He causes it to behold and<br />
enjoy at the same time the abyss of delight and riches which He<br />
has laid up within it, there is no language to express any degree<br />
of it. As the sun when it shines upon the sea illumines its great<br />
depths, and reveals the pearls, and gold, and precious stones<br />
therein, so the divine sun of the Bridegroom, turning towards the<br />
bride, reveals in a way the riches of her soul, so that even the<br />
angels behold her with amazement and say: &#8216;Who is she that cometh<br />
forth as the morning rising, fair as the moon, bright as the sun,<br />
terrible as the army of a camp set in array.&#8217; [181] This<br />
illumination adds nothing to the grandeur of the soul,<br />
notwithstanding its greatness, because it merely reveals that<br />
which the soul already possessed in order that it might rejoice in<br />
it.</p>
<p>17. Finally, the terrors that keep watch by night do not come nigh<br />
unto her, because of her pureness, courage, and confident trust in<br />
God; the evil spirits cannot shroud her in darkness, nor alarm her<br />
with terrors, nor disturb her with their violent assaults. Thus<br />
nothing can approach her, nothing can molest her, for she has<br />
escaped from all created things and entered in to God, to the<br />
fruition of perfect peace, sweetness, and delight, so far as that<br />
is possible in this life. It is to this state that the words of<br />
Solomon are applicable: &#8216;A secure mind is as it were a continual<br />
feast.&#8217; [182] As in a feast we have the savour of all meat, and<br />
the sweetness of all music, so in this feast, which the bride<br />
keeps in the bosom of her Beloved, the soul rejoices in all<br />
delight, and has the taste of all sweetness. All that I have said,<br />
and all that may be said, on this subject, will always fall short<br />
of that which passeth in the soul which has attained to this<br />
blessed state. For when it shall have attained to the peace of<br />
God, &#8216;which,&#8217; in the words of the Apostle, &#8216;surpasseth all<br />
understanding,&#8217; [183] no description of its state is possible.</p>
<p>&#8216;By the soft lyres and the siren strains I adjure you.&#8217;</p>
<p>18. The soft lyres are the sweetness which the Bridegroom<br />
communicates to the soul in this state, and by which He makes all<br />
its troubles to cease. As the music of lyres fills the soul with<br />
sweetness and delight, carries it rapturously out of itself, so<br />
that it forgets all its weariness and grief, so in like manner<br />
this sweetness so absorbs the soul that nothing painful can reach<br />
it. The Bridegroom says, in substance: &#8216;By that sweetness which I<br />
give thee, let all thy bitterness cease.&#8217; The siren strains are<br />
the ordinary joys of the soul. These are called siren strains<br />
because, as it is said, the music of the sirens is so sweet and<br />
delicious that he who hears it is so rapt and so carried out of<br />
himself that he forgets everything. In the same way the soul is so<br />
absorbed in, and refreshed by, the delight of this union that it<br />
becomes, as it were, charmed against all the vexations and<br />
troubles that may assail it; it is to these the next words of the<br />
stanza refer:</p>
<p>&#8216;Let your fury cease.&#8217;</p>
<p>19. This is the troubles and anxieties which flow from unruly acts<br />
and affections. As anger is a certain violence which disturbs<br />
peace, overlapping its bounds, so also all these affections in<br />
their motions transgress the bounds of the peace and tranquillity<br />
of the soul, disturbing it whenever they touch it. Hence the<br />
Bridegroom says:</p>
<p>&#8216;And touch not the wall.&#8217;</p>
<p>20. The wall is the territory of peace and the fortress of virtue<br />
and perfections, which are the defences and protection of the<br />
soul. The soul is the garden wherein the Beloved feeds among the<br />
flowers, defended and guarded for Him alone. Hence it is called in<br />
the Canticle &#8216;a garden enclosed.&#8217; [184] The Bridegroom bids all<br />
disorderly emotions not to touch the territory and wall of His<br />
garden.</p>
<p>21. &#8216;That the bride may sleep in greater security.&#8217; That is, that<br />
she is delighting herself with more sweetness in the tranquillity<br />
and sweetness she has in the Beloved. That is to say, that now no<br />
door is shut against the soul, and that it is in its power to<br />
abandon itself whenever it wills to this sweet sleep of love,<br />
according to the words of the Bridegroom in the Canticle, &#8216;I<br />
adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes and the harts of<br />
the fields, that you raise not up nor make the beloved to awake<br />
till herself will.&#8217; [185]</p>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>THE Bridegroom was so anxious to rescue His bride from the power<br />
of the flesh and the devil and to set her free, that, having done<br />
so, He rejoices over her like the good shepherd who, having found<br />
the sheep that was lost, laid it upon his shoulders rejoicing;<br />
like the woman who, having found the money she had lost, after<br />
lighting a candle and sweeping the house, called &#8216;together her<br />
friends and neighbours, saying, Rejoice with me.&#8217; [186] So this<br />
loving Shepherd and Bridegroom of souls shows a marvellous joy and<br />
delight when He beholds a soul gained to perfection lying on His<br />
shoulders, and by His hands held fast in the longed-for embrace<br />
and union. He is not alone in His joy, for He makes the angels and<br />
the souls of the blessed partakers of His glory, saying, as in the<br />
Canticle, &#8216;Go forth, ye daughters of Sion, and see king Solomon in<br />
the diadem wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his<br />
betrothal, and in the day of the joy of his heart.&#8217; [187] He calls<br />
the soul His crown, His bride, and the joy of His heart: He<br />
carries it in His arms, and as a bridegroom leads it into His<br />
bridal chamber, as we shall see in the following stanza:</p>
