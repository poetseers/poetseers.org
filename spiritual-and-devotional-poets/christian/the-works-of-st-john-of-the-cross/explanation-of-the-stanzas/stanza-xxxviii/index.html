				<p>There thou wilt show me<br />
That which my soul desired;<br />
And there Thou wilt give at once,<br />
O Thou, my life,<br />
That which Thou gavest me the other day.</p>
<p>THE reason why the soul longed to enter the caverns was that it<br />
might attain to the consummation of the love of God, the object of<br />
its continual desires; that is, that it might love God with the<br />
pureness and perfection wherewith He has loved it, so that it<br />
might thereby requite His love. Hence in the present stanza the<br />
bride saith to the Bridegroom that He will there show her what she<br />
had always aimed at in all her actions, namely, that He would show<br />
her how to love Him perfectly, as He has loved her. And, secondly,<br />
that He will give her that essential glory for which He has<br />
predestined her from the day of His eternity.</p>
<p>&#8216;There Thou wilt show me<br />
That which my soul desired.&#8217;</p>
<p>2. That which the soul aims at is equality in love with God, the<br />
object of its natural and supernatural desire. He who loves cannot<br />
be satisfied if he does not feel that he loves as much as he is<br />
loved. And when the soul sees that in the transformation in God,<br />
such as is possible in this life, notwithstanding the immensity of<br />
its love, it cannot equal the perfection of that love wherewith<br />
God loves it, it desires the clear transformation of glory wherein<br />
it shall equal the perfection of love wherewith it is itself<br />
beloved of God; it desires, I say, the clear transformation of<br />
glory wherein it shall equal His love.</p>
<p>3. For though in this high state, which the soul reaches on earth,<br />
there is a real union of the will, yet it cannot reach that<br />
perfection and strength of love which it will possess in the union<br />
of glory; seeing that then, according to the Apostle, the soul<br />
will know God as it is known of Him: &#8216;Then I shall know even as I<br />
am known.&#8217; [298] That is, &#8216;I shall then love God even as I am<br />
loved by Him.&#8217; For as the understanding of the soul will then be<br />
the understanding of God, and its will the will of God, so its<br />
love will also be His love. Though in heaven the will of the soul<br />
is not destroyed, it is so intimately united with the power of the<br />
will of God, Who loves it, that it loves Him as strongly and as<br />
perfectly as it is loved of Him; both wills being united in one<br />
sole will and one sole love of God.</p>
<p>4. Thus the soul loves God with the will and strength of God<br />
Himself, being made one with that very strength of love wherewith<br />
itself is loved of God. This strength is of the Holy Ghost, in<br />
Whom the soul is there transformed. He is given to the soul to<br />
strengthen its love; ministering to it, and supplying in it,<br />
because of its transformation in glory, that which is defective in<br />
it. In the perfect transformation, also, of the state of spiritual<br />
marriage, such as is possible on earth, in which the soul is all<br />
clothed in grace, the soul loves in a certain way in the Holy<br />
Ghost, Who is given to it in that transformation.</p>
<p>5. We are to observe here that the bride does not say, &#8216;There wilt<br />
Thou give me Thy love,&#8217; though that be true&#8211;for that means only<br />
that God will love her&#8211;but that He will there show her how she is<br />
to love Him with that perfection at which she aims, because there<br />
in giving her His love He will at the same time show her how to<br />
love Him as He loves her. For God not only teaches the soul to<br />
love Himself purely, with a disinterested love, as He hath loved<br />
us, but He also enables it to love Him with that strength with<br />
which He loves the soul, transforming it in His love, wherein He<br />
bestows upon it His own power, so that it may love Him. It is as<br />
if He put an instrument in its hand, taught it the use thereof,<br />
and played upon it together with the soul. This is showing the<br />
soul how it is to love, and at the same time endowing it with the<br />
capacity of loving.</p>
<p>6. The soul is not satisfied until it reaches this point, neither<br />
would it be satisfied even in heaven, unless it felt, as St.<br />
Thomas teaches, [299] that it loved God as much as it is loved of<br />
Him. And as I said of the state of spiritual marriage of which I<br />
am speaking, there is now at this time, though it cannot be that<br />
perfect love in glory, a certain vivid vision and likeness of that<br />
perfection, which is wholly indescribable.</p>
<p>&#8216;And there Thou wilt give me at once, O Thou my life,<br />
that which Thou gavest me the other day.&#8217;</p>
<p>7. What He will give is the essential glory which consists in the<br />
vision of God. Before proceeding further it is requisite to solve<br />
a question which arises here, namely, Why is it, seeing that<br />
essential glory consists in the vision of God, and not in loving<br />
Him, the soul says that its longing is for His love, and not for<br />
the essential glory? Why is it that the soul begins the stanza<br />
with referring to His love, and then introduces the subject of the<br />
essential glory afterwards, as if it were something of less<br />
importance?</p>
<p>8. There are two reasons for this. The first is this: As the whole<br />
aim of the soul is love, the seat of which is in the will, the<br />
property of which is to give and not to receive&#8211;the property of<br />
the understanding, the subject of essential glory, being to<br />
receive and not to give&#8211;to the soul inebriated with love the<br />
first consideration is not the essential glory which God will<br />
bestow upon it, but the entire surrender of itself to Him in true<br />
love, without any regard to its own advantage.</p>
<p>9. The second reason is that the second object is included in the<br />
first, and has been taken for granted in the previous stanzas, it<br />
being impossible to attain to the perfect love of God without the<br />
perfect vision of Him. The question is solved by the first reason,<br />
for the soul renders to God by love that which is His due, but<br />
with the understanding it receives from Him and does not give.</p>
<p>10. I now resume the explanation of the stanza, and inquire what<br />
day is meant by the &#8216;other day,&#8217; and what is it that God then gave<br />
the soul, and what that is which it prays to receive afterwards in<br />
glory? By &#8216;other day&#8217; is meant the day of the eternity of God,<br />
which is other than the day of time. In that day of eternity God<br />
predestined the soul unto glory, and determined the degree of<br />
glory which He would give it and freely gave from the beginning<br />
before He created it. This now, in a manner, so truly belongs to<br />
the soul that no event or accident, high or low, can ever take it<br />
away, for the soul will enjoy for ever that for which God had<br />
predestined it from all eternity.</p>
<p>11. This is that which He gave it &#8216;the other day&#8217;; that which the<br />
soul longs now to possess visibly in glory. And what is that which<br />
He gave it? That what &#8216;eye hath not seen nor ear hath heard,<br />
neither hath it ascended into the heart of man.&#8217; [300] &#8216;The eye<br />
hath not seen,&#8217; saith Isaias, &#8216;O God, beside Thee, what things<br />
Thou hast prepared for them that expect Thee.&#8217; [301] The soul has<br />
no word to describe it, so it says &#8216;what.&#8217; It is in truth the<br />
vision of God, and as there is no expression by which we can<br />
explain what it is to see God, the soul says only &#8216;that which Thou<br />
gavest me.&#8217;</p>
<p>12. But that I may not leave the subject without saying something<br />
further concerning it, I will repeat what Christ hath said of it<br />
in the Apocalypse of St. John, in many terms, phrases, and<br />
comparisons, because a single word once uttered cannot describe<br />
it, for there is much still unsaid, notwithstanding all that<br />
Christ hath spoken at seven different times. &#8216;To him that<br />
overcometh,&#8217; saith He, &#8216;I will give to eat of the tree of life,<br />
which is in the paradise of My God.&#8217; [302] But as this does not<br />
perfectly describe it, He says again: &#8216;Be thou faithful unto<br />
death; and I will give thee the crown of life.&#8217; [303]</p>
<p>13. This also is insufficient, and so He speaks again more<br />
obscurely, but explaining it more: &#8216;To him that overcometh I will<br />
give the hidden manna, and will give him a white counter, and on<br />
the counter a new name written which no man knoweth but he that<br />
receiveth it.&#8217; [304] And as even this is still insufficient, the<br />
Son of God speaks of great power and joy, saying: &#8216;He that shall<br />
overcome and keep My works unto the end, I will give him power<br />
over the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and<br />
as a vessel of the potter they shall be broken: as I also have<br />
received of My Father. And I will give him the morning star.&#8217;<br />
[305] Not satisfied with these words, He adds: &#8216;He that shall<br />
overcome shall thus be vested in white garments, and I will not<br />
put his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name<br />
before My Father.&#8217; [306]</p>
<p>14. Still, all this falls short. He speaks of it in words of<br />
unutterable majesty and grandeur: &#8216;He that shall overcome I will<br />
make Him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall go out no<br />
more; and I will write upon him the name of My God, and the name<br />
of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem which descendeth out of<br />
heaven from My God, and My new name.&#8217; [307] The seventh time He<br />
says: &#8216;He that shall overcome I will give unto him to sit with Me<br />
in My throne: as I also have overcome, and sat with My Father in<br />
His throne. He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith<br />
to the Churches. [308]</p>
<p>15. These are the words of the Son of God; all of which tend to<br />
describe that which was given to the soul. The words correspond<br />
most accurately with it, but still they do not explain it, because<br />
it involves infinite good. The noblest expressions befit it, but<br />
none of them reach it, no, not all together.</p>
<p>16. Let us now see whether David hath said anything of it. In one<br />
of the Psalms he saith, &#8216;O how great is the multitude of thy<br />
sweetness, O Lord, which Thou hast hidden for them that fear<br />
Thee.&#8217; [309] In another place he calls it a &#8216;torrent of pleasure,&#8217;<br />
saying, &#8216;Thou shalt make them drink of the torrent of Thy<br />
pleasure.&#8217; [310] And as he did not consider this enough, he says<br />
again, &#8216;Thou hast prevented him with blessings of sweetness.&#8217;<br />
[311] The expression that rightly fits this &#8216;that&#8217; of the soul,<br />
namely, its predestined bliss, cannot be found. Let us, therefore,<br />
rest satisfied with what the soul has used in reference to it, and<br />
explain the words as follows:</p>
<p>&#8216;That which Thou gavest me.</p>
<p>17. That is, &#8216;That weight of glory to which Thou didst predestine<br />
me, O my Bridegroom, in the day of Thy eternity, when it was Thy<br />
good pleasure to decree my creation, Thou wilt then give me in my<br />
day of my betrothal and of my nuptials, in my day of the joy of my<br />
heart, when, released from the burden of the flesh, led into the<br />
deep caverns of Thy bridal chamber and gloriously transformed in<br />
Thee, we drink the wine of the sweet pomegranates.&#8217;</p>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>BUT inasmuch as the soul, in the state of spiritual marriage, of<br />
which I am now speaking, cannot but know something of this &#8216;that,&#8217;<br />
seeing that because of its transformation in God something of it<br />
must be experienced by it, it will not omit to say something on<br />
the subject, the pledges and signs of which it is conscious of in<br />
itself, as it is written: &#8216;Who can withhold the words He hath<br />
conceived?&#8217; [312] Hence in the following stanza the soul says<br />
something of the fruition which it shall have in the beatific<br />
vision, explaining so far as it is possible the nature and the<br />
manner of it.</p>
