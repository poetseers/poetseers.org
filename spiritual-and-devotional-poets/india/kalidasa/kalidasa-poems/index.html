<h4>The Birth of the War God</h4>
<p>Far in the north Himálaya, lifting high<br />
His towery summits till they cleave the sky,<br />
Spans the wide land from east to western sea,<br />
Lord of the hills, instinct with deity.<br />
For him, when Prithu ruled in days of old<br />
The rich earth, teeming with her gems and gold,<br />
The vassal hills and Meru drained her breast,<br />
To deck Himálaya, for they loved him best;<br />
And earth, the mother, gave her store to fill<br />
With herbs and sparkling ores the royal hill.<br />
Proud mountain-king! his diadem of snow<br />
Dims not the beauty of his gems below.<br />
For who can gaze upon the moon, and dare<br />
To mark one spot less brightly glorious there?[Pg 2]<br />
Who, &#8216;mid a thousand virtues, dares to blame<br />
One shade of weakness in a hero&#8217;s fame?<br />
Oft, when the gleamings of his mountain brass<br />
Flash through the clouds and tint them as they pass,<br />
Those glories mock the hues of closing day,<br />
And heaven&#8217;s bright wantons hail their hour of play;<br />
Try, ere the time, the magic of their glance,<br />
And deck their beauty for the twilight dance.<br />
Dear to the sylphs are the cool shadows thrown<br />
By dark clouds wandering round the mountain&#8217;s zone,<br />
Till frightened by the storm and rain they seek<br />
Eternal sunshine on each loftier peak.<br />
Far spread the wilds where eager hunters roam,<br />
Tracking the lion to his dreary home.<br />
For though the melting snow has washed away<br />
The crimson blood-drops of the wounded prey,<br />
Still the fair pearls that graced his forehead tell<br />
Where the strong elephant, o&#8217;ermastered, fell,<br />
And clinging to the lion&#8217;s claws, betray,<br />
Falling at every step, the mighty conqueror&#8217;s way.<br />
There birch-trees wave, that lend their friendly aid<br />
To tell the passion of the love-lorn maid,<br />
So quick to learn in metal tints to mark<br />
Her hopes and fears upon the tender bark.<br />
List! breathing from each cave, Himálaya leads<br />
The glorious hymn with all his whispering reeds,[Pg 3]<br />
Till heavenly minstrels raise their voice in song,<br />
And swell his music as it floats along.<br />
There the fierce elephant wounds the scented bough<br />
To ease the torment of his burning brow;<br />
And bleeding pines their odorous gum distil<br />
To breathe rare fragrance o&#8217;er the sacred hill.<br />
There magic herbs pour forth their streaming light<br />
From mossy caverns through the darksome night,<br />
And lend a torch to guide the trembling maid<br />
Where waits her lover in the leafy shade.<br />
Yet hath he caves within whose inmost cells<br />
In tranquil rest the murky darkness dwells,<br />
And, like the night-bird, spreads the brooding wing<br />
Safe in the shelter of the mountain-king,<br />
Unscorned, uninjured; for the good and great<br />
Spurn not the suppliant for his lowly state.<br />
Why lingers yet the heavenly minstrel&#8217;s bride<br />
On the wild path that skirts Himálaya&#8217;s side?<br />
Cold to her tender feet—oh, cold—the snow,<br />
Why should her steps—her homeward steps—be slow?<br />
&#8216;Tis that her slender ankles scarce can bear<br />
The weight of beauty that impedes her there;<br />
Each rounded limb, and all her peerless charms,<br />
That broad full bosom, those voluptuous arms.[Pg 4]<br />
E&#8217;en the wild kine that roam his forests bring<br />
The royal symbols to the mountain-king.<br />
With tails outspread, their bushy streaming hair<br />
Flashes like moonlight through the parted air.<br />
What monarch&#8217;s fan more glorious might there be,<br />
More meet to grace a king as proud as he?<br />
There, when the nymphs, within the cave&#8217;s recess,<br />
In modest fear their gentle limbs undress,<br />
Thick clouds descending yield a friendly screen,<br />
And blushing beauty bares her breast unseen.<br />
With pearly dewdrops Gangá loads the gale<br />
That waves the dark pines towering o&#8217;er the vale,<br />
And breathes in welcome freshness o&#8217;er the face<br />
Of wearied hunters when they quit the chase.<br />
So far aloft, amid Himálayan steeps,<br />
Crouched on the tranquil pool the lotus sleeps,<br />
That the bright Seven who star the northern sky<br />
Cull the fair blossoms from their seats on high;<br />
And when the sun pours forth his morning glow<br />
In streams of glory from his path below,<br />
They gain new beauty as his kisses break<br />
His darlings&#8217; slumber on the mountain lake.<br />
Well might that ancient hill by merit claim<br />
The power and glory of a monarch&#8217;s name;[Pg 5]<br />
Nurse of pure herbs that grace each holy rite,<br />
Earth&#8217;s meetest bearer of unyielding might.<br />
The Lord of Life for this ordained him king,<br />
And bade him share the sacred offering.<br />
Gladly obedient to the law divine,<br />
He chose a consort to prolong his line.<br />
No child of earth, born of the Sage&#8217;s will,<br />
The fair nymph Mená pleased the sovran hill.<br />
To her he sued, nor was his prayer denied,<br />
The Saints&#8217; beloved was the mountain&#8217;s bride.<br />
Crowned with all bliss and beauty were the pair,<br />
He passing glorious, she was heavenly fair.<br />
Swiftly the seasons, winged with love, flew on,<br />
And made her mother of a noble son,<br />
The great Maináka, who in triumph led<br />
His Serpent beauties to the bridal bed;<br />
And once when Indra&#8217;s might those pinions rent<br />
That bare the swift hills through the firmament,<br />
(So fierce his rage, no mountain could withstand<br />
The wild bolt flashing from his red right hand,)<br />
He fled to Ocean, powerful to save,<br />
And hid his glory &#8216;neath the friendly wave.<br />
A gentle daughter came at length to bless<br />
The royal mother with her loveliness;<br />
Born once again, for in an earlier life<br />
High fame was hers, as Śiva&#8217;s faithful wife.[Pg 6]<br />
But her proud sire had dared the God to scorn;<br />
Then was her tender soul with anguish torn,<br />
And jealous for the lord she loved so well,<br />
Her angered spirit left its mortal cell.<br />
Now deigned the maid, a lovely boon, to spring<br />
From that pure lady and the mountain-king.<br />
When Industry and Virtue meet and kiss,<br />
Holy their union, and the fruit is bliss.<br />
Blest was that hour, and all the world was gay,<br />
When Mená&#8217;s daughter saw the light of day.<br />
A rosy glow suffused the brightening sky;<br />
An odorous breeze came sweeping softly by.<br />
Breathed round the hill a sweet unearthly strain,<br />
And the glad heavens poured down their flowery rain.<br />
That fair young maiden diademmed with light<br />
Made her dear mother&#8217;s fame more sparkling bright.<br />
As the blue offspring of the Turquois Hills<br />
The parent mount with richer glory fills,<br />
When the cloud&#8217;s voice has caused the gem to spring,<br />
Responsive to its gentle thundering.<br />
Then was it sweet, as days flew by, to trace<br />
The dawning charm of every infant grace,<br />
Even as the crescent moons their glory pour<br />
More full, more lovely than the eve before.<br />
As yet the maiden was unknown to fame;<br />
Child of the Mountain was her only name.[Pg 7]<br />
But when her mother, filled with anxious care<br />
At her stern penance, cried Forbear! Forbear!<br />
To a new title was the warning turned,<br />
And Umá was the name the maiden earned.<br />
Loveliest was she of all his lovely race,<br />
And dearest to her father. On her face<br />
Looking with love he ne&#8217;er could satisfy<br />
The thirsty glances of a parent&#8217;s eye.<br />
When spring-tide bids a thousand flowerets bloom<br />
Loading the breezes with their rich perfume,<br />
Though here and there the wandering bee may rest,<br />
He loves his own—his darling mango—best.<br />
The Gods&#8217; bright river bathes with gold the skies,<br />
And pure sweet eloquence adorns the wise.<br />
The flambeau&#8217;s glory is the shining fire;<br />
She was the pride, the glory of her sire,<br />
Shedding new lustre on his old descent,<br />
His loveliest child, his richest ornament.<br />
The sparkling Gangá laved her heavenly home,<br />
And o&#8217;er her islets would the maiden roam<br />
Amid the dear companions of her play<br />
With ball and doll to while the hours away.<br />
As swans in autumn in assembling bands<br />
Fly back to Gangá&#8217;s well-remembered sands:<br />
As herbs beneath the darksome shades of night<br />
Collect again their scattered rays of light:[Pg 8]<br />
So dawned upon the maiden&#8217;s waking mind<br />
The far-off memory of her life resigned,<br />
And all her former learning in its train,<br />
Feelings, and thoughts, and knowledge came again.<br />
Now beauty&#8217;s prime, that craves no artful aid,<br />
Ripened the loveliness of that young maid:<br />
That needs no wine to fire the captive heart,—<br />
The bow of Love without his flowery dart.<br />
There was a glory beaming from her face,<br />
With love&#8217;s own light, and every youthful grace:<br />
Ne&#8217;er had the painter&#8217;s skilful hand portrayed<br />
A lovelier picture than that gentle maid;<br />
Ne&#8217;er sun-kissed lily more divinely fair<br />
Unclosed her beauty to the morning air.<br />
Bright as a lotus, springing where she trod,<br />
Her glowing feet shed radiance o&#8217;er the sod.<br />
That arching neck, the step, the glance aside,<br />
The proud swans taught her as they stemmed the tide,<br />
Whilst of the maiden they would fondly learn<br />
Her anklets&#8217; pleasant music in return.<br />
When the Almighty Maker first began<br />
The marvellous beauty of that child to plan,<br />
In full fair symmetry each rounded limb<br />
Grew neatly fashioned and approved by Him:<br />
The rest was faultless, for the Artist&#8217;s care<br />
Formed each young charm most excellently fair,[Pg 9]<br />
As if his moulding hand would fain express<br />
The visible type of perfect loveliness.<br />
What thing of beauty may the poet dare<br />
With the smooth wonder of those limbs compare?<br />
The young tree springing by the brooklet&#8217;s side?<br />
The rounded trunk, the forest-monarch&#8217;s pride?<br />
Too rough that trunk, too cold that young tree&#8217;s stem;<br />
A softer, warmer thing must vie with them.<br />
Her hidden beauties though no tongue may tell,<br />
Yet Śiva&#8217;s love will aid the fancy well:<br />
No other maid could deem her boasted charms<br />
Worthy the clasp of such a husband&#8217;s arms.<br />
Between the partings of fair Umá&#8217;s vest<br />
Came hasty glimpses of a lovely breast:<br />
So closely there the sweet twin hillocks rose,<br />
Scarce could the lotus in the vale repose.<br />
And if her loosened zone e&#8217;er slipped below,<br />
All was so bright beneath the mantle&#8217;s flow,<br />
So dazzling bright, as if the maid had braced<br />
A band of gems to sparkle round her waist;<br />
And the dear dimples of her downy skin<br />
Seemed fitting couch for Love to revel in.<br />
Her arms were softer than the flowery dart,<br />
Young Káma&#8217;s arrow, that subdues the heart;<br />
For vain his strife with Śiva, till at last<br />
He chose those chains to bind his conqueror fast.[Pg 10]<br />
E&#8217;en the new moon poured down a paler beam<br />
When her long fingers flashed their rosy gleam,<br />
And brighter than Aśoka&#8217;s blossom threw<br />
A glory round, like summer&#8217;s evening hue.<br />
The strings of pearl across her bosom thrown<br />
Increased its beauty, and enhanced their own,—<br />
Her breast, her jewels seeming to agree,<br />
The adorner now, and now the adorned to be.<br />
When Beauty gazes on the fair full moon,<br />
No lotus charms her, for it blooms at noon:<br />
If on that flower she feed her raptured eye,<br />
No moon is shining from the mid-day sky;<br />
She looked on Umá&#8217;s face, more heavenly fair,<br />
And found their glories both united there.<br />
The loveliest flower that ever opened yet<br />
Laid in the fairest branch: a fair pearl set<br />
In richest coral, with her smile might vie<br />
Flashing through lips bright with their rosy dye.<br />
And when she spoke, upon the maiden&#8217;s tongue,<br />
Distilling nectar, such rare accents hung,<br />
The sweetest note that e&#8217;er the Koïl poured<br />
Seemed harsh and tuneless as a jarring chord.<br />
The melting glance of that soft liquid eye,<br />
Tremulous like lilies when the breezes sigh,<br />
Which learnt it first—so winning and so mild—<br />
The gentle fawn, or Mená&#8217;s gentler child?[Pg 11]<br />
And oh, the arching of her brow! so fine<br />
Was the rare beauty of its pencilled line,<br />
Love gazed upon her forehead in despair<br />
And spurned the bow he once esteemed so fair:<br />
Her long bright tresses too might shame the pride<br />
Of envious yaks who roamed the mountain-side.<br />
Surely the Maker&#8217;s care had been to bring<br />
From Nature&#8217;s store each sweetest, loveliest thing,<br />
As if the world&#8217;s Creator would behold<br />
All beauty centred in a single mould.<br />
When holy Nárad—Saint who roams at will—<br />
First saw the daughter of the royal hill,<br />
He hailed the bride whom Śiva&#8217;s love should own<br />
Half of himself, and partner of his throne.<br />
Himálaya listened, and the father&#8217;s pride<br />
Would yield the maiden for no other&#8217;s bride:<br />
To Fire alone of all bright things we raise<br />
The holy hymn, the sacrifice of praise.<br />
But still the monarch durst not, could not bring<br />
His child, unsought, to Heaven&#8217;s supremest King;<br />
But as a good man fears his earnest prayer<br />
Should rise unheeded, and with thoughtful care<br />
Seeks for some friend his eager suit to aid,<br />
Thus great Himálaya in his awe delayed.[Pg 12]<br />
Since the sad moment when his gentle bride<br />
In the full glory of her beauty died,<br />
The mournful Śiva in the holy grove<br />
Had dwelt in solitude, and known not love.<br />
High on that hill where musky breezes throw<br />
Their balmy odours o&#8217;er eternal snow;<br />
Where heavenly minstrels pour their notes divine,<br />
And rippling Gangá laves the mountain pine,<br />
Clad in a coat of skin all rudely wrought<br />
He lived for prayer and solitary thought.<br />
The faithful band that served the hermit&#8217;s will<br />
Lay in the hollows of the rocky hill,<br />
Where from the clefts the dark bitumen flowed.<br />
Tinted with mineral dyes their bodies glowed;<br />
Clad in rude mantles of the birch-tree&#8217;s rind,<br />
With bright red garlands was their hair entwined.<br />
The holy bull before his master&#8217;s feet<br />
Shook the hard-frozen earth with echoing feet,<br />
And as he heard the lion&#8217;s roaring swell<br />
In distant thunder from the rocky dell,<br />
In angry pride he raised his voice of fear<br />
And from the mountain drove the startled deer.<br />
Bright fire—a shape the God would sometimes wear<br />
Who takes eight various forms—was glowing there.<br />
Then the great deity who gives the prize<br />
Of penance, prayer, and holy exercise,[Pg 13]<br />
As though to earn the meed he grants to man,<br />
Himself the penance and the pain began.<br />
Now to that holy lord, to whom is given<br />
Honour and glory by the Gods in heaven,<br />
The worship of a gift Himálaya paid,<br />
And towards his dwelling sent the lovely maid;<br />
Her task, attended by her youthful train,<br />
To woo his widowed heart to love again.<br />
The hermit welcomed with a courteous brow<br />
That gentle enemy of hermit vow.<br />
The still pure breast where Contemplation dwells<br />
Defies the charmer and the charmer&#8217;s spells.<br />
Calm and unmoved he viewed the wondrous maid,<br />
And bade her all his pious duties aid.<br />
She culled fresh blossoms at the God&#8217;s command,<br />
Sweeping the altar with a careful hand;<br />
The holy grass for sacred rites she sought,<br />
And day by day the fairest water brought.<br />
And if the unwonted labour caused a sigh,<br />
The fair-haired lady turned her languid eye<br />
Where the pale moon on Śiva&#8217;s forehead gleamed,<br />
And swift through all her frame returning vigour streamed.</p>
