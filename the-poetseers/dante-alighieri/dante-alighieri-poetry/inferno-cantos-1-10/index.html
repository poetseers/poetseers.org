				<p>CANTO I</p>
<p>One night, when half my life behind me lay, <br />
I wandered from the straight lost path afar. <br />
Through the great dark was no releasing way; <br />
Above that dark was no relieving star. <br />
If yet that terrored night I think or say, <br />
As death&#8217;s cold hands its fears resuming are.</p>
<p>Gladly the dreads I felt, too dire to tell, <br />
The hopeless, pathless, lightless hours forgot, <br />
I turn my tale to that which next befell, <br />
When the dawn opened, and the night was not. <br />
The hollowed blackness of that waste, God wot, <br />
Shrank, thinned, and ceased. A blinding splendour hot <br />
Flushed the great height toward which my footsteps fell, <br />
And though it kindled from the nether hell, <br />
Or from the Star that all men leads, alike <br />
It showed me where the great dawn-glories strike <br />
The wide east, and the utmost peaks of snow.</p>
<p>How first I entered on that path astray, <br />
Beset with sleep, I know not. This I know. <br />
When gained my feet the upward, lighted way, <br />
I backward gazed, as one the drowning sea, <br />
The deep strong tides, has baffled, and panting lies, <br />
On the shelved shore, and turns his eyes to see <br />
The league-wide wastes that held him. So mine eyes <br />
Surveyed that fear, the while my wearied frame <br />
Rested, and ever my heart&#8217;s tossed lake became <br />
More quiet. <br />
Then from that pass released, which yet <br />
With living feet had no man left, I set <br />
My forward steps aslant the steep, that so, <br />
My right foot still the lower, I climbed. <br />
Below <br />
No more I gazed. Around, a slope of sand <br />
Was sterile of all growth on either hand, <br />
Or moving life, a spotted pard except, <br />
That yawning rose, and stretched, and purred and leapt <br />
So closely round my feet, that scarce I kept <br />
The course I would. <br />
That sleek and lovely thing, <br />
The broadening light, the breath of morn and spring, <br />
The sun, that with his stars in Aries lay, <br />
As when Divine Love on Creation&#8217;s day <br />
First gave these fair things motion, all at one <br />
Made lightsome hope; but lightsome hope was none <br />
When down the slope there came with lifted head <br />
And back-blown mane and caverned mouth and red, <br />
A lion, roaring, all the air ashake <br />
That heard his hunger. Upward flight to take <br />
No heart was mine, for where the further way <br />
Mine anxious eyes explored, a she-wolf lay, <br />
That licked lean flanks, and waited. Such was she <br />
In aspect ruthless that I quaked to see, <br />
And where she lay among her bones had brought <br />
So many to grief before, that all my thought <br />
Aghast turned backward to the sunless night <br />
I left. But while I plunged in headlong flight <br />
To that most feared before, a shade, or man <br />
(Either he seemed), obstructing where I ran, <br />
Called to me with a voice that few should know, <br />
Faint from forgetful silence, &#8220;Where ye go, <br />
Take heed. Why turn ye from the upward way?&#8221;</p>
<p>I cried, &#8220;Or come ye from warm earth, or they <br />
The grave hath taken, in my mortal need <br />
Have mercy thou!&#8221; <br />
He answered, &#8220;Shade am I, <br />
That once was man; beneath the Lombard sky, <br />
In the late years of Julius born, and bred <br />
In Mantua, till my youthful steps were led <br />
To Rome, where yet the false gods lied to man; <br />
And when the great Augustan age began, <br />
I wrote the tale of Ilium burnt, and how <br />
Anchises&#8217; son forth-pushed a venturous prow, <br />
Seeking unknown seas. But in what mood art thou <br />
To thus return to all the ills ye fled, <br />
The while the mountain of thy hope ahead <br />
Lifts into light, the source and cause of all <br />
Delectable things that may to man befall?&#8221;</p>
<p>I answered, &#8220;Art thou then that Virgil, he <br />
From whom all grace of measured speech in me <br />
Derived? O glorious and far-guiding star! <br />
Now may the love-led studious hours and long <br />
In which I learnt how rich thy wonders are, <br />
Master and Author mine of Light and Song, <br />
Befriend me now, who knew thy voice, that few <br />
Yet hearken. All the name my work hath won <br />
Is thine of right, from whom I learned. To thee, <br />
Abashed, I grant it. . . Why the mounting sun <br />
No more I seek, ye scarce should ask, who see <br />
The beast that turned me, nor faint hope have I <br />
To force that passage if thine aid deny.&#8221; <br />
He answered, &#8220;Would ye leave this wild and live, <br />
Strange road is ours, for where the she-wolf lies <br />
Shall no man pass, except the path he tries <br />
Her craft entangle. No way fugitive <br />
Avoids the seeking of her greeds, that give <br />
Insatiate hunger, and such vice perverse <br />
As makes her leaner while she feeds, and worse <br />
Her craving. And the beasts with which she breed <br />
The noisome numerous beasts her lusts require, <br />
Bare all the desirable lands in which she feeds; <br />
Nor shall lewd feasts and lewder matings tire <br />
Until she woos, in evil hour for her, <br />
The wolfhound that shall rend her. His desire <br />
Is not for rapine, as the promptings stir <br />
Of her base heart; but wisdoms, and devoirs <br />
Of manhood, and love&#8217;s rule, his thoughts prefer. <br />
The Italian lowlands he shall reach and save, <br />
For which Camilla of old, the virgin brave, <br />
Turnus and Nisus died in strife. His chase <br />
He shall not cease, nor any cowering-place <br />
Her fear shall find her, till he drive her back, <br />
From city to city exiled, from wrack to wrack <br />
Slain out of life, to find the native hell <br />
Whence envy loosed her. <br />
For thyself were well <br />
To follow where I lead, and thou shalt see <br />
The spirits in pain, and hear the hopeless woe, <br />
The unending cries, of those whose only plea <br />
Is judgment, that the second death to be <br />
Fall quickly. Further shalt thou climb, and go <br />
To those who burn, but in their pain content <br />
With hope of pardon; still beyond, more high, <br />
Holier than opens to such souls as I, <br />
The Heavens uprear; but if thou wilt, is one <br />
Worthier, and she shall guide thee there, where none <br />
Who did the Lord of those fair realms deny <br />
May enter. There in his city He dwells, and there <br />
Rules and pervades in every part, and calls <br />
His chosen ever within the sacred walls. <br />
O happiest, they!&#8221; <br />
I answered, &#8220;By that Go <br />
Thou didst not know, I do thine aid entreat, <br />
And guidance, that beyond the ills I meet <br />
I safety find, within the Sacred Gate <br />
That Peter guards, and those sad souls to see <br />
Who look with longing for their end to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he moved forward, and behind I trod.</p>
<p>
Canto II</p>
<p>
THE day was falling, and the darkening air <br />
Released earth&#8217;s creatures from their toils, while I, <br />
I only, faced the bitter road and bare <br />
My Master led. I only, must defy <br />
The powers of pity, and the night to be. <br />
So thought I, but the things I came to see, <br />
Which memory holds, could never thought forecast. <br />
O Muses high! O Genius, first and last! <br />
Memories intense! Your utmost powers combine <br />
To meet this need. For never theme as mine <br />
Strained vainly, where your loftiest nobleness <br />
Must fail to be sufficient. <br />
First I said, <br />
Fearing, to him who through the darkness led, <br />
&#8220;O poet, ere the arduous path ye press <br />
Too far, look in me, if the worth there be <br />
To make this transit. &amp;AELIG;neas once, I know, <br />
Went down in life, and crossed the infernal sea; <br />
And if the Lord of All Things Lost Below <br />
Allowed it, reason seems, to those who see <br />
The enduring greatness of his destiny, <br />
Who in the Empyrean Heaven elect was called <br />
Sire of the Eternal City, that throned and walled <br />
Made Empire of the world beyond, to be <br />
The Holy Place at last, by God&#8217;s decree, <br />
Where the great Peter&#8217;s follower rules. For he <br />
Learned there the causes of his victory.</p>
<p>&#8220;And later to the third great Heaven was caught <br />
The last Apostle, and thence returning brought <br />
The proofs of our salvation. But, for me, <br />
I am not &amp;AELIG;neas, nay, nor Paul, to see <br />
Unspeakable things that depths or heights can show, <br />
And if this road for no sure end I go <br />
What folly is mine? But any words are weak. <br />
Thy wisdom further than the things I speak <br />
Can search the event that would be.&#8221; <br />
Here I stayed <br />
My steps amid the darkness, and the Shade <br />
That led me heard and turned, magnanimous, <br />
And saw me drained of purpose halting thus, <br />
And answered, &#8220;If thy coward-born thoughts be clear, <br />
And all thy once intent, infirmed of fear, <br />
Broken, then art thou as scared beasts that shy <br />
From shadows, surely that they know not why <br />
Nor wherefore. . . Hearken, to confound thy fear, <br />
The things which first I heard, and brought me here. <br />
One came where, in the Outer Place, I dwell, <br />
Suspense from hope of Heaven or fear of Hell, <br />
Radiant in light that native round her clung, <br />
And cast her eyes our hopeless Shades among <br />
(Eyes with no earthly like but heaven&#8217;s own blue), <br />
And called me to her in such voice as few <br />
In that grim place had heard, so low, so clear, <br />
So toned and cadenced from the Utmost Sphere, <br />
The Unattainable Heaven from which she came. <br />
&#8216;O Mantuan Spirit,&#8217; she said, &#8216;whose lasting fame <br />
Continues on the earth ye left, and still <br />
With Time shall stand, an earthly friend to me, <br />
- My friend, not fortune&#8217;s &#8211; climbs a path so ill <br />
That all the night-bred fears he hastes to flee <br />
Were kindly to the thing he nears. The tale <br />
Moved through the peace of I leaven, and swift I sped <br />
Downward, to aid my friend in love&#8217;s avail, <br />
With scanty time therefor, that half I dread <br />
Too late I came. But thou shalt haste, and go <br />
With golden wisdom of thy speech, that so <br />
For me be consolation. Thou shalt say, <br />
&#8220;I come from Beatric&euml;.&#8221; Downward far, <br />
From Heaven to I leaven I sank, from star to star, <br />
To find thee, and to point his rescuing way. <br />
Fain would I to my place of light return; <br />
Love moved me from it, and gave me power to learn <br />
Thy speech. When next before my Lord I stand <br />
I very oft shall praise thee.&#8217; <br />
Here she ceased, <br />
And I gave answer to that dear command, <br />
&#8216;Lady, alone through whom the whole race of those <br />
The smallest Heaven the moon&#8217;s short orbits hold <br />
Excels in its creation, not thy least, <br />
Thy lightest wish in this dark realm were told <br />
Vainly. But show me why the Heavens unclose <br />
To loose thee from them, and thyself content <br />
Couldst thus continue in such strange descent <br />
From that most Spacious Place for which ye burn, <br />
And while ye further left, would fain return.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8216;That which thou wouldst,&#8217; she said, &#8216;I briefly tell. <br />
There is no fear nor any hurt in Hell, <br />
Except that it be powerful. God in me <br />
Is gracious, that the piteous sights I see <br />
I share not, nor myself can shrink to feel <br />
The flame of all this burning. One there is <br />
In height among the Holiest placed, and she <br />
- Mercy her name &#8211; among God&#8217;s mysteries <br />
Dwells in the midst, and hath the power to see <br />
His judgments, and to break them. This sharp <br />
I tell thee, when she saw, she called, that so <br />
Leaned Lucia toward her while she spake &#8211; and said, <br />
&#8220;One that is faithful to thy name is sped, <br />
Except that now ye aid him.&#8221; She thereat, <br />
- Lucia, to all men&#8217;s wrongs inimical &#8211; <br />
Left her High Place, and crossed to where I sat <br />
In speech with Rachel (of the first of all <br />
God saved). &#8220;O Beatrice, Praise of God,&#8221; <br />
- So said she to me &#8211; &#8220;sitt&#8217;st thou here so slow <br />
To aid him, once on earth that loved thee so <br />
That all he left to serve thee? Hear&#8217;st thou not <br />
The anguish of his plaint? and dost not see, <br />
By that dark stream that never seeks a sea, <br />
The death that threats him?&#8221; <br />
None, as thus she said, <br />
None ever was swift on earth his good to chase, <br />
None ever on earth was swift to leave his dread, <br />
As came I downward from that sacred place <br />
To find thee and invoke thee, confident <br />
Not vainly for his need the gold were spent <br />
Of thy word-wisdom.&#8217; Here she turned away, <br />
Her bright eyes clouded with their tears, and I, <br />
Who saw them, therefore made more haste to reach <br />
The place she told, and found thee. Canst thou say <br />
I failed thy rescue? Is the beast anigh <br />
From which ye quailed? When such dear saints beseech <br />
- Three from the Highest &#8211; that Heaven thy course allow <br />
Why halt ye fearful? In such guards as thou <br />
The faintest-hearted might be bold.&#8221; <br />
As flowers, <br />
Close-folded through the cold and lightless hours, <br />
Their bended stems erect, and opening fair <br />
Accept the white light and the warmer air <br />
Of morning, so my fainting heart anew <br />
Lifted, that heard his comfort. Swift I spake, <br />
&#8220;O courteous thou, and she compassionate! <br />
Thy haste that saved me, and her warning true, <br />
Beyond my worth exalt me. Thine I make <br />
My will. In concord of one mind from now, <br />
O Master and my Guide, where leadest thou <br />
I follow.&#8221; <br />
And we, with no more words&#8217; delay, <br />
Went forward on that hard and dreadful way.</p>
<p>
Canto III</p>
<p>THE gateway to the city of Doom. Through me <br />
The entrance to the Everlasting Pain. <br />
The Gateway of the Lost. The Eternal Three <br />
Justice impelled to build me. Here ye see <br />
Wisdom Supreme at work, and Primal Power, <br />
And Love Supernal in their dawnless day. <br />
Ere from their thought creation rose in flower <br />
Eternal first were all things fixed as they. <br />
Of Increate Power infinite formed am I <br />
That deathless as themselves I do not die. <br />
Justice divine has weighed: the doom is clear. <br />
All hope renounce, ye lost, who enter here. <br />
This scroll in gloom above the gate I read, <br />
And found it fearful. &#8220;Master, hard,&#8221; I said, <br />
&#8220;This saying to me.&#8221; And he, as one that long <br />
Was customed, answered, &#8220;No distrust must wrong <br />
Its Maker, nor thy cowarder mood resume <br />
If here ye enter. This the place of doom <br />
I told thee, where the lost in darkness dwell. <br />
Here, by themselves divorced from light, they fell, <br />
And are as ye shall see them.&#8221; Here he lent <br />
A hand to draw me through the gate, and bent <br />
A glance upon my fear so confident <br />
That I, too nearly to my former dread <br />
Returned, through all my heart was comforted, <br />
And downward to the secret things we went.</p>
<p>Downward to night, but not of moon and cloud, <br />
Not night with all its stars, as night we know, <br />
But burdened with an ocean-weight of woe <br />
The darkness closed us. <br />
Sighs, and wailings loud, <br />
Outcries perpetual of recruited pain, <br />
Sounds of strange tongues, and angers that remain <br />
Vengeless for ever, the thick and clamorous crowd <br />
Of discords pressed, that needs I wept to hear, <br />
First hearing. There, with reach of hands anear, <br />
And voices passion-hoarse, or shrilled with fright, <br />
The tumult of the everlasting night, <br />
As sand that dances in continual wind, <br />
Turns on itself for ever. <br />
And I, my head <br />
Begirt with movements, and my ears bedinned <br />
With outcries round me, to my leader said, <br />
&#8220;Master, what hear I? Who so overborne <br />
With woes are these?&#8221; <br />
He answered, &#8220;These be they <br />
That praiseless lived and blameless. Now the scorn <br />
Of Height and Depth alike, abortions drear; <br />
Cast with those abject angels whose delay <br />
To join rebellion, or their Lord defend, <br />
Waiting their proved advantage, flung them here. &#8211; <br />
Chased forth from Heaven, lest else its beauties end <br />
The pure perfection of their stainless claim, <br />
Out-herded from the shining gate they came, <br />
Where the deep hells refused them, lest the lost <br />
Boast something baser than themselves.&#8221; <br />
And I, <br />
&#8220;Master, what grievance hath their failure cost, <br />
That through the lamentable dark they cry?&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered, &#8220;Briefly at a thing not worth <br />
We glance, and pass forgetful. Hope in death <br />
They have not. Memory of them on the earth <br />
Where once they lived remains not. Nor the breath <br />
Of Justice shall condemn, nor Mercy plead, <br />
But all alike disdain them. That they know <br />
Themselves so mean beneath aught else constrains <br />
The envious outcries that too long ye heed. <br />
Move past, but speak not.&#8221; <br />
Then I looked, and lo, <br />
Were souls in ceaseless and unnumbered trains <br />
That past me whirled unending, vainly led <br />
Nowhither, in useless and unpausing haste. <br />
A fluttering ensign all their guide, they chased <br />
Themselves for ever. I had not thought the dead, <br />
The whole world&#8217;s dead, so many as these. I saw <br />
The shadow of him elect to Peter&#8217;s seat <br />
Who made the great refusal, and the law, <br />
The unswerving law that left them this retreat <br />
To seal the abortion of their lives, became <br />
Illumined to me, and themselves I knew, <br />
To God and all his foes the futile crew <br />
How hateful in their everlasting shame.</p>
<p>I saw these victims of continued death <br />
- For lived they never &#8211; were naked all, and loud <br />
Around them closed a never-ceasing cloud <br />
Of hornets and great wasps, that buzzed and clung, <br />
- Weak pain for weaklings meet, &#8211; and where they stung, <br />
Blood from their faces streamed, with sobbing breath, <br />
And all the ground beneath with tears and blood <br />
Was drenched, and crawling in that loathsome mud <br />
There were great worms that drank it. <br />
Gladly thence <br />
I gazed far forward. Dark and wide the flood <br />
That flowed before us. On the nearer shore <br />
Were people waiting. &#8220;Master, show me whence <br />
These came, and who they be, and passing hence <br />
Where go they? Wherefore wait they there content, <br />
- The faint light shows it, &#8211; for their transit o&#8217;er <br />
The unbridged abyss?&#8221; <br />
He answered, &#8220;When we stand <br />
Together, waiting on the joyless strand, <br />
In all it shall be told thee.&#8221; If he meant <br />
Reproof I know not, but with shame I bent <br />
My downward eyes, and no more spake until <br />
The bank we reached, and on the stream beheld <br />
A bark ply toward us. <br />
Of exceeding eld, <br />
And hoary showed the steersman, screaming shrill, <br />
With horrid glee the while he neared us, &#8220;Woe <br />
To ye, depraved! &#8211; Is here no Heaven, but ill <br />
The place where I shall herd ye. Ice and fire <br />
And darkness are the wages of their hire <br />
Who serve unceasing here &#8211; But thou that there <br />
Dost wait though live, depart ye. Yea, forbear! <br />
A different passage and a lighter fare <br />
Is destined thine.&#8221; <br />
But here my guide replied, <br />
&#8220;Nay, Charon, cease; or to thy grief ye chide. <br />
It There is willed, where that is willed shall be, <br />
That ye shall pass him to the further side, <br />
Nor question more.&#8221; <br />
The fleecy cheeks thereat, <br />
Blown with fierce speech before, were drawn and flat, <br />
And his flame-circled eyes subdued, to hear <br />
That mandate given. But those of whom he spake <br />
In bitter glee, with naked limbs ashake, <br />
And chattering teeth received it. Seemed that then <br />
They first were conscious where they came, and fear <br />
Abject and frightful shook them; curses burst <br />
In clamorous discords forth; the race of men, <br />
Their parents, and their God, the place, the time, <br />
Of their conceptions and their births, accursed <br />
Alike they called, blaspheming Heaven. But yet <br />
Slow steps toward the waiting bark they set, <br />
With terrible wailing while they moved. And so <br />
They came reluctant to the shore of woe <br />
That waits for all who fear not God, and not <br />
Them only. <br />
Then the demon Charon rose <br />
To herd them in, with eyes that furnace-hot <br />
Glowed at the task, and lifted oar to smite <br />
Who lingered. <br />
As the leaves, when autumn shows, <br />
One after one descending, leave the bough, <br />
Or doves come downward to the call, so now <br />
The evil seed of Adam to endless night, <br />
As Charon signalled, from the shore&#8217;s bleak height, <br />
Cast themselves downward to the bark. The brown <br />
And bitter flood received them, and while they passed <br />
Were others gathering, patient as the last, <br />
Not conscious of their nearing doom. <br />
&#8220;My son,&#8221; <br />
- Replied my guide the unspoken thought &#8211; &#8220;is none <br />
Beneath God&#8217;s wrath who dies in field or town, <br />
Or earth&#8217;s wide space, or whom the waters drown, <br />
But here he cometh at last, and that so spurred <br />
By Justice, that his fear, as those ye heard, <br />
Impels him forward like desire. Is not <br />
One spirit of all to reach the fatal spot <br />
That God&#8217;s love holdeth, and hence, if Char <br />
chide, <br />
Ye well may take it. &#8211; Raise thy heart, for now, <br />
Constrained of Heaven, he must thy course allow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet how I passed I know not. For the ground <br />
Trembled that heard him, and a fearful sound <br />
Of issuing wind arose, and blood-red light <br />
Broke from beneath our feet, and sense and sight <br />
Left me. The memory with cold sweat once more <br />
Reminds me of the sudden-crimsoned night, <br />
As sank I senseless by the dreadful shore.</p>
<p>
Canto IV</p>
<p>
ARISING thunder from the vast Abyss <br />
First roused me, not as he that rested wakes <br />
From slumbrous hours, but one rude fury shakes <br />
Untimely, and around I gazed to know <br />
The place of my confining. <br />
Deep, profound, <br />
Dark beyond sight, and choked with doleful sound, <br />
Sheer sank the Valley of the Lost Abyss, <br />
Beneath us. On the utmost brink we stood, <br />
And like the winds of some unresting wood <br />
The gathered murmur from those depths of woe <br />
Soughed upward into thunder. Out from this <br />
The unceasing sound comes ever. I might not tell <br />
How deep the Abyss down sank from hell to hell, <br />
It was so clouded and so dark no sight <br />
Could pierce it. <br />
&#8220;Downward through the worlds of night <br />
We will descend together. I first, and thou <br />
My footsteps taking,&#8221; spake my guide, and I <br />
Gave answer, &#8220;Master, when thyself art pale, <br />
Fear-daunted, shall my weaker heart avail <br />
That on thy strength was rested?&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Nay,&#8221; said he, <br />
&#8220;Not fear, but anguish at the issuing cry <br />
So pales me. Come ye, for the path we tread <br />
Is long, and time requires it.&#8221; Here he led <br />
Through the first entrance of the ringed abyss, <br />
Inward, and I went after, and the woe <br />
Softened behind us, and around I heard <br />
Nor scream of torment, nor blaspheming word, <br />
But round us sighs so many and deep there came <br />
That all the air was motioned. I beheld <br />
Concourse of men and women and children there <br />
Countless. No pain was theirs of cold or flame, <br />
But sadness only. And my Master said, <br />
&#8220;Art silent here? Before ye further go <br />
Among them wondering, it is meet ye know <br />
They are not sinful, nor the depths below <br />
Shall claim them. But their lives of righteousness <br />
Sufficed not to redeem. The gate decreed, <br />
Being born too soon, we did not pass ( for I, <br />
Dying unbaptized, am of them). More nor less <br />
Our doom is weighed, &#8211; to feel of Heaven the need, <br />
To long, and to be hopeless.&#8221; <br />
Grief was mine <br />
That heard him, thinking what great names must be <br />
In this suspense around me. &#8220;Master, tell,&#8221; <br />
I questioned, &#8220;from this outer girth of Hell <br />
Pass any to the blessed spheres exalt, <br />
Through other&#8217;s merits or their own the fault. <br />
Condoned?&#8221; And he, my covert speech that read, <br />
- For surance sought I of my faith, &#8211; replied, <br />
&#8220;Through the shrunk hells there came a Great One, crowned <br />
And garmented with conquest. Of the dead, <br />
He rescued from us him who earliest died, <br />
Abel, and our first parent. Here He found, <br />
Abraham, obedient to the Voice he heard; <br />
And Moses, first who wrote the Sacred Word; <br />
Isaac, and Israel and his sons, and she, <br />
Rachel, for whom he travailed; and David, king; <br />
And many beside unnumbered, whom he led <br />
Triumphant from the dark abodes, to be <br />
Among the blest for ever. Until this thing <br />
I witnessed, none, of all the countless dead, <br />
But hopeless through the somber gate he came.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now while he spake he paused not, but pursued, <br />
Through the dense woods of thronging spirits, his aim <br />
Straight onward, nor was long our path until <br />
Before us rose a widening light, to fill <br />
One half of all the darkness, and I knew <br />
While yet some distance, that such Shades were there <br />
As nobler moved than others, and questioned, &#8220;Who, <br />
Master, are those that in their aspect bear <br />
Such difference from the rest?&#8221; <br />
&#8220;All these,&#8221; he said, <br />
&#8220;Were named so glorious in thy earth above <br />
That Heaven allows their larger claim to be <br />
Select, as thus ye see them.&#8221; <br />
While he spake <br />
A voice rose near us: &#8220;Hail!&#8221; it cried, &#8220;for he <br />
Returns, who was departed.&#8221; <br />
Scarce it ceased <br />
When four great spirits approached. They did not show <br />
Sadness nor joy, but tranquil-eyed as though <br />
Content in their dominion moved. My guide <br />
Before I questioned told, &#8220;That first ye see, <br />
With hand that fits the swordhilt, mark, for he <br />
Is Homer, sovereign of the craft we tried, <br />
Leader and lord of even the following three, &#8211; <br />
Horace, and Ovid, and Lucan. The voice ye heard, <br />
That hailed me, caused them by one impulse stirred <br />
Approach to do me honour, for these agree <br />
In that one name we boast, and so do well <br />
Owning it in me.&#8221; There was I joyed to meet <br />
Those shades, who closest to his place belong, <br />
The eagle course of whose out-soaring song <br />
Is lonely in height. <br />
Some space apart (to tell, <br />
It may be, something of myself ), my guide <br />
Conversed, until they turned with grace to greet <br />
Me also, and my Master smiled to see <br />
They made me sixth and equal. Side by side <br />
We paced toward the widening light, and spake <br />
Such things as well were spoken there, and here <br />
Were something less than silence. <br />
Strong and wide <br />
Before us rose a castled height, beset <br />
With sevenfold-circling walls, unscalable, <br />
And girdled with a rivulet round, but yet <br />
We passed thereover, and the water clear <br />
As dry land bore me; and the walls ahead <br />
Their seven strong gates made open one by one, <br />
As each we neared, that where my Master led <br />
With ease I followed, although without were none <br />
But deep that stream beyond their wading spread, <br />
And closed those gates beyond their breach had been, <br />
Had they sought entry with us. <br />
Of coolest green <br />
Stretched the wide lawns we midmost found, for there, <br />
Intolerant of itself, was Hell made fair <br />
To accord with its containing. <br />
Grave, austere, <br />
Quiet-voiced and slow, of seldom words were they <br />
That walked that verdure. <br />
To a place aside <br />
Open, and light, and high, we passed, and here <br />
Looked downward on the lawns, in clear survey <br />
Of such great spirits as are my glory and pride <br />
That once I saw them. <br />
There, direct in view, <br />
Electra passed, among her sons. I knew <br />
Hector and &amp;AELIG;neas there; and C&aelig;sar too <br />
Was of them, armed and falcon-eyed; and there <br />
Camilla and Penthesilea. Near there sate <br />
Lavinia, with her sire the Latian king; <br />
Brutus, who drave the Tarquin; and Lucrece <br />
Julia, Cornelia, Marcia, and their kin; <br />
And, by himself apart, the Saladin.</p>
<p>Somewhat beyond I looked. A place more high <br />
Than where these heroes moved I gazed, and knew <br />
The Master of reasoned thought, whose hand withdrew <br />
The curtain of the intellect, and bared <br />
The secret things of nature; while anigh, <br />
But lowlier, grouped the greatest names that shared <br />
His searchings. All regard and all revere <br />
They gave him. Plato there, and Socrates <br />
I marked, who closeliest reached his height; and near <br />
Democritus, who dreamed a world of chance <br />
Born blindly in the whirl of circumstance; <br />
And Anaxagoras, Diogenes, <br />
Thales, Heraclitus, Empedocles, <br />
Zeno, were there; and Dioscorides <br />
Who searched the healing powers of herbs and trees; <br />
And Orpheus, Tullius, Livius, Seneca, <br />
Euclid and Ptolem&aelig;us; Avicenna, <br />
Galen, Hippocrates; Averrho&euml;s, <br />
The Master&#8217;s great interpreter, &#8211; but these <br />
Are few to those I saw, an endless dream <br />
Of shades before whom Hell quietened and cowered. My theme, <br />
With thronging recollections of mighty names <br />
That there I marked impedes me. All too long <br />
They chase me, envious that my burdened song <br />
Forgets. &#8211; But onward moves my guide anew: <br />
The light behind us fades: the six are two: <br />
Again the shuddering air, the cries of Hell <br />
Compassed, and where we walked the darkness fell.</p>
<p>
Canto V</p>
<p>
MOST like the spirals of a pointed shell, <br />
But separate each, go downward, hell from hell, <br />
The ninefold circles of the damned; but each <br />
Smaller, concentrate in its greater pain, <br />
Than that which overhangs it. <br />
Those who reach <br />
The second whorl, on entering, learn their bane <br />
Where Minos, hideous, sits and snarls. He hears, <br />
Decides, and as he girds himself they go.</p>
<p>Before his seat each ill-born spirit appear, <br />
And tells its tale of evil, loath or no, <br />
While he, their judge, of all sins cognizant, <br />
Hears, and around himself his circling tail <br />
Twists to the number of the depths below <br />
To which they doom themselves in telling. <br />
Alway <br />
The crowding sinners: their turn they wait: they show <br />
Their guilt: the circles of his tail convey <br />
Their doom: and downward they are whirled away.</p>
<p>&#8220;O thou who callest at this doleful inn,&#8221; <br />
Cried Minos to me, while the child of sin <br />
That stood confessing before him, trembling stayed, <br />
&#8220;Heed where thou enterest in thy trust, nor say, <br />
I walk in safety, for the width of way <br />
Suffices.&#8221; <br />
But my guide the answer took, <br />
&#8220;Why dost thou cry? or leave thine ordered trade <br />
For that which nought belongs thee? Hinder not <br />
His destined path. For where he goeth is willed, <br />
Where that is willed prevaileth.&#8221; <br />
Now was filled <br />
The darker air with wailing. Wailing shook <br />
My soul to hear it. Where we entered now <br />
No light attempted. Only sound arose, <br />
As ocean with the tortured air contends, <br />
What time intolerable tempest rends <br />
The darkness; so the shrieking winds oppose <br />
For ever, and bear they, as they swerve and sweep, <br />
The doomed disastrous spirits, and whirl aloft, <br />
Backward, and down, nor any rest allow, <br />
Nor pause of such contending wraths as oft <br />
Batter them against the precipitous sides, and there <br />
The shrieks and moanings quench the screaming air, <br />
The cries of their blaspheming. <br />
These are they <br />
That lust made sinful. As the starlings rise <br />
At autumn, darkening all the colder skies, <br />
In crowded troops their wings up-bear, so here <br />
These evil-doers on each contending blast <br />
Were lifted upward, whirled, and downward cast, <br />
And swept around unceasing. Striving airs <br />
Lift them, and hurl, nor ever hope is theirs <br />
Of rest or respite or decreasing pains, <br />
But like the long streaks of the calling cranes <br />
So came they wailing down the winds, to meet <br />
Upsweeping blasts that ever backward beat <br />
Or sideward flung them on their walls. And I &#8211; <br />
&#8220;Master who are they next that drive anigh <br />
So scourged amidst the blackness?&#8221; <br />
&#8220;These,&#8221; he said, <br />
&#8220;So lashed and harried, by that queen are led, <br />
Empress of alien tongues, Semiramis, <br />
Who made her laws her lawless lusts to kiss, <br />
So was she broken by desire; and this <br />
Who comes behind, back-blown and beaten thus, <br />
Love&#8217;s fool, who broke her faith to Sich&aelig;us, <br />
Dido; and bare of all her luxury, <br />
Nile&#8217;s queen, who lost her realm for Antony.&#8221;</p>
<p>And after these, amidst that windy train, <br />
Helen, who soaked in blood the Trojan plain, <br />
And great Achilles I saw, at last whose feet <br />
The same net trammelled; and Tristram, Paris, he showed; <br />
And thousand other along the fated road <br />
Whom love led deathward through disastrous things <br />
He pointed as they passed, until my mind <br />
Was wildered in this heavy pass to find <br />
Ladies so many, and cavaliers and kings <br />
Fallen, and pitying past restraint, I said, <br />
&#8220;Poet, those next that on the wind appear <br />
So light, and constant as they drive or veer <br />
Are parted never, I fain would speak.&#8221; <br />
And he, &#8211; <br />
&#8220;Conjure them by their love, and thou shalt see <br />
Their flight come hither.&#8221; <br />
And when the swerving blast <br />
Most nearly bent, I called them as they passed, <br />
&#8220;O wearied souls, come downward, if the Power <br />
That drives allow ye, for one restful hour.&#8221; <br />
As doves, desirous of their nest at night, <br />
Cleave through the dusk with swift and open flight <br />
Of level-lifting wings, that love makes light, <br />
Will-borne, so downward through the murky air <br />
Came those sad spirits, that not deep Hell&#8217;s despair <br />
Could sunder, parting from the faithless band <br />
That Dido led, and with one voice, as though <br />
One soul controlled them, spake, <br />
&#8220;O Animate! <br />
Who comest through the black malignant air, <br />
Benign among us who this exile bear <br />
For earth ensanguined, if the King of All <br />
Heard those who from the outer darkness call <br />
Entreat him would we for thy peace, that thou <br />
Hast pitied us condemned, misfortunate. &#8211; <br />
Of that which please thee, if the winds allow, <br />
Gladly I tell. Ravenna, on that shore <br />
Where Po finds rest for all his streams, we knew; <br />
And there love conquered. Love, in gentle heart <br />
So quick to take dominion, overthrew <br />
Him with my own fair body, and overbore <br />
Me with delight to please him. Love, which gives <br />
No pardon to the loved, so strongly in me <br />
Was empired, that its rule, as here ye see, <br />
Endureth, nor the bitter blast contrives <br />
To part us. Love to one death led us. The mode <br />
Afflicts me, shrinking, still. The place of Cain <br />
Awaits our slayer.&#8221; <br />
They ceased, and I my head <br />
Bowed down, and made no answer, till my guide <br />
Questioned, &#8220;What wouldst thou more?&#8221; and replied, <br />
&#8220;Alas my thought I what sweet keen longings led <br />
These spirits, woeful, to their dark abode!&#8221; <br />
And then to them, &#8211; &#8220;Francesca, all thy pain <br />
Is mine. With pity and grief I weep. But say <br />
How, in the time of sighing, and in what way, <br />
Love gave you of the dubious deeds to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she to me, &#8220;There is no greater woe <br />
In all Hell&#8217;s depths than cometh when those who <br />
Look back to Eden. But if thou wouldst learn <br />
Our love&#8217;s first root, I can but weep and tell. <br />
One day, and for delight in idleness, <br />
- Alone we were, without suspicion, &#8211; <br />
We read together, and chanced the page to turn <br />
Where Galahad tells the tale of Lancelot, <br />
How love constrained him. Oft our meeting eyes, <br />
Confessed the theme, and conscious cheeks were hot, <br />
Reading, but only when that instant came <br />
Where the surrendering lips were kissed, no less <br />
Desire beat in us, and whom, for all this pain, <br />
No hell shall sever (so great at least our gain), <br />
Trembling, he kissed my mouth, and all forgot, <br />
We read no more.&#8221; <br />
As thus did one confess <br />
Their happier days, the other wept, and I <br />
Grew faint with pity, and sank as those who die.</p>
<p>
Canto VI</p>
<p>
THE misery of that sight of souls in Hell <br />
Condemned, and constant in their loss, prevailed <br />
So greatly in me, that I may not tell <br />
How passed I from them, sense and memory failed <br />
So far. <br />
But here new torments I discern, <br />
And new tormented, wheresoe&#8217;er I turn. <br />
For sodden around me was the place of bane, <br />
The third doomed circle, where the culprits know <br />
The cold, unceasing, and relentless rain <br />
Pour down without mutation. Heavy with hail, <br />
With turbid waters mixed, and cold with snow, <br />
It streams from out the darkness, and below <br />
The soil is putrid, where the impious lie <br />
Grovelling, and howl like dogs, beneath the flail <br />
That flattens to the foul soaked ground, and try <br />
Vainly for ease by turning. And the while <br />
Above them roams and ravens the loathsome hound <br />
Cerberus, and feeds upon them. <br />
The swampy ground <br />
He ranges; with his long clawed hands he grips <br />
The sinners, and the fierce and hairy lips <br />
(Thrice-headed is he) tear, and the red blood drips <br />
From all his jaws. He clutches, and flays, and rends, <br />
And treads them, growling: and the flood descends <br />
Straight downward. <br />
When he saw us, the loathly worm <br />
Showed all his fangs, and eager trembling frame <br />
Nerved for the leap. But undeterred my guide. <br />
Stooped down, and gathered in full hands the soil, <br />
And cast it in the gaping gullets, to foil <br />
Gluttonous blind greed, and those fierce mouths and wide <br />
Closed on the filth, and as the craving cur <br />
Quietens, that strained and howled to reach his food, <br />
Biting the bone, those squalid mouths subdued <br />
And silenced, wont above the empty dead <br />
To bark insatiate, while they tore unfed <br />
The writhing shadows. <br />
The straight persistent rain, <br />
That altered never, had pressed the miry plain <br />
With flattened shades that in their emptiness <br />
Still showed as bodies. We might not here progress <br />
Except we trod them. Of them all, but one <br />
Made motion as we passed. Against the rain <br />
Rising, and resting on one hand, he said, <br />
&#8220;O thou, who through the drenching murk art led, <br />
Recall me if thou canst. Thou wast begun <br />
Before I ended.&#8221; <br />
I, who looked in vain <br />
For human semblance in that bestial shade, <br />
Made answer, &#8220;Misery here hath all unmade, <br />
It may be, that thou wast on earth, for nought <br />
Recalls thee to me. But thyself shalt tell <br />
The sins that scourged thee to this foul resort, <br />
That more displeasing not the scope of Hell <br />
Can likely yield, though greater pains may lie <br />
More deep.&#8221; <br />
And he to me, &#8220;Thy city, so high <br />
With envious hates that swells, that now the sack <br />
Bursts, and pours out in ruin, and spreads its wrack <br />
Far outward, was mine alike, while clearer air <br />
Still breathed I. Citizens who knew me there <br />
Called me Ciacco. For the vice I fed <br />
At rich men&#8217;s tables, in this filth I lie <br />
Drenched, beaten, hungered, cold, uncomforted, <br />
Mauled by that ravening greed; and these, as I, <br />
With gluttonous lives the like reward have won.&#8221;</p>
<p>I answered, &#8220;Piteous is thy state to one <br />
Who knew thee in thine old repute, but say, <br />
If yet persists thy previous mind, which way <br />
The feuds of our rent city shall end, and why <br />
These factions vex us, and if still there be <br />
One just man left among us.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Two,&#8221; said he, <br />
&#8220;Are just, but none regards them. Yet more high <br />
The strife, till bloodshed from their long contend <br />
Shall issue at last: the barbarous Cerchi clan <br />
Cast the Donati exiled out, and they <br />
Within three years return, and more offend <br />
Than they were erst offended, helped by him <br />
So long who palters with both parts. The fire <br />
Three sparks have lighted &#8211; Avarice, Envy, Pride, &#8211; <br />
And there is none may quench it.&#8221; <br />
Here he ceased <br />
His lamentable tale, and I replied, <br />
&#8220;Of one thing more I ask thee. Great desire <br />
Is mine to learn it. Where are those who sought <br />
Our welfare earlier? Those whose names at least <br />
Are fragrant for the public good they wrought, <br />
Arrigo, Mosca, and the Tegghiaio <br />
Worthiest, and Farinata, and with these <br />
Jacopo Rusticucci. I would know <br />
If soft in Heaven or bitter-hard in Hell <br />
Their lives continue.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Cast in hells more low <br />
Than yet thou hast invaded, deep they lie, <br />
For different crimes from ours, and shouldst thou go <br />
So far, thou well mayst see them. If thou tread <br />
Again the sweet light land, and overhead <br />
Converse with those I knew there, then recall, <br />
I pray, my memory to my friends of yore. <br />
But ask no further, for I speak no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereon his eyes, that straight had gazed before <br />
Squinted and failed, and slowly sank his head, <br />
And blindly with his sodden mates he lay. <br />
And spake my guide, &#8220;He shall not lift nor stir, <br />
Until the trumpet shrills that wakens Hell; <br />
And these, who must inimical Power obey, <br />
Shall each return to his sad grave, and there <br />
In carnal form the sinful spirit shall dwell <br />
Once more, and that time only, from the tomb <br />
Rising to hear the irrevocable doom <br />
Which shall reverberate through eternity.&#8221;</p>
<p>So paced we slowly through the rain that fell <br />
Unchanging, over that foul ground, and trod <br />
The dismal spirits it held, and somewhat spake <br />
Of life beyond us, and the things of God; <br />
And asked I, &#8220;Master, shall these torments cease, <br />
Continue as they are, or more increase, <br />
When calls the trumpet, and the graves shall break, <br />
And the great Sentence sound?&#8221; <br />
And he to me, <br />
&#8220;Recall thy learning, as thou canst. We know <br />
With more perfection, greater pain or bliss <br />
Resolves, and though perfection may not be <br />
To these accurs&#8217;d, yet nearer then than this <br />
It may be they shall reach it.&#8221; <br />
More to show <br />
He sought, as turned we to the fresh descent, <br />
But speaking all in such strange words as went <br />
Past me. &#8211; But ceased our downward path, and <br />
Plutus, of human weal the hateful foe.</p>
<p>
Canto VII</p>
<p>
HAH, strange! ho, Satan!&#8221; such the sounds half-heard <br />
The thick voice gobbled, the while the foul, inflamed, <br />
Distended visage toward us turned, and cast <br />
Invective from its bestial throat, that slurred <br />
Articulate speech. But here the gentle sage, <br />
Who knew beforehand that we faced, to me <br />
Spake first, &#8220;Regard not; for a threat misaimed <br />
Falls idle. Fear not to continue past. <br />
His power to us, however else it be, <br />
Is not to hinder.&#8221; Then, that bulk inflate <br />
Confronting, &#8211; &#8220;Peace, thou greed! thy lusting rage <br />
Consume thee inward! Not thy word we wait <br />
The path to open. It is willed on high, &#8211; <br />
There, where the Angel of the Sword ye know <br />
Took ruin upon the proud adultery <br />
Of him thou callest as thy prince.&#8221; <br />
Thereat <br />
As sails, wind-rounded, when the mast gives way, <br />
Sink tangled to the deck, deflated so <br />
Collapsed that bulk that heard him, shrunk and flat; <br />
And we went downward till before us lay <br />
The fourth sad circle. Ah! what woes contain, <br />
Justice of God! what woes those narrowing deeps <br />
Contain; for all the universe down-heaps <br />
In this pressed space its continent of pain, <br />
So voiding all that mars its peace. But why <br />
This guilt that so degrades us? <br />
As the surge <br />
Above Charybdis meets contending surge, <br />
Breaks and is broken, and rages and recoils <br />
For ever, so here the sinners. More numerous <br />
Than in the circles past are these. They urge <br />
Huge weights before them. On, with straining breasts, <br />
They roll them, howling in their ceaseless toils. <br />
And those that to the further side belong <br />
l)o likewise, meeting in the midst, and thus <br />
Crash vainly, and recoil, reverse, and cry, <br />
&#8220;Why dost thou hold?&#8221; &#8220;Why dost thou loose?&#8221; <br />
No rest <br />
Their doom permits them. Backward course they bend; <br />
Continual crescents trace, at either end <br />
Meeting again in fresh rebound, and high <br />
Above their travail reproachful howlings rise <br />
Incessant at those who thwart their round. <br />
And I, <br />
Who felt my heart stung through with anguish, said, <br />
&#8220;O Master, show me who these peoples be, <br />
And if those tonsured shades that left we see <br />
Held priestly office ere they joined the dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered, &#8220;These, who with such squinting eyes <br />
Regarded God&#8217;s providing, that they spent <br />
In waste immoderate, indicate their guilt <br />
In those loud barkings that ye hear. They spilt <br />
Their wealth distemperate; and those they meet <br />
Who cry &#8216;Why loose ye?&#8217; avarice ruled: they bent <br />
Their minds on earth to seize and hoard. Of these <br />
Hairless, are priests, and popes, and cardinals, <br />
For greed makes empire in such hearts complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I, &#8220;Among them that these vices eat <br />
Are none that I have known on earth before?&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered, &#8220;Vainly wouldst thou seek; a life <br />
So blind to bounties has obscured too far <br />
The souls once theirs, for that which once they wore <br />
Of mortal likeness in their shades to show. <br />
Waste was their choice, and this abortive strife <br />
And toil unmeaning is the end they are <br />
They butt for ever, until the last award <br />
Shall call them from their graves. Ill-holding those <br />
Ill-loosing these, alike have doomed to know <br />
This darkness, and the fairer world forgo. <br />
Behold what mockery doth their fate afford! <br />
It needs no fineness of spun words to tell. <br />
For this they did their subtle wits oppose, <br />
Contending for the gifts that Fortune straws <br />
So blindly, &#8211; for this blind contending hell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beneath the moon there is not gold so great <br />
In worth, it could one moment&#8217;s grief abate, <br />
Or rest one only of these weary souls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Master, this Fortune that ye speak, whose claws <br />
Grasp all desirable things of earth,&#8221; I said, <br />
&#8220;What is she?&#8221; <br />
&#8220;O betrayed in foolishness I <br />
Blindness of creatures born of earth, whose goals <br />
Are folly and loss!&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I would make <br />
Thy mouth an opening for this truth I show.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transcendent Wisdom, when the spheres He built <br />
Gave each a guide to rule it: more nor less <br />
Their light distributes. For the earth he gave <br />
Like guide to rule its splendours. As we know <br />
The heavenly lights move round us, and is spilt <br />
Light here, and darkness yonder, so doth she <br />
From man to man, from race and kindred take <br />
Alternate wealth, or yield it. None may save <br />
The spoil that she depriveth: none may flee <br />
The bounty that she wills. No human wits <br />
May hinder, nor may human lore reject <br />
Her choice, that like a hidden snake is set <br />
To reach the feet unheeding. Where she sits <br />
In judgment, she resolves, and whom she wills <br />
Is havened, chased by petulant storms, or wreck &#8216; <br />
Remedeless. Races cease, and men forget <br />
They were. Slaves rise to rule their lords. She <br />
And empties, godlike in her mood. No pause <br />
Her changes leave, so many are those who call <br />
About her gates, so many she dowers, and all <br />
Revile her after, and would crucify <br />
If words could reach her, but she heeds nor hears, <br />
Who dwells beyond the noise of human laws <br />
In the blest silence of the Primal Spheres.</p>
<p>- But let us to the greater woes descend. <br />
The stars from their meridian fall, that rose <br />
When first these hells we entered. Long to stay <br />
Our right of path allows not.&#8221; <br />
While he spake <br />
We crossed the circle to the bank beyond, <br />
And found a hot spring boiling, and a way, <br />
Dark, narrow, and steep, that down beside it goes, <br />
By which we clambered. Purple-black the pond <br />
Beneath it, widening to a marsh that spreads <br />
Far out, and struggling in that slime malign <br />
Were muddied shades, that not with hands, heads, <br />
And teeth and feet besides, contending tore, <br />
And maimed each other in beast-like rage. <br />
My guide <br />
Expounded, &#8220;Those whom anger overbore <br />
On earth, behold ye. Mark the further sign <br />
Of bubbles countless on the slime that show. <br />
These from the sobs of those immersed arise; <br />
For buried in the choking filth they cry, <br />
We once were sullen in the rain-sweet air, <br />
When waked the light, and all the earth was fair, <br />
How sullen in the murky swamp we lie <br />
Forbidden from the blessed light on high. <br />
This song they gurgle in their throats, that so <br />
The bubbles rising from the depths below <br />
Break all the surface of the slime.&#8221; <br />
Between <br />
The high bank and the putrid swamp was seen <br />
A narrow path, and this, a sweeping arc, <br />
We traversed; outward o&#8217;er the surface dark <br />
Still gazing, at the choking shades who took <br />
That diet for their wrath. Till livelier look <br />
Was forward drawn, for where at last we came <br />
A great tower fronted, and a beacon&#8217;s flame.</p>
<p>
Canto VIII</p>
<p>
I SAY, while yet from that tower&#8217;s base afar, <br />
We saw two flames of sudden signal rise, <br />
And further, like a small and distant star, <br />
A beacon answered. <br />
&#8220;What before us lies? <br />
Who signals our approach, and who replies?&#8221; <br />
I asked, and answered he who all things knew, <br />
&#8220;Already, if the swamp&#8217;s dank fumes permit, <br />
The outcome of their beacon shows in view, <br />
Severing the liquid filth.&#8221; <br />
No shaft can slit <br />
Impalpable air, from any corded bow, <br />
As came that craft towards us, cleaving so, <br />
And with incredible speed, the miry wave. <br />
To where we paused its meteor course it clave, <br />
A steersman rising in the stern, who cried, <br />
&#8220;Behold thy doom, lost spirit!&#8221; To whom my guide, <br />
&#8220;Nay, Phlegyas, Phlegyas, here thy cries are <br />
We need thine aid the further shore to gain; <br />
But power thou hast not.&#8221; <br />
One amazed to meet <br />
With most unlooked and undeserved deceit <br />
So rages inly; yet no dared reply <br />
There came, as down my Leader stept, and I <br />
Deepened the skiff with earthly weight undue, <br />
Which while we seated swung its bows anew <br />
Outward, and onward once again it flew, <br />
Labouring more deep than wont, and slowlier now, <br />
So burdened. <br />
While that kennel of filth we clave, <br />
There rose among the bubbles a mud-soaked head. <br />
&#8220;Who art thou, here before thy time?&#8221; it said, <br />
And answer to the unfeatured mask I gave, <br />
&#8220;I come, but stay not. Who art thou, so blind <br />
And blackened from the likeness of thy kind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no name, but only tears,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>I answered, &#8220;Nay, however caked thou be, <br />
I know thee through the muddied drench. For thee <br />
Be weeping ever, accursed spirit.&#8221; <br />
At that, <br />
He reached his hands to grasp the boat, whereat <br />
My watchful Master thrust him down, and cried, <br />
&#8220;Away, among the dogs, thy fellows!&#8221; and then <br />
To me with approbation, &#8220;Blest art thou, <br />
Who wouldst not pity in thy heart allow <br />
For these, in arrogance of empty pride <br />
Who lived so vainly. In the minds of men <br />
Is no good thing of this one left to tell, <br />
And hence his rage. How many above that dwell, <br />
Now kinglike in their ways, at last shall lie <br />
Wallowing in these wide marshes, swine in sty, <br />
With all men&#8217;s scorn to chase them down.&#8221; <br />
And I, <br />
&#8220;Master, it were a seemly thing to see <br />
This boaster trampled in the putrid sea, <br />
Who dared approach us, knowing of all we know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered, &#8220;Well thy wish, and surely so <br />
It shall be, e&#8217;er the distant shore we view.&#8221; <br />
And I looked outward through the gloom, and lo! <br />
The envious eaters of that dirt combined <br />
Against him, leapt upon him, before, behind, <br />
Dragged in their fury, and rent, and tore him through, <br />
Screaming derisive, &#8220;Philip! whose horse-hooves shine <br />
With silver,&#8221; and the rageful Florentine <br />
Turned on himself his gnashing teeth and tore.</p>
<p>But he deserveth, and I speak, no more.</p>
<p>Now, as we neared the further beach, I heard <br />
The lamentable and unceasing wail <br />
By which the air of all the hells is stirred <br />
Increasing ever, which caused mine eyes unveil <br />
Their keenest vision to search what came, and he <br />
Who marked, indulgent, told. &#8220;Ahead we see <br />
The city of Dis, with all its dolorous crew, <br />
Numerous, and burdened with reliefless pain, <br />
And guilt intolerable to think.&#8221; <br />
I said, <br />
&#8220;Master, already through the night I view <br />
The mosques of that sad city, that fiery red <br />
As heated metal extend, and crowd the plain.&#8221; <br />
He answered, &#8220;These the eternal fire contain, <br />
That pulsing through them sets their domes aglow.&#8221; <br />
At this we came those joyless walls below, <br />
- Of iron I thought them, &#8211; with a circling moat; <br />
But saw no entrance, and the burdened boat <br />
Traced the deep fosse for half its girth, before <br />
The steersman warned us. &#8220;Get ye forth. The shore <br />
Is here, &#8211; and there the Entrance.&#8221; <br />
There, indeed, <br />
The entrance. On the barred and burning gate <br />
I gazed; a thousand of the fiends that rained <br />
From Heaven, to fill that place disconsolate, <br />
Looked downward, and derided. &#8220;Who,&#8221; they said, <br />
&#8220;Before his time comes hither? As though the dead <br />
Arrive too slowly for the joys they would,&#8221; <br />
And laughter rocked along their walls. My guide <br />
Their mockery with an equal mien withstood, <br />
Signalling their leaders he would speak aside, <br />
And somewhat closing their contempt they cried, <br />
&#8220;Then come thou hither, and let him backward go, <br />
Who came so rashly. Let him find his way <br />
Through the five hells ye traversed, the best he may. <br />
He can but try it awhile! &#8211; But thou shalt stay, <br />
And learn the welcome of these halls of woe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ye well may think how I, discomforted <br />
By these accursed words, was moved. The dead, <br />
Nay, nor the living were ever placed as I, <br />
If this fiends&#8217; counsel triumphed. And who should try <br />
That backward path unaided? <br />
&#8220;Lord,&#8221; I said, <br />
&#8220;Loved Master, who hast shared my steps so far, <br />
And rescued ever, if these our path would bar, <br />
Then lead me backward in most haste, nor let <br />
Their malice part us.&#8221; <br />
He with cheerful mien, <br />
Gave answer. &#8220;Heed not that they boast. Forget <br />
The fear thou showest, and in good heart abide, <br />
While I go forward. Not these fiends obscene <br />
Shall thwart the mandate that the Power supplied <br />
By which we came, nor any force to do <br />
The things they threaten is theirs; nor think that I <br />
Should leave thee helpless here.&#8221; <br />
The gentle Sage <br />
At this went forward. Feared I? Half I knew <br />
Despair, and half contentment. Yes and no <br />
Denied each other; and of so great a woe <br />
Small doubt is anguish. <br />
In their orgulous rage <br />
The fiends out-crowded from the gates to meet <br />
My Master; what he spake I could not hear; <br />
But nothing his words availed to cool their heat, <br />
For inward thronged they with a jostling rear <br />
That clanged the gates before he reached, and he <br />
Turned backward slowly, muttering, &#8220;Who to me <br />
Denies the woeful houses?&#8221; This he said <br />
Sighing, with downcast aspect and disturbed <br />
Beyond concealment; yet some length he curbed <br />
His anxious thought to cheer me. &#8220;Doubt ye nought <br />
Of power to hurt in these fiends insolent; <br />
For once the wider gate on which ye read <br />
The words of doom, with greater pride, they sought <br />
To close against the Highest. Already is bent <br />
A great One hereward, whose unhindered way <br />
Descends the steeps unaided. He shall say <br />
Such words as must the trembling hells obey.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Canto IX</p>
<p>
I THINK the paleness of the fear I showed <br />
When he, rejected from that conference, <br />
Rejoined me, caused him speak more confident <br />
Than felt he inly. For the glance he sent <br />
Through the dense darkness of the backward road <br />
Denied the valour of his words&#8217; pretence; <br />
And pausing there with anxious listening mien, <br />
While came no sound, nor any help was seen, <br />
He muttered, &#8220;Yet we must this conflict win, <br />
For else &#8211; But whom her aid has pledged herein &#8211; <br />
How long before he cometh!&#8221; And plain I knew <br />
His words turned sideward from the ending due <br />
They first portended. Faster beat my fear, <br />
Methinks, than had he framed in words more clear <br />
The meaning that his care withheld. <br />
I said, <br />
&#8220;Do others of the hopeless, sinless, dead, <br />
Who with thee in the outmost circle dwell, <br />
Come ever downward to the narrowing hell <br />
That now we traverse?&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Once Erichtho fell,&#8221; <br />
He answered, &#8220;conjured to such end that I, <br />
- Who then short time had passed to those who die, &#8211; <br />
Came here, controlled by her discerning spell, <br />
And entered through these hostile gates, and drew <br />
A spirit from the darkest, deepest pit, <br />
The place of Judas named, that centres Hell. <br />
The path I learnt, and all its dangers well. <br />
Content thine heart. This foul-stretched marsh surrounds <br />
The dolorous city to its furthest bounds. <br />
Without, the dense mirk, and the bubbling mire: <br />
Within, the white-hot pulse of eating fire, <br />
Whence this fiend-anger thwarts. . .,&#8221; and more he said, <br />
To save me doubtless from my thoughts, but I <br />
Heeded no more, for by the beacons red <br />
That on the lofty tower before us glowed, <br />
Three bloodstained and infernal furies showed, <br />
Erect, of female form in guise and limb, <br />
But clothed in coils of hydras green and grim; <br />
And with cerastes bound was every head, <br />
And for its crown of hair was serpented; <br />
And he, who followed my diverted gaze, <br />
The handmaids of the Queen of Woeful Days <br />
Well knowing, told me, &#8220;These the Furies three. <br />
Meg&aelig;ra leftward: on the right is she <br />
Alecto, wailing: and Tisiphone <br />
Midmost.&#8221; <br />
These hateful, in their need of prey, <br />
Tore their own breasts with bloodied claws, and when <br />
They saw me, from the living world of men, <br />
Beneath them standing, with one purpose they <br />
Cried, and so loudly that I shrank for fear, <br />
&#8220;Medusa! let her from her place appear, <br />
To change him into stone! Our first default <br />
That venged no wrath on Theseus&#8217; deep assault, <br />
So brings him.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Turn thou from their sight,&#8221; my guide <br />
Enjoined, nor wholly on my fear relied, <br />
But placed his hands across mine eyes the while <br />
He told me further &#8220;Risk no glance. The sight <br />
Of Gorgon, if she cometh, would bring thee night <br />
From which were no returning.&#8221; <br />
Ye that read <br />
With wisdom to discern, ye well may heed <br />
The hidden meaning of the truth that lies <br />
Beneath the shadow-words of mysteries <br />
That here I show ye. <br />
While I turned away, <br />
Across the blackness of the putrid bay, <br />
There crashed a thunder of most fearful sound, <br />
At which the opposing shores, from bound to bound, <br />
Trembled. <br />
As when an entering tempest rends <br />
The brooding heat, and nought its course can stay, <br />
That through the forest its dividing way <br />
Tears open, and tramples down, and strips, and bends, <br />
And levels. The wild things in the woods that be <br />
Cower down. The herdsmen from its trumpets flee. <br />
With clouds of dust to trace its course it goes, <br />
Superb, and leaving ruin. Such sound arose. <br />
And he that held me loosened mine eyes, and said, <br />
&#8220;Look back, and see what foam the black waves bear.&#8221;</p>
<p>As frogs, the while the serpent picks his prey, <br />
In panic scatter through the stream, and there <br />
Flatten themselves upon its bouldered bed, <br />
I saw a thousand ruined spirits that fled <br />
Before the coming of One who held his way <br />
Dry-shod across the water. <br />
His left hand <br />
He waved before him, and the stagnant air <br />
Retreated. Simple it were to understand <br />
A Messenger of Heaven he came. My guide <br />
Signed me to silence, and to reverence due, <br />
While to one stroke of his indignant wand <br />
The gate swung open. &#8220;Outcast spawn!&#8221; he cried, <br />
His voice heard vibrant through the aperture grim, <br />
&#8220;Why spurn ye at the Will that, once defied, <br />
Here cast ye grovelling? Have ye felt from Him <br />
Aught ever for fresh revolt but harder pains? <br />
Has Cerberus&#8217; throat, skinned with the threefold chains, <br />
No meaning? Why, to fate most impotent, <br />
Contend ye vainly?&#8221; <br />
Then he turned and went, <br />
Nor one glance gave us, but he seemed as one <br />
Whom larger issue than the instant done <br />
Engages wholly. <br />
By that Power compelled, <br />
The gates stood open, and our course we held <br />
Unhindered. As the threshold dread we crossed, <br />
My eager glances swept the scene to know, <br />
In those doomed walls imprisoned, how lived the lost.</p>
<p>On either hand a wide plain stretched, to show <br />
A sight of torment, and most dismal woe.</p>
<p>At Arles, where the stagnant Rhone extends, <br />
Or Pola, where the gulf Quarnero bends, <br />
As with old tombs the plains are ridged, so here, <br />
All sides, did rows of countless tombs appear, <br />
But in more bitter a guise, for everywhere <br />
Shone flames, that moved among them. <br />
Every tomb <br />
Stood open, white with heat. No craft requires <br />
More heated metal than the crawling fires <br />
Made hot the sides of those sad sepulchres; <br />
And cries of torture and most dire despair <br />
Came from them, as the spirits wailed their doom.</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;Who are they, in these chests that lie <br />
Confined, and join in this lamenting cry?&#8221;</p>
<p>My Master answered, &#8220;These in life denied <br />
The faith that saves, and that resisting pride <br />
Here brought them. With their followers, like to like, <br />
Assorted are they, and the keen flames strike <br />
With differing anguish, to the same degree <br />
They reached in their rebellion.&#8221; <br />
While he spake <br />
Rightward he turned, a narrow path to take <br />
Between them and that high-walled boundary.</p>
<p>
Canto X</p>
<p>
FIRST went my Master, for the space was small <br />
Between the torments and the lofty wall, <br />
And I behind him. <br />
&#8220;O controlling Will,&#8221; <br />
I spake, &#8220;who leadest through such hates, and still <br />
Prevailest for me, wilt thou speak, that who <br />
Within these tombs are held mine eyes may see? <br />
For lifted are they, and unwatched.&#8221; <br />
And he, &#8211; <br />
&#8220;The lids stand open till the time arrive <br />
When to the valley of Jehoshaphat <br />
They each must wend, and earthly flesh resume, <br />
And back returning, as the swarming hive, <br />
From condemnation, each the doleful tomb <br />
Re-enter wailing, and the lids thereat <br />
Be bolted. Here in fitting torment lie <br />
The Epicurean horde, who dared deny <br />
That soul outlasts its mortal home. Is here <br />
Their leader, and his followers round him. Soon <br />
Shall all thy wish be granted, &#8211; and the boon <br />
Ye hold in secret.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Kind my guide,&#8221; I said, <br />
&#8220;I was not silent to conceal, but thou <br />
Didst teach, when in thy written words I read, <br />
That in brief speech is wisdom.&#8221; <br />
Here a voice <br />
Behind me, &#8220;Tuscan, who canst walk at choice <br />
Untouched amidst the torments, wilt thou stay? <br />
For surely native of the noble land <br />
Where once I held my too-audacious way, <br />
Discreet of speech, thou comest.&#8221; <br />
The sudden cry <br />
So close behind me from the chests that came, <br />
First drove me closer to my guide, but he, &#8211; <br />
&#8220;What dost thou? Turn thee!&#8221; &#8211; and a kindly hand <br />
Impelled me, fearful, where the crawling flame <br />
Was all around me, &#8211; &#8220;Lift thine eyes and see, <br />
For there is Farinata. Be thou short <br />
In speech, for time is failing.&#8221; <br />
Scorn of hell <br />
Was in the eyes that met me. Hard he wrought <br />
To raise himself, till girdle-deep I knew <br />
The greatest of the fierce Uberti crew, <br />
Who asked me, with contempt near-waiting, &#8220;Tell <br />
Of whom thou art descended?&#8221; <br />
I replied, <br />
Concealing nothing. With lifted brows he eyed <br />
My face in silence some brief while, and then, &#8211; <br />
&#8220;Foes were they ever to my part, and me. <br />
It yet must linger in the minds of men <br />
How twice I broke them.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Twice ye learned them flee,&#8221; <br />
- I answered boldly, &#8211; &#8220;but they twice returned; <br />
And others fled more late who have not learned <br />
The mode of that returning.&#8221; <br />
Here a shade <br />
Arose beside him, only to the chin <br />
Revealed: I think it knelt. Beyond and round <br />
It rather looked than at me. Nought it found. <br />
Thereat it wept, and asked me, &#8220;Ye that go <br />
Unhindered through these homes of gateless woe, &#8211; <br />
Is my son with thee? Hast thou nought to tell?&#8221;</p>
<p>I answered, &#8220;Single through the gates of hell <br />
I had no power to enter. Near my guide <br />
Awaits me yonder. &#8211; Whom in foolish pride, <br />
Thy Guido held so lightly.&#8221; <br />
At the word <br />
He leapt erect from out the tomb, and cried, <br />
&#8220;How saidst thou? Held? Already he hath not died? <br />
Doth not the sweet light meet him? The clear air <br />
Breathes he not yet?&#8221; <br />
The imploring cries I heard <br />
But checked awhile to answer, and in despair <br />
He fell flat forward, and was seen no more. <br />
But he, magnanimous, who first delayed <br />
My steps, had heeded nought, nor turned his head, <br />
And now continued that he spake before. <br />
&#8220;If with the coin ye forged they have not paid, <br />
It more torments me than this flaming bed. <br />
Yet thou thyself, before the Queen of Night <br />
Shall fifty times revoke and raise her light, <br />
Shalt learn the hardship of that art. But tell, <br />
As thou wouldst feel the cool winds&#8217; pinions beat <br />
Once more upon thee, and the sweet light fall <br />
Around the feet of morning, for this heat <br />
And fetid air we writhe in, why were all <br />
Those exiles pardoned by thy laws, to dwell <br />
In their dear homes once more, and only mine, <br />
My kindred, find no mercy?&#8221; <br />
I to him, &#8211; <br />
&#8220;The rout and chase that dyed the Arbia red <br />
To thy descendants dealt this bitter bread; <br />
The memory of that slaughter doth not dim, <br />
But leaves thee to our prayers a name of hate <br />
In all our churches.&#8221; <br />
Here he sighed, and said, <br />
&#8220;I was not single in that strife, nor lacked <br />
Good cause to strike; but when your remnant fled, <br />
And Florence, naked to her foes elate, <br />
Cowered, waiting, all with one consent agreed <br />
To tread her out to dust, and extirpate <br />
All life within her, I, and only I, <br />
Stood out against it, and refused the deed, <br />
And with my swords I saved them. Is this thing <br />
Less memoried than my wrath?&#8221; <br />
I answered, &#8220;Yea: <br />
But what I can I will, and that thy seed <br />
Have rest at my returning, solve, I pray, <br />
A doubt that disconcerts me. Ye that dwell <br />
In these abodes beneath us, each foretell <br />
- Or so ye claim &#8211; what distant times shall bring, <br />
Yet plead for knowledge of the passing day, &#8211; <br />
Or mock me, asking that yourselves could say.&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered, &#8220;As in age a man may see <br />
Far off, while nearer sights are blurred, so we <br />
See clearly times long passed, and times to be. <br />
Foresight is ours, and long remembering, <br />
In each an anguish, while the anxious mind <br />
Is void to all around it, foiled and blind <br />
Where most it longs for knowledge. Nought we know <br />
Thine earthly present, save as here below <br />
One after one descending bears his tale; <br />
And therefore, when the wings of Time shall fail, <br />
And sealed in these accursed tombs we lie, <br />
All knowledge from our vacant minds shall die, <br />
As well ye may perceive it.&#8221; <br />
Here I said, <br />
Compunctious for a fault now seen, &#8220;Wilt tell <br />
That other, fallen, that I did not well <br />
Withholding answer? Guido is not dead. <br />
My silence from the earlier doubt was bred, <br />
From which thou hast resolved me.&#8221; <br />
Now my guide <br />
Was calling, and in greater haste I said, <br />
&#8220;Thy comrades in thy grief I charge thee tell, <br />
Ere I go from thee.&#8221; <br />
Shortly he replied, <br />
&#8220;The second Frederick, and the Cardinal, <br />
Are with me, and a thousand more beside <br />
Of whom I speak not.&#8221; <br />
With the word he fell; <br />
And I went onward, turning in my thought <br />
The hostile presage of his words that taught <br />
Mine own near exile, till my guide at last <br />
Questioned, &#8220;What cloud thine eyes hath overcast? <br />
What thought hath wildered all thy mind?&#8221; and I <br />
Answered, and told. <br />
He said, &#8220;The things thou hear&#8217;st <br />
That threat thee, hold them in thy memory well. <br />
Yet know that soon, beneath a fairer sky, <br />
When she, whose sight hath no blank space, shall tell <br />
What cometh, then shalt thou read, ungapped and clear, <br />
The journey of thy life.&#8221; <br />
The while he spake <br />
He turned him leftward from the wall, to take <br />
A path that to the midmost vale declined, <br />
A fetid rising odour first to find.</p>
