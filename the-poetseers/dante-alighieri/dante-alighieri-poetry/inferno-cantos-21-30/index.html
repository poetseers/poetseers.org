				<p>Canto XXI</p>
<p>
NOW looked we downward on a darker ditch <br />
Than those preceding. As the bubbling pitch <br />
Boils in the great Venetian arsenal, <br />
To caulk the wave-beat ships, when winter&#8217;s call <br />
In-herds them from repulsing seas; and there <br />
One builds anew, and one with hard repair <br />
Plugs the cracked ribs that heat and cold have strained, <br />
And many friendless winds have buffeted <br />
In many wanderings on the ocean ways. <br />
One mends the injured stern, and one the head, <br />
One fashions oars, one joins the broken stays, <br />
One sews the jib, one lends his aid to spread <br />
New mainsail for the rotten sheet and stained <br />
That drew them inward. So they toil beside <br />
The pitchy cauldron &#8211; so the boiling here <br />
Filled, like a cauldron, all the trench entire, <br />
That art Divine, and never earthly fire, <br />
So heated. Breaking on the surface wide <br />
Were bubbles only. Nought beside I saw, <br />
Save that the blackness heaved, and then compressed, <br />
Unceasing. <br />
Sight of that retentive maw <br />
Drew my fixed gaze, until my leader&#8217;s cry <br />
Alarmed me sharply, &#8220;Guard thee! Guard!&#8221; and I <br />
Stayed not to look, but toward him leapt, nor guessed <br />
Why called he, till within that safety pressed <br />
Of his sure arm I turned me round, and there, <br />
Across the bridge, a coal-black demon ran. <br />
How closer shrank I from that fierce aspect I <br />
How near the menace of the wings outspread <br />
And lightfoot speed! His shoulders sharp and high <br />
Sustained the haunches of a hanging man, <br />
Whose ankles in his claws were fast. <br />
He said: <br />
&#8220;Ho, Taloned of the Fifth Damnation! Here <br />
Is Santa Zita&#8217;s Elder! Thrust him down! <br />
While I for others of the sinful town <br />
Go backward. Plenty there this goal shall win, <br />
For all men there contrive the barterer&#8217;s sin, <br />
- Except, of course, Bonturo!&#8221; <br />
From the bridge <br />
He cast him, twirling. From that weight&#8217;s relief <br />
Straightening, he mounted up the stony ridge <br />
So swift I thought that never hound on thief <br />
Was loosed so gladly. <br />
Plunging headlong in <br />
The sinner sank, and rose convulsed, and writhed, <br />
Arching his back as one who prays. There came <br />
A cackling laughter from beneath the bridge, <br />
And flying demons rose. &#8220;This Holy Place,&#8221; <br />
They mocked, &#8220;befits a sanctimonious face, <br />
But nought it saves thee from thy bathing. Ho! <br />
Ye swim not here as in the Serchio. <br />
It is not willed a naked part to show, <br />
Except the knives shall slice it.&#8221; <br />
As the cooks <br />
Around the boiler group with waiting prongs, <br />
To thrust the carcase if it rise too far <br />
Above the broth that stews it, so did they <br />
The twisting sinner with a score of hooks, <br />
Clamoring derisive. &#8220;Find thy place below, <br />
Where mayst thou pilfer in thy private way <br />
If aught attract thee there.&#8221; <br />
My Master said, <br />
&#8220;Wait here, and fear not. Where the buttress swells <br />
Crouch down, and hide, and whatsoe&#8217;er to me <br />
Of outrage or repulse you hear or see <br />
You need not tremble. Through the deeper <br />
An earlier time I came, and proved their dread.&#8221;</p>
<p>I crouched &#8211; and trembled. Down the central bridge <br />
He went and left me. Ere he gained the ridge <br />
That barred it from the next succeeding woe <br />
The demons marked him. As the dogs outfly, <br />
White-fanged and deafening, if a varlet show <br />
A mood to linger at the gate, they came, <br />
A rush of wings and drags outreached. Stout heart <br />
He needed surely. But his voice outrang <br />
Steadfast. &#8220;No victim for your rage am I. <br />
Stand back! Ye know the heavy stripes that tame <br />
Revolt. What! Would ye drag me? Stand apart. <br />
Let one come forward. When he learns my name <br />
Then choose ye freely.&#8221; <br />
Croaked the grisly crew, <br />
&#8220;Let Foultail test him,&#8221; and the fiend advanced <br />
Malignly confident. &#8220;What power,&#8221; he said, <br />
&#8220;Delays we bathe thee? Leap, or fork and fang <br />
Shall teach it!&#8221; Backward at the troop he glanced, <br />
That stirred impatient. But my leader knew <br />
The Power that cloaked him. <br />
&#8220;Thinkest thou thus, misled, <br />
I blundered downward for thy sport? I come <br />
Divinely messaged, where propitious fate <br />
Hath willed another through these depths to show. <br />
The greater demons at the outer gate <br />
Have learnt it. Scatheless past thy ward we go. <br />
To me the outrage of thy cries is dumb. <br />
Thy hooks are pointless.&#8221; <br />
At these words the fiend, <br />
Sore daunted, drooped his ghastly tool, and cried, <br />
&#8220;We must not strike him,&#8221; to the rest, and I, <br />
Who till this time the friending buttress screened, <br />
My guide called forward. At the word I ran <br />
Across the fearful space to reach his side, <br />
The demons crowding as I came. (I saw <br />
The footmen at Caprona once, who shrank <br />
As I did, when they looked, and rank on rank <br />
Their weaponed foes were round them, and they stood <br />
Protected only by the rules of war <br />
Against the crowd that yelled their deaths.) They would <br />
The thing they dared not, but their lust began <br />
To conquer prudence. Each the next would egg <br />
To nick me. &#8220;Score him on the rump.&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Do thou.&#8221; &#8211; <br />
&#8220;Do thou then.&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Hook him, Hellbat, by the leg.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Foultail railed against them, &#8220;Cease thee now, <br />
Scarmiglione, lest the price we pay.&#8221; <br />
And then to us, &#8211; &#8220;Ye seek a broken way. <br />
A thousand and two hundred years ago <br />
And sixty-six, it was but yesterday, <br />
And five hours later, Hell&#8217;s foundations so <br />
Were wrenched and shaken, that the bridge beyond <br />
Was flung in fragments to the chasm below. <br />
Along the margin of the boiling pond <br />
Ye needs must go some distance. There I send <br />
A swift patrol, lest any crawling wretch <br />
Beyond the pitch his blackened limbs extend. <br />
Ye may go safely in their guard. They know <br />
Too well to trick ye. Alichino here, <br />
And Calcabrina, and Cagnazzo thou, <br />
With Ciriatto of the tusks, and those <br />
Who form the ten that Barbariccia leads, <br />
Fanged Draghignazzo, Graffiacane, <br />
Hellbat, and Libicocco next, and he <br />
That deepest-hued in peculation glows, <br />
Fierce Rubicante. Oft the boiling breeds <br />
Such boldness that the sinners seek relief <br />
Along the margin, to their greater grief. <br />
Search well. But guide these twain in safety through, <br />
Along the crags that edge the boiling glue, <br />
Until ye reach the nearest cliff that stands <br />
Unbroken, and bisects the trench.&#8221; <br />
I said, <br />
&#8220;O Master, let us seek the path unled <br />
Than in such escort I Mark them glance and grin. <br />
They nudge, expectant that their sport begin <br />
When once from Foultail&#8217;s sight we pass. For me, <br />
I would not further, on a path I see <br />
More dreadful hourly.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Fear thou nought for that,&#8221; <br />
My Master answered; &#8220;thee they grin not at, <br />
But in the malice of their hope to fetch <br />
Clear of the pond and flay some crawling wretch <br />
That leaves the boiling.&#8221; <br />
By the leftward bank <br />
We then went forward in that grisly rank.</p>
<p>
Canto XXII</p>
<p>
MUCH have I seen of camps and moving men, <br />
But not that escort of the demons ten <br />
My mind compares. Not Campaldino saw <br />
Such sight uncouth; nor any rout of war, <br />
Pageant or masque, grotesque or carnival, <br />
Mummery or tilt, can aught their like recall. <br />
Nought in Italian lands, or lands afar, <br />
Nor barque by landfall steered, or leading star, <br />
Nought moves, on earth or wave or heavens of air, <br />
Like those swart fiends, our chosen escort, were. <br />
&#8220;Who wills to church must there with saints consort: <br />
Who seeks the tavern must with guzzlers sport.&#8221; <br />
So runs the proverb. With these demons we <br />
Paced the black verge that ringed the dreadful sea. <br />
Yet little heed my mind allowed to know <br />
Their various aspects vile. For seethed below <br />
That lake of pitch the where in burning heat <br />
The unclean of hand received their payment meet. <br />
Most was I bent to learn the dole they knew <br />
Whose sins their souls within that cauldron threw. <br />
As dolphins, restless of the storm to be, <br />
Arch their swift backs above the heaving sea, <br />
Whereby the seamen, peril-warned, prepare <br />
To meet fierce winds with decks and spars stripped bare, <br />
So seemed, one instant&#8217;s snatched release to gain, <br />
Some sinner twisting in that boiling pain, <br />
A shorter moment than the lightnings take, <br />
Would arch his back from out the burning lake. <br />
As wary frogs that round the stagnant ditch <br />
Show noses only, so the bubbling pitch <br />
Showed eyes of sinners, wide in watchful fright, <br />
That instant as the taloned imps they sight <br />
Sank in the slime. And as one frog may stay, <br />
While all beside have dived and slipped away, <br />
I saw (and shudder still in thought to see), <br />
How one delayed, and Graffiacani <br />
Bared his great claws, and clutched the diving head <br />
By pitchy locks, and from that burning bed <br />
Forth hauled him. So perchance yourselves have seen <br />
A fresh-speared otter from the water green <br />
Dragged, writhing. <br />
Closing round their piteous prey, <br />
&#8220;O rend him, Rubicante, rend and flay!&#8221; <br />
Cried the obscene crew. But I to Virgil then, <br />
&#8220;O Master, couldst thou of the souls of men <br />
Learn whom they seize, ere yet, their work complete, <br />
They backward fling him to the liquid heat?&#8221;</p>
<p>Close stepped my guide, at which the fiends controlled <br />
Parted and stilled, and half reluctant hold <br />
They loosed, the while he asked what sinful name <br />
Men spake on earth that there to torture came. <br />
And while the fiends their horrid trade delayed, <br />
The wretch, ere yet his quivering pelt was flayed, <br />
Gave answer. &#8220;Fathered by a waster wild, <br />
Born in Navarre, my mother sold her child, <br />
Constrained by hunger, to a lord&#8217;s employ; <br />
Then to King Thibault (yet himself a boy), <br />
My fawning service passed. By bribe and cheat <br />
I bought the lease of this unending heat.&#8221;</p>
<p>As thus constrained his trembling lips allowed <br />
The sin that cast him to that grisly crowd, <br />
Side-thrust beneath his belly&#8217;s rounded cup <br />
The tusk of Ciriatto ripped him up.</p>
<p>As some caught mouse by wicked cats at play <br />
Is tossed and toyed, he fared; but &#8220;Stand away!&#8221; <br />
Snarled Barbariccia, while his limbs he twined <br />
The victim round, and held, before, behind, <br />
Joined in one piece. &#8220;If more thou wouldst,&#8221; he said, <br />
&#8220;Ask, ere we cast him to the deathless dead!&#8221; <br />
And while the fiends forewent their labour sweet <br />
To fling his entrails to the bubbling heat, <br />
My Master asked him, &#8220;In the boiling flood <br />
What others meet ye of your country&#8217;s blood?&#8221; <br />
He answered, &#8220;One not distant far from those, <br />
A wretch Sardinian born, beside me rose <br />
Last ere they snatched me from the lake away. <br />
I would with him in scalding heat I lay <br />
From slitting tusk secure, and plunging prong!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Libicocco cried &#8220;We wait too long!&#8221; <br />
And ere his hook the chiefer fiend could stay, <br />
Mangling and tearing from the bone away <br />
The greater forepart of the arm, it fell. <br />
While Draghignazzo next, a thought more slow, <br />
Snatched downward, reaching for the legs below, <br />
And clamouring rose again those birds of Hell. <br />
But their Decurion wheeled, and loose thereat <br />
His tortured captive wrenched, and railed and spat, <br />
Cursing discordant till they stilled. <br />
Once more <br />
My Master asked him, &#8220;When they dragged ashore <br />
Your form reluctant from the burning slime <br />
Whom left ye happier?&#8221; <br />
He, some passing time, <br />
Gazed at his wound, with vacant eyes; but when <br />
Were restless motions from the demons ten, <br />
Made hurrying answer. &#8220;Friar Gomita he, <br />
That Pisa&#8217;s lord, across Sardinia&#8217;s sea, <br />
Sent, trustful, for Gallura&#8217;s rule. He made <br />
His profit ever from his trust betrayed. <br />
His lord&#8217;s worst foes the smoothing bribe could pay, <br />
And work his loss their quiet unhindered way: <br />
A pot was he where every fraud would stew; <br />
No theft was whispered but the worse he knew: <br />
No knave was he, but very king, of wrong. <br />
Michel, who sang on earth an equal song, <br />
And held the neighbouring rule, beside him lies&#8221; &#8211; <br />
But here he caught the Hell-bird&#8217;s glittering eyes <br />
Fixed on him, lustful for the hindered prey, <br />
And all his cunning mind extreme of fear <br />
Made active &#8211; &#8220;surely, would ye seek to hear <br />
Tuscan or Lombard that on earth ye knew, <br />
I need but call to bring the tortured crew. <br />
For ever, if the demon chase be slack, <br />
And one from out the scald a scourgeless back <br />
Heaves from the clinging pitch, and crawls impune <br />
Out on the marsh, with cautious signal soon <br />
He whistles to his boiling mates to try <br />
The like relief; and in such note will I <br />
So call them. Only bid the demon band <br />
Some little backward in the shades to stand, <br />
To give them heart.&#8221; <br />
His snout Cagnazzo raised, <br />
Contemptuous of the fraud, and sniffed, and gazed <br />
Derisive round. &#8220;The sinner thinks,&#8221; he said, <br />
&#8220;To plunge once more in that infernal bed, <br />
When backward in the shades we hide.&#8221; <br />
But he <br />
Whined with new guile. &#8220;I might not hope to flee <br />
Thy swifter wings. I only thought to know <br />
Those others rendered to a kindred woe, <br />
As malice moved me.&#8221; <br />
Swift Alichino <br />
Gave answer. &#8220;If the steep descent ye try <br />
We shall not trace your steps, but stooping fly <br />
Straight for the pitch, and wait you there to rend. <br />
Call whom ye will, but if ye fraud intend <br />
Dear price ye pay. &#8211; We will the slope ascend <br />
Some space, and o&#8217;er the bank&#8217;s reverse conceal <br />
Our waiting wings, the while the larger meal <br />
His malice brings us.&#8221; Thus, their mood reversed, <br />
The cheat prevailed. Cagnazzo first, who first <br />
Derided, now the offered sport would try, <br />
To draw more victims from their steaming sty.</p>
<p>The demons turned their eyes, the ridge to climb, <br />
A moment upward. Swift his chosen time <br />
The desperate sinner seized, and leapt. <br />
Aware <br />
Instant, while yet he cleft the yielding air, <br />
The broad-winged demon that had snapped the snare, <br />
Grouped his close vans, and like a falling kite <br />
Shot headlong lakeward, as a stone should smite. <br />
Yet deftly, as the sinner sank from sight, <br />
With wings outreached, and lifted breast aright <br />
Retrieved, and screaming in his rage of prey <br />
Skimmed the black gulf. <br />
But close behind his way <br />
Came Calcabrina, great of wing as he, <br />
And all his rage the baffled chase to see <br />
Against Alichino turned. New sport we saw. <br />
Demon on demon leapt, with tooth and claw <br />
Tearing. For while the prey they plunged to pluck <br />
Sank in the seething like a diving duck, <br />
The frustrate falcons flapped and clutched, and tore, <br />
Smote with wide wings, and closed and overbore <br />
Each other, turning in mid-air, and fell.</p>
<p>Were laughter here, if any depth of Hell <br />
Could hold it. Happed they on that surface hot, <br />
Their victims&#8217; torments theirs, and all forgot <br />
Their mutual rage in screaming pain. They drew <br />
Separate: they strove with desperate strength anew <br />
Their wings to lift from out the holding glue, <br />
But vainly. <br />
Fast their fellow demons flew <br />
With shrill laments above the vaporous ditch, <br />
And while they sank within the boiling pitch, <br />
From either side at Barbariccia&#8217;s call <br />
Lined banks, their mates with hooks and drags to haul <br />
To land. Still sinking as we turned away, <br />
Sprawled on the marsh, the nightmare demons lay.</p>
<p>
Canto XXIII</p>
<p>
WE did not wait that escort more, but trod <br />
A silent path in thoughtful guise, as go <br />
The Minor Friars through the streets arow, <br />
One after one, and those renounced of God, <br />
Demon and barterer, we left. <br />
I thought <br />
Of &amp;AELIG;sop&#8217;s fable of the frog that drew <br />
The mouse behind it to the drowning flood, <br />
And how that sinner in the boiling glue, <br />
Beyond design, the chasing demons brought <br />
To find a like disaster. Thought to thought <br />
As Yea to Ay were kindred. Then my blood <br />
Chilled through me as my mind advanced to see <br />
How rage might wake against us, as the cause <br />
Not only that the sinner missed their claws, <br />
But that their comrades in such snare were caught, <br />
And backward gazed I, and my guide besought, <br />
&#8220;O Master, save thou hide thyself and me <br />
Most swiftly, terror shakes my heart to see <br />
Those demons tear us, for their broken sport. <br />
Their malice, restive at our heels that ran, <br />
If rage recruit it, not their leader&#8217;s ban <br />
Nor thought of later stripes shall hold. My fear <br />
So urges that meseems the empty rear <br />
Is dark with wings that chase us.&#8221; <br />
He replied, <br />
&#8220;No leaded mirror moving at thy side <br />
More instant would return thy shape than I <br />
Receive thy thoughts unspoken. Rising nigh, <br />
The rampart is not too precipitous <br />
For careful scaling; if it falleth thus <br />
Upon the further side, we soon shall stand <br />
Beyond their peril.&#8221; <br />
Ere the ruse he planned <br />
Was action, with a whirl of wings they came <br />
Outrageous, imminent, but my guide (as she <br />
Who wakens to the roar of nearing flame, <br />
And reaches for the babe with hasty hand <br />
That life outvalues, and no more delays, <br />
Even for the covering of her shift, but forth <br />
She flies incontinent), against their wrath <br />
Upcaught me in his arms, and raced to gain <br />
The rock&#8217;s high ridge that was their boundary. <br />
And on the verge he loosed his feet, and slid <br />
The abrupt decline. <br />
As fast as down the spout <br />
The water gushes to the landmill&#8217;s wheel, <br />
So shot he down the shelving bank. The rout <br />
Of chasing demons, e&#8217;er his feet could feel <br />
The level depth, had reached the wall, hut there <br />
He feared them nothing, while they raged in vain, <br />
For high controlling Providence provides <br />
No serving demon strays beyond the sides <br />
Of that sad hollow where his task is hid.</p>
<p>Now in recovered safety looked we round. <br />
Beside us moved, with weeping eyes to ground, <br />
A people clad in golden cloaks, whereon <br />
To gaze was dazzling. Very tired and sad <br />
Their looks, and slow their steps to pass belief. <br />
And I, in doubt, who could not gauge their grief, <br />
Gazed wondering. Such depth of hoods they had, <br />
In shape as those the monks wear at Cologne; <br />
In golden brilliance like their cloaks they shone.</p>
<p>O shining sepulchre of moldering bone I <br />
For all within was lead: &#8211; such weight that those <br />
In which the second Frederick burnt his foes <br />
Were light as straw contrasted. Oh, what weight <br />
In which to barter with eternal fate I</p>
<p>Left-hand we moved along their file, but though <br />
They moved alike, they strained a pace so slow, <br />
Bent with the load they bore, that every stride <br />
A fresh face gave us that we moved beside: <br />
And still from all the gasping sohs arose. <br />
I asked my leader, &#8220;Will thy care provide <br />
When next we pass whose name or tale I know, <br />
That there we pause?&#8221; <br />
From out a backward hood <br />
There came a voice from one that understood <br />
My Tuscan speech. &#8220;If here thou list to stay, <br />
Whose feet so strangely dance the dismal way, <br />
Thy wish may wait thee.&#8221; <br />
Then I turned and saw <br />
Two shades that struggled, but the dreadful law <br />
That held them, made their haste as nought. Desire <br />
Was in their looks to reach us, and my guide <br />
Commanded: &#8220;Pause, and keep some space beside <br />
With gradual motions like their own.&#8221; <br />
We stayed <br />
Some moments patient, though three strides entire <br />
Had reached us. Noughlt they spake at first, but long <br />
With slanting eyes they summed us, and at last, <br />
Communing only to themselves, they said: <br />
&#8220;How moves his throat! Can mortal life belong <br />
To wanderers here? Or if their lives be past <br />
How walk they through this trench ungarmented?&#8221;</p>
<p>And then to me: &#8220;O Tuscan, these sad pits <br />
Form the last college of the hypocrites, <br />
And more we tell thee if thou dost not scorn <br />
To teach us of what race thyself wast born.&#8221; <br />
I answered: &#8220;I was born and nurtured nigh <br />
Where Arno finds the blue reflected sky <br />
A city&#8217;s turrets pierce. By ways forbade, <br />
Clothed with the living flesh that first I had, <br />
A High Power leads me. But yourselves shall show <br />
Why from your eyes distils this dismal woe, <br />
And what the shining pain around you clad.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nearer answered: &#8220;Jovial Friars were we. <br />
I Catalano, Loderingo he: <br />
Bologna-born, and Florence chose us twain, <br />
From either faction, jointly to maintain <br />
Her peace internal. Still thine eyes may meet, <br />
In those charred ruins of Gardingo Street, <br />
The witness what we were.&#8221; <br />
My tongue began, <br />
&#8220;O Friars, your evil &#8211; &#8221; when I marked a man <br />
Writhe on the ground. To feel their weight he lay <br />
Nailed down with three great stakes across the way.</p>
<p>Friar Catalano caught my glance, and said: <br />
&#8220;That wretch, cross-fixed, on whom in turn we tread, <br />
Is he who counselled with the priests, &#8216;For us <br />
It is expedient that one man should die -&#8217; <br />
Naked and staked to bear our burdens thus <br />
Annas alike, and all that council lie &#8211; <br />
A seed of evil for the Jews were they.&#8221; <br />
I watched my Master gaze in wonder down <br />
On that prone shade, outpulled and crucified <br />
That from their weight he might not writhe aside, <br />
Who there in everlasting exile lay, <br />
But had not suffered when he passed that way <br />
Beforetime. Nothing of his thought he said; <br />
But later to the Friar he turned: &#8220;If nought <br />
Of retribution wait thy word, I pray, <br />
Thou wilt not here deny thine aid, but say <br />
If further to the right in vain were sought <br />
Some exit from this depth, or if we need <br />
A loth return to make, and intercede <br />
With those black angels that we left.&#8221; <br />
The Friar <br />
Gave answer: &#8220;Nearer than ye think doth lie <br />
The next of those convergent cliffs that span, <br />
From the great barrier to the central pit, <br />
These depths of pain. This only arch of it <br />
Has fallen, but the slope a mortal man <br />
May clamber, for the ruins pile so high <br />
Toward the lower bank ye seek.&#8221; <br />
My guide <br />
Pondered awhile: &#8220;If this be truth, he lied <br />
Who hooks the peculators.&#8221; <br />
And the Friar <br />
Gave nimble answer: &#8220;At Bologna well <br />
We knew the devil, and all his works. A liar, <br />
And father of all lies from there to Hell, <br />
They called him.&#8221; <br />
Then with longer steps my <br />
And somewhat angered in his looks that so <br />
The imp had dared him, forward went, and I <br />
In his loved footsteps left their laden woe.</p>
<p>
Canto XXIV</p>
<p>
IN that young month of the returning year <br />
When, in Aquarius placed, the mounting <br />
Shakes loose his hair a bolder course to run, <br />
The hoarfrost takes his sister&#8217;s face of fear, <br />
A moment only. Then the husbandman, <br />
As wanes the night before the equal day, <br />
Looks forth, a world of winter-white to scan, <br />
And knows the frugal store of roots and hay <br />
Is ended, and laments, and smites his thigh, <br />
And through the house as one distraught he goes; <br />
But shortly forth again he looks, and knows <br />
The world has changed its face, and cheerily <br />
Takes crook, and chases out his flock to feed. <br />
So I, that did my Master&#8217;s anger heed, <br />
Awhile was daunted, till we came to where <br />
That tumbled ruin through the somber air <br />
Rose darkly, when he turned with smile as sweet <br />
As on that mountain when he stayed my feet <br />
At our first meeting. <br />
Careful glance he cast <br />
Along the huge mound of the broken rock, <br />
And then as one who picks his point at last, <br />
And doubts no more, from block to tumbled <br />
He led me upward, with a reaching arm, <br />
And voice that warned my blinder steps. No way <br />
Was this for those of golden cloaks to flee, <br />
That scarcely for his lighter frame, or me <br />
His arm sustained, a trembling hold supplied; <br />
And but that to the lower bank we strained <br />
(For Malebolge to the central pit <br />
Inward and downward slopes from every side), <br />
I know not if my guide the crest had gained, <br />
But sure I had not. <br />
When my feet attained <br />
The last rent fissure, the projecting stone <br />
With failing strength I grasped, and reaching it, <br />
My breath drained from me by that toil, to sit <br />
Some space I thought, but while I sank he said: <br />
&#8220;Thou must not rest thee here, but here and now <br />
Make conquest of thy sloth, for while abed, <br />
Forgetful of the hours, warm-blanketed, <br />
Men rest, or sitting loose at ease, they find <br />
No fame, but life consumes, they watch not how; <br />
As foam on water, or as smoke in air, <br />
A moment passes, and it is not there. <br />
Arise! and with thy spirit&#8217;s strength contend <br />
Against the flesh that drags thee. Thus shall end <br />
Revolt, except the ignoble soul allow <br />
The body&#8217;s weight to sink it. Not enough <br />
Is wrought that thus the deeper trench we quit. <br />
Be thine to comprehend, and with the wit <br />
The will for action.&#8221; <br />
Narrow, steep and rough, <br />
Yet rose the path across the ridge that led, <br />
But shamed to hear my leader&#8217;s words I feigned <br />
A strength I had not. &#8220;In thy steps,&#8221; I said, <br />
&#8220;I follow, confident,&#8221; and further speech <br />
I made, the while the rampart&#8217;s crest we gained, <br />
To hide my faintness from myself. Thereat <br />
A voice made answer from the further deep, <br />
Bestial, and formless of clear words to reach <br />
The hearer&#8217;s mind, but not this loss forgat <br />
The notes of wrath. <br />
Above the further steep <br />
Now stood we, but my living sight was vain <br />
To pierce the blackness whence that awful cry <br />
Reproached me. <br />
&#8220;Master, while we here remain. <br />
I hear, but nought it means, and nought I see <br />
Down-gazing. Wilt thou that the further wall <br />
We gain, and climbing by the shorter fall, <br />
Perchance in safety our descents repeat?&#8221;</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;For fit request a fit reply <br />
Is action only.&#8221; Leading silently, <br />
He crossed the bridge, and on the eighth surround <br />
A vantage of sufficient sight I found <br />
That showed the seventh and more dreadful woe <br />
Than those behind. For serpents here I saw <br />
Hideous and frightful in their throngs, as though <br />
All Libya and the red Egyptian sea <br />
Had swarmed them. While I write my heart at war <br />
With recollection backward holds my blood, <br />
Shuddering. For not the Libyan sands shall be, <br />
Nor all the plagues of the Egyptian flood, <br />
Nor all that Ethiopia spawns, alike <br />
Prolific. Not the crested water-snake, <br />
The cobra, nor the leaping jaculus, <br />
The speckled death, the serpent formed to strike <br />
From either end, such horror holds. <br />
I saw <br />
A people naked, with no hole to take <br />
For refuge, blindly in their fear that ran <br />
Amidst this ruthless and appalling throng. <br />
O for the spotted heliotrope I that thus <br />
They might escape unseen. But not this law <br />
Could charms resist. To snakes their hands belong <br />
Snakes through their loins are pierced. I watched a man <br />
Against whose throat a sudden serpent bit, <br />
More swiftly than the shortest word is writ <br />
Take fire, and burn, and in his place there came <br />
A little heap of ashes. As the flame <br />
In cinders sank, a sight most marvellous <br />
Was mine &#8211; the calcined heap reversed the wrong, <br />
Arising to its human form. &#8216;Tis said <br />
The Phoenix thus, on tears of incense fed, <br />
That eats no herb, or any coarser bread, <br />
With each five hundred years is purified, <br />
And rises thence as though it had not died, <br />
From its own ash again incarnated.</p>
<p>But as some demon-haunted soul may fall <br />
Unconscious, writhing, nor the fit recall, <br />
But weak and pallid to his feet again <br />
He struggles dumbly in bewildered pain, <br />
So looked the sinner. What scale of Heaven was here <br />
To weight a doom so dreadful, so severe?</p>
<p>&#8220;Who art thou?&#8221; asked my guide, and answered he: <br />
&#8220;A short while since I rained from Tuscany <br />
To this ferocious gutter. A life more beast <br />
Than human pleased me there. Pistoia well <br />
My savage carnal ways, till here I fell, <br />
Denned, native, Vanni Fucci, mule, am I.&#8221;</p>
<p>I answered: &#8220;Though thy bestial crimes to hell <br />
Have flung thee rightly, yet I rede not well <br />
Why to this lower depth thou cam&#8217;st?&#8221; <br />
And he <br />
Feigned not to hear, but in a dismal shame <br />
Gazed blankly upward, till constrained he said, <br />
&#8220;Not for those crimes of loud repute I came <br />
To this relentless doom. Reluctfully <br />
It wrenches all my heart with grief to say <br />
My guilt &#8211; more bitter than when first the dead <br />
I joined, and Minos cast me here. My sin <br />
Was this, that having robbed the sacristry <br />
I spake not, while Rampino tortured lay, <br />
And della Nona died, a guilt to pay <br />
Which was not theirs. For that false crime herein <br />
The serpents take me at their lust &#8211; but thou <br />
Shalt go not backward with light heart to tell <br />
My townsmen of this hidden infamy, <br />
Nor joy to watch me in this pass &#8211; I see <br />
A thing that cometh on earth. Short year from now <br />
Thy part shall from my native place expel <br />
The Neri, and their wealth shall confiscate. <br />
But then shall Florence cleanse her lawless state; <br />
Thy faction, outcast from her palaces, <br />
Shall suffer all they gave, till Mars shall bring <br />
A flaming vapour of such fierce disease <br />
From Val di Magra, that the trembling knees <br />
Of each Bianco on Piceno&#8217;s plain <br />
Shall bleeding bow. I would not tell this thing <br />
Could any prescience on thy part restrain <br />
The sorrow for thee which my heart foresees.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Canto XXV</p>
<p>
HIS words he ended, and his bestial mind <br />
Reverted to its impious use. He raised <br />
Both hands in gestures of obscenity <br />
Against the Eternal, till my heart inclined <br />
To bless the serpents. One, that leapt behind <br />
Just as he shouted, &#8220;Take it, God! at Thee <br />
I aim it,&#8221; twisted round his throat, to bind <br />
His further utterance. One, his arms about, <br />
Its tightening knots o&#8217;er wrists and elbows twined <br />
To cease his antics. Ah, Pistoia! why <br />
Dost never, when thy bitter factions burn <br />
Their foemen&#8217;s houses, and are sacked in turn, <br />
The whole send upward to the cleansing sky <br />
In one consuming? since thy sons exceed <br />
The first corruptions of the godless seed <br />
That built thee. All the infernal depths I trod <br />
Revealed no shade with such contempt for God.</p>
<p>But while we looked, with sudden haste he fled, <br />
And past us raced a Centaur-shape who said, <br />
&#8220;Where hides the snarling thief I seek?&#8221; <br />
I know <br />
Maremma, nor believe its fens could show <br />
So numerous snakes as round his haunches hung <br />
And twisted in their wrath, and thereamong, <br />
Even to the human part, behind his head <br />
A fiery dragon broods with wings outspread, <br />
That burn, and render all they reach to flame.</p>
<p>Then said my Master, &#8220;Cacus here we see, <br />
Who made of old beneath Mount Aventine <br />
Beneath his brethren, for the theft of shame <br />
A lake of blood. To this great depth he came, <br />
That there he wrought. He ceased his perfidy, <br />
Taught by the raining blows of Hercules, &#8211; <br />
A hundred mashed him, though he felt but ten.&#8221;</p>
<p>On rushed the Centaur in his haste to seize <br />
The fleeing shade, and while we gazed ahead <br />
We saw not that beneath there came three men <br />
That watched us, till they cried, &#8220;Who are ye there?&#8221; <br />
Whereat the Centaur left our thoughts, and these <br />
Possessed them. One man to his neighbour said, <br />
&#8220;Why tarries Cianfa?&#8221; By that word aware <br />
Of those that faced me, to my guide I signed <br />
Desire for silence. <br />
Reader, if this tale <br />
Thy mind reject, I blame thee nought, for I <br />
Look back, and memory here and credence find <br />
Dispute. A monster with a serpent&#8217;s tail, <br />
And with six feet along the ground that ran, <br />
Made halt before the three, and picked a man, <br />
And leapt upon him. No clinging ivies twine <br />
So closely. In his face its teeth it set. <br />
Its forward feet behind his shoulders met. <br />
Its belly on his belly pressed. Its feet <br />
Strained to his sides and thighs, to backward meet. <br />
Its tail between his legs, along his spine <br />
Curled upwards. As a lighted paper burns <br />
And blackens, but at first to brown it turns <br />
Before the flames have reached it, so did they <br />
Transform and blend, until you might not say <br />
The serpent-hue was that, or this was man, <br />
And then, as melted wax, their forms began <br />
To merge and mingle. Cried his comrades, &#8220;Lo, <br />
Where art &#8211; what art &#8211; which art thou, Agnello? <br />
Art both or neither?&#8221; The two heads by now <br />
Were one. The bodies were a monstrous sight. <br />
A man was snake: a reptile walked upright. <br />
With dragging steps it left us. <br />
Hast thou seen <br />
The lizards changing hedge? From side to side <br />
They cross the sun-glare of the roadway wide <br />
A baffling streak. So fast a reptile shot <br />
Toward these two remaining. Smoking hot, <br />
And black as peppercorn it showed. It leapt <br />
And pierced the navel of the one. It stept <br />
Some paces back, and crouched, and watched. Its eyes <br />
Its victim held, and he with dull surprise <br />
Yawning, as one by sleep or fever dazed, <br />
No motion made to fly, but backward gazed <br />
Tranced. From the reptile&#8217;s mouth, the navel&#8217;s hole, <br />
There came two smokes that feeling through the air <br />
Were joined. The serpent and the human soul <br />
In this conjunction stayed. Let Lucan prate <br />
No more the horror of Nasidius&#8217; fate, <br />
Nor how Sabellus failed from sight. I bear <br />
No envy to the tales that Ovid made <br />
Of Cadmus to a serpent changed, or how <br />
Sad Arethusa is a fountain now. <br />
They did not dream the thing I saw. The shade <br />
That once was man his dreadful doom obeyed. <br />
He closed his feet. His legs and thighs as one <br />
Were blended. All that to his form was done <br />
The snake reversed. Its tail it cleft. The skin <br />
On the divided parts I saw begin <br />
To shed its scales and soften; while the man <br />
Acquiring that the snake had lost, began <br />
lo alter snakelike his retractile limb. <br />
Lengthened the worm&#8217;s short arms: the arms of him <br />
Shortened and scaled. The man&#8217;s fifth member then <br />
Lengthened and slit, the worm&#8217;s hind legs to match. <br />
The worm&#8217;s hind legs their shrinking claws attach, <br />
And blend to form the part concealed of men.</p>
<p>The copulating smoke around them spread. <br />
The man grew bald. The needed hair was bred <br />
Upon the snake&#8217;s transforming parts. His head <br />
The foul beast lifted, and arose upright. <br />
The man fell prostrate. But the thievish light <br />
Still kindled in their baleful eyes, the while <br />
Their faces altered, and the shape erect, <br />
- For which was human? &#8211; their completed guile <br />
In altered visage showed. Its jaws withdrew. <br />
A nose and lips it formed, and ears outgrew. <br />
The while that other on the ground that lay, <br />
Forked its thin tongue, and turned, and crawled away. <br />
And like a snail that hides its horns, I saw <br />
The ears receding in the serpent head. <br />
Loud hissing down the dismal trench it sped, <br />
And after ran the worm transformed, and tried <br />
A sputtering speech. <br />
But scarce my mind could think <br />
Clear thought, or eyes see clearly, while the law <br />
That ruled the refuse of this hateful sink <br />
Changed and rechanged them. Yet I marked the last <br />
Of those three shades, that slyly shrank aside, <br />
Desirous only from my glance to hide, &#8211; <br />
Puccio Sciancato. Him the serpents passed <br />
Without molesting while I stayed. The one <br />
I saw transformed was he for whom Gaville <br />
Yet wails the vengeance that it cowered to feel, <br />
Because his murder in its streets was done.</p>
<p>
Canto XXVI</p>
<p>
REJOICE, my Florence I that thy lifted wings <br />
Not only in the world&#8217;s wide sunlight shine, <br />
Not only o&#8217;er the waves of ocean beat; <br />
In Hell&#8217;s deep vaults an equal fame is thine. <br />
Five thieves, &#8211; and every thief a Florentine! <br />
So thought I grimly, as we turned to meet <br />
The cliff&#8217;s ascent. But if the morning brings <br />
The mind God&#8217;s counsel, if its dreams be true, <br />
Then that dark end desired of Prato&#8217;s hate, <br />
And all thy sullen, greedful foes, for you <br />
Comes quickly. Not that were today the date <br />
It were too soon for those who love thee. Yea, <br />
I would that that which cometh came today. <br />
For grief that on my weaker age shall weigh <br />
Were now less dreadful. <br />
Rough the rising stair <br />
That hard we clomb with foot and hand and knee, <br />
And very silent all, and lonely there, <br />
The ridge we crossed a keener grief to see. <br />
Grief were it to gaze, and still that grief to me <br />
Comes sharply, as my thoughts reluctant draw <br />
Their wells of memory for the thing I saw. <br />
With pain I speak, for if the holier law <br />
Myself I hold, by any kindly star, <br />
Or Power supernal, guided safely through <br />
The world&#8217;s stretched snares, I would not boast nor tell <br />
As one who triumphs, that these depths of Hell <br />
Contain such fruitage of our kind. <br />
The view <br />
Beneath us was an empty depth, wherethrough <br />
Lights moved, abundant as the fireflies are <br />
At even, when the gnats succeed the flies. <br />
A myriad gleams the labourer sees who lies <br />
Above them, resting, while the vale below <br />
Already darkens to the night, &#8211; he toiled <br />
From dawn to store the ripened grapes, or till <br />
The roots around, and on the shadowing hill <br />
Reclines and gazes down the vale. As he, <br />
Whose mockers felt the she-bears&#8217; teeth, beheld <br />
The chariot-horses rise erect to reach <br />
The heavens of air, with searching eyes could see <br />
At last, a little climbing flame afar, <br />
That faded, cloudlike, as the fiery car <br />
Ascended past his mortal sight, so here <br />
Along the gutter of the fosse there came, <br />
And passed, and left us, many a roving flame, <br />
That seemed flame only, yet a human soul <br />
Held each, but hid from sight the thief it stole.</p>
<p>This marvel of the moving flames to see, <br />
I stretched from off the bridge so eagerly <br />
I slipped, and falling grasped a rocky spar, <br />
Alone that saved me from that depth. My guide <br />
The answer to my eager search supplied. <br />
&#8220;Within those moving flames the tortured are. <br />
Each in his garment wraps himself from sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Master, a truth already guessed aright <br />
Thy word makes surer. Much I long to know <br />
What spirit swathed in that wide fire doth go, <br />
That flickers upward in two flames, as though <br />
It rose combined from that reluctant pyre <br />
Where, with his brother, burnt Eteocles, <br />
To form two pillars of divided fire, <br />
Because no death could quench their enmities?&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered, &#8220;Twain are in that flame; they run <br />
Together now because they sinned as one. <br />
Ulysses tortured there, and Diomed, <br />
Repent the treason of the horse, that led <br />
To Rome&#8217;s foundation &#8211; through the fated door <br />
The exiles issuing; and the trick lament <br />
Through which still weeps in death Deidamia <br />
For her lost Achilles; and furthermore <br />
They suffer for the thieved Palladium.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Master,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;if they be not dumb <br />
With so much anguish, let them speak, I pray, <br />
- A thousand prayers I pray thee! &#8211; Grant we stay <br />
Till that horned flame come hither! You see me bend <br />
Almost to falling with desire.&#8221; <br />
He said: <br />
&#8220;Thy prayer is praise to him that prays it. Yea; <br />
I grant; but hearken. When they pass below <br />
Keep silent. Thee they might disdain, but I <br />
Will ask thy purpose.&#8221; <br />
When they came more nigh, <br />
He hailed them. &#8220;Ye who from one fire ascend <br />
A twofold flame, I charge ye, if ye owe <br />
A quittance to me for the lofty lay <br />
Wherein I praised your earthly fames, I pray <br />
That here ye pause, the while that one shall say <br />
Of where at last he wandered forth to die.&#8221; <br />
At this was shaking of the greater horn, <br />
And murmurs not at first articulate, &#8211; <br />
A flame that by the wind is trailed and torn <br />
To flickers, &#8211; till the end made animate <br />
Wagged like a tongue, and answered, &#8211; <br />
&#8220;When I turned <br />
Aside from Circe&#8217;s later lure, and left <br />
The mount that &amp;AELIG;neas named, my heart forgot <br />
My aged father, I regarded not <br />
My fondness for my child, my wife bereft <br />
Of her due rights of love, but through my heart <br />
Again the unconquerable ardour burned <br />
To search experience of the world, anew <br />
The vice and valour of mankind to view, <br />
And seek the events of lonely lands apart <br />
From known adventures of my race. I chose <br />
One ship, and with a little band of those <br />
With heart to follow, steered for open sea, <br />
And left behind the morning. <br />
Either shore, <br />
Spain and Morocco saw we, and between <br />
Sardinia and the isles. At length was seen <br />
That narrow passage of the meeting seas, <br />
Whereat the warning stands of Hercules <br />
That no man dare to pass it. Old were we, <br />
Myself and my companions, old and slow, <br />
When Ceuta lay behind us, and Seville <br />
Was fading on the right, and westward still <br />
We pointed. <br />
&#8220;Brothers,&#8221; to the rest I said, <br />
&#8220;O brothers, following where my star hath led, <br />
That not a thousand shapes of pain could dread <br />
From this so great adventure. Hear me now. <br />
Deny not that we add to all our gains, <br />
While the brief vigil hour of life remains, <br />
Experience of the unpeopled world that lies <br />
Behind the lights of sunset. Think ye now, <br />
We are not fashioned as the brute that dies, <br />
But born for virtue and exploit.&#8221; <br />
Thereat <br />
Such ardour waked that had I sought to stay <br />
I scarce had ruled them. Still the moving poop <br />
Looked back, and left the dawn. A southward loop <br />
We sailed, still bending to the left, the while <br />
We laboured weakly at the oars, and mile <br />
To foolish mile extended, till we moved <br />
Beneath strange stars in unacquainted skies. <br />
Five times the bright bowl of the moon had filled, <br />
Five times through heaven its silver light had spilled, <br />
When as we toiled that silent waste of way, <br />
A mountain, drear and vast, in distance lay. <br />
A mountain of such height and magnitude <br />
As all my wandering life I had not viewed: <br />
But short was our rejoicing. From the land <br />
A tempest smote us. Thrice the beaten prow <br />
Whirled round with all its waters: either hand <br />
The rising waves assailed our decks, and now <br />
The bows tossed upwards, now the poop, for He <br />
At last had spoken. Overwhelmed were we; <br />
And closed again the solitary sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Canto XXVII</p>
<p>
THE flame was silent, and erect and still <br />
Moved from us with my leader&#8217;s leave. <br />
There came <br />
Behind another and more restless flame <br />
That strove for speech, and found its thwarted will <br />
Gave only noise of whistling sounds, until <br />
The words worked upward through the fire, as erst <br />
The tyrant heard the brass Sicilian bull, &#8211; <br />
That justly for its roasting victim first <br />
He filled with its designer, &#8211; turn his cries <br />
To bull-like bellowing. So the cunning file <br />
Had tuned its throat. <br />
But now the call he tries, <br />
Vibrating upward to the tongue&#8217;s intent, <br />
Sounds clearer. &#8220;Thou &#8211; O dear and wonderful! &#8211; <br />
Who bringest that loved speech of Lombardy, <br />
Thou whose familiar words to him that went, <br />
&#8216;Go now, I urge no further,&#8217; called me on, <br />
Though late, to plead thy patience. Pause, I pray, <br />
Some longer space. Although so wrapt, to me <br />
It irks not if I hear thee. This blind way <br />
We burn, but may not lighted, if ye fell <br />
But lately from the Latian land, from where <br />
The endless burden of my guilt I bear, <br />
If peace is on Romagna, wilt thou tell? <br />
For I was native of the mountains there <br />
Between Urbino and the heights from whence <br />
The Tiber rises.&#8221; <br />
Still I downward bent, <br />
And leant far outward in my eagerness, <br />
Whereat my Leader, from my fixed intent <br />
To call me, touched me on the side, and said, <br />
&#8220;Speak thou, &#8211; is here no Greek&#8217;s impertinence <br />
To scorn thee.&#8221; <br />
I thereat, who willed no less, <br />
Spake swiftly, &#8220;O sad spirit, so garmented <br />
In flame no glance can reach thee, still thy land <br />
Hath tyrants, in their hearts devising war, <br />
But nought of open strife I lately saw, <br />
And still within its ancient walls doth stand <br />
The strength of thy Ravenna. Still doth brood <br />
Polenta&#8217;s eagle, and his pinions spread <br />
Above its roofs, and Cervia&#8217;s. Forli now, <br />
Its siege and slaughter of its foes forgot, <br />
The Green Claws hold anew. Verrucchio <br />
Hath still its mastiff, and his young, who show <br />
The teeth that tore Montagna. Still doth plot <br />
The little lion in his lair of snow <br />
To friend both factions, and his rule admit <br />
Lamone&#8217;s and Santerno&#8217;s towns. That one <br />
Constricted in its narrow space that lies <br />
Between the mountains and the Savio, <br />
So between tyrant rule and freedom won <br />
Alternates. As I answer all, for it <br />
Requite me. Tell me, as I half surmise, <br />
Who wast thou? Tell me all thy tale, that so <br />
Thy name on earth shall stablish.&#8221; <br />
Then the flame <br />
Roared without speech awhile, but in the end <br />
The flickering point gave utterance. &#8220;If ye came <br />
To count our tortures, and to earth ascend <br />
To tell them, nothing would ye hear from me, <br />
For all your pleading. But I know too well <br />
There is no issue from this depth of Hell <br />
For those who enter. With no fear of shame <br />
I tell thee. By the sword I lived. Amend <br />
To Heaven I schemed, and took St. Francis&#8217; cord <br />
Not vainly, and my hope had fruited well, <br />
But evil take the false Pope Boniface! <br />
Who led me to my earlier sins. The sword <br />
I lived by, but my deeds from infancy <br />
The fox&#8217;s wiles and shifts and secret shame <br />
Had practised, till my cunning crafts became <br />
A byword through the earth for perfidy. <br />
When to the age I came at which mankind <br />
Should turn the haven of the soul to find <br />
From voyaging on life&#8217;s alluring sea, <br />
Drop sails and wind their idle ropes, and so <br />
Pass inward on the tide with steerage slow, <br />
Then was I grieved for all my boast before, <br />
And with repentance wept, &#8211; alas, the woe! <br />
It might have saved me. <br />
Through this cord I wore <br />
I served the Chief Priest of the Pharisees, <br />
Who warred, &#8211; but not with Jews, and not with those <br />
Who conquered Acre. Nor his Christian foes <br />
Were merchants in the Soldan&#8217;s land who dwelt, <br />
But in the precincts of the Lateran <br />
Christ&#8217;s priest the Christian who beside him dwelt <br />
Distressed with violence. Not his vows, nor dread <br />
Of his high office as the Church&#8217;s Head, <br />
Nor reverence for my cord, that used to make <br />
The wearers leaner, stayed him. Constantine <br />
So called Silvestro from Soracte&#8217;s cave <br />
To cure him leprous, as this godless man <br />
Besought my counsel. As a fool may rave <br />
In drunken pride I thought him. Word of mine <br />
He got not to inspire his guilt. At last <br />
He urged me, &#8216;Doubt not that thy choice be cast <br />
With wisdom, if thou do the thing I bid. <br />
I do absolve and bless thee even now <br />
Before the words have passed thy lips. Do thou <br />
Contrive that I shall gain Penestrino. <br />
Forget not I can open or forbid <br />
The Eternal Gate. The Keys that Celestine <br />
So lightly loosed are twain. <br />
Alike of Heaven and Hell.&#8217; <br />
He urged me thus <br />
Till speech than silence seemed less dangerous, <br />
Whereon I answered, &#8216;Father, since my guilt <br />
Thou cleanest ere I tell thee. If thou wilt, <br />
In one way canst thou triumph &#8211; all they will <br />
In solemn treaty seal, &#8211; and nought fulfil.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I died, and to St. Francis&#8217; care consigned <br />
My parting spirit, but there came behind <br />
A shape that seized me by the hair, and cried <br />
Against my Patron, &#8216;Make no claim for him. <br />
&#8216;Tis he who gave the counsel fraudulent. <br />
I have not left him since. Can man repent <br />
The while he sins? The contradiction here <br />
Defies thy rescue, and the guilt is clear.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I turned, and one of Hell&#8217;s Black Cherubim <br />
Leered back. &#8216;Thou didst not think with all thy craft <br />
I studied logic in the schools?&#8217; he laughed. <br />
He bore me down to Minos&#8217; seat, and he <br />
Eight times his tail around his fearful back <br />
Entwined, and gnawed it in his rage, and said <br />
&#8216;Is here a sinner for the depths,&#8217; and me <br />
He bade them fling to where I should not lack <br />
My like, &#8216;Down-cast him to the thievish fire <br />
That hides its victims in its fold,&#8217; and so <br />
For ever in this robe of pain I go; <br />
My craft, that to my safe repentance led, <br />
- That craft betrayed me to a fate so dire.&#8221;</p>
<p>We left him wailing, and the writhing flame <br />
Tossed its sharp horn for further speech, but we <br />
No longer paused, but upward climbed, and came <br />
To that next arch which spans a baser woe. <br />
For suffering here were those who wrought to sow <br />
Dissension &#8211; guilt the fruit, and here the fee.</p>
<p>
Canto XXVIII</p>
<p>
WHO in free words, without restraint or bar <br />
Of formal beauty in their choice, could say <br />
The things I saw? Repeat a different way <br />
A hundred times, and what those tortures are <br />
It tells not. Words are lacked. The mind of man <br />
Such horror hates. It shrinks to comprehend <br />
Such slaughterous sights as here around us ran.</p>
<p>If all who in Apulia&#8217;s fatal land <br />
Bewailed the bloodshed of their violent end <br />
Beneath the merciless Roman sword, &#8211; if they <br />
Who died in that long Punic war, which gave <br />
Even of the rings they wore so vast a prey, &#8211; <br />
If those who felt the weight of Guiscard&#8217;s glaive, &#8211; <br />
With those who perished in the fatal band <br />
The false Apulians to their fate betrayed, <br />
Whose bones at Ceperano heap, &#8211; with all <br />
Alardo&#8217;s craft at Tagliacozzo made <br />
Without resort of weaponed strife to fall, &#8211; <br />
Were gathered in one place and each displayed <br />
The shredded limbs, the ghastly wounds of war, <br />
Nought were it to the dreadful mode I saw <br />
In this ninth chasm. <br />
A man beneath us stood <br />
Whose body like a cantless cask was split. <br />
The staves bulge outward. Through the bursting wood <br />
It pours its contents. So the open slit <br />
That cleft him, fore and hind, from neck to thigh, <br />
Poured out; between his legs his entrails hung. <br />
He thrust his hands his heart and lungs among, <br />
And cried against us, &#8220;See Mahomet&#8217;s pride! <br />
Or see where Ali weeping walks beside, <br />
Cleft down the face in twain from hair to chin. <br />
Scandal or schism has each man sown as I. <br />
For discord are we sliced who walk herein. <br />
A devil waits us in our turn. For while <br />
We stumble in our wounds, with every mile <br />
The torment heals us, till again we reach <br />
The place we were, and with his sword to each <br />
He gives the slitting which we felt before. &#8211; <br />
But who are ye who with no falling gore <br />
So calmly view us? Do ye seek delay <br />
To shun the purpose of the guilty way?&#8221; <br />
My Master answered, &#8220;Death he hath not known, <br />
Nor guilt unpurged the downward path hath shown <br />
To whom I lead, but full experience <br />
To gain, he goeth through evil&#8217;s last defence <br />
From cycle down to cycle: this is true <br />
As here I stand and speak, who like to you <br />
Have all my deeds behind me.&#8221; <br />
At this word <br />
Such wonder stirred the trench, that those who heard <br />
A moment of their torment lost, and stayed <br />
Oblivious of their gaping wounds. I made <br />
The count of twice a hundred. <br />
&#8220;Thou canst tell <br />
Dolcino, if his waiting place in hell <br />
He hath no haste for, that the Novarese <br />
May win by starving whom they may not seize <br />
By any sword-craft. Let him arm him well <br />
With store of victuals ere the snow make blind <br />
The mountain ways.&#8221; <br />
So spake Mahomet, the while <br />
He stood with one leg lifted, to beguile <br />
The demon that he moved. <br />
A shade behind, <br />
Noseless, with one ear only, and his throat <br />
Slit open, through the red gash spake, &#8220;O thou! <br />
Guiltless, who on the Latian ground ere now <br />
Hast met me, save resemblance lead astray, <br />
Remember Piero, if the backward way, <br />
To reach the sunlight of the world, thy fate <br />
Permit thee, if thy living feet regain <br />
Mine own dear country where the gentle plain <br />
Slopes downward to Vercelli, wilt thou tell <br />
The noblest two in Fano&#8217;s walls that dwell, <br />
Cassero and Cagnano, that except <br />
Our foresight fail us here, that lord adept <br />
At violence and unfaith shall both betray, <br />
Cast from their barque in Cattolica bay, <br />
Sack-sewn and weighted? He that hath one eye, <br />
And holds that land that one who here doth lie <br />
Had better never in his life have seen, <br />
Will bring them there to treaty, and thereby <br />
So act that caution of Fecara&#8217;s squalls <br />
Will aid them nought. Such deed there hath not been <br />
In Neptune&#8217;s sight: he hath more hope who falls <br />
To Argives or to pirates.&#8221; <br />
I replied, <br />
&#8220;Your speech resists me. Show me first aright <br />
Who with thee here laments that bitter sight, <br />
That I may bear thy tale aloft.&#8221; <br />
He gripped <br />
A comrade by the jaw. &#8220;This shade dumb-lipped <br />
Was Curio once, with wagging tongue that lied <br />
To cease the doubt in C&aelig;sar. &#8216;All delay <br />
To men prepared is harmful!&#8217; urged he then. <br />
Now walks he round to reach the place again <br />
Where waits the slaughtering demon.&#8221; <br />
Sick dismay <br />
Was on the face that once so glibly spake, <br />
And tongue slit backward to the throat I saw <br />
That once had gibed the dreadful cast of war. <br />
Now moved he on, his endless turn to take <br />
Prepared for that which did not grant delay. <br />
But one whose either hand was sliced away, <br />
Raised in the dusk the bleeding stumps until <br />
The blood fell backward on his face, and cried <br />
&#8220;Forget not Mosca! &#8216;Ere ye counsel, kill; <br />
Death&#8217;s logic brief will save long argument. <br />
The wrought deed prospers!&#8217; &#8211; So I urged. Ah me! <br />
It bore a bitter seed for Tuscany.&#8221;</p>
<p>I answered curtly, &#8220;And your race has died.&#8221; <br />
Whereat as one distraught with pain he went <br />
Lamenting doubly. <br />
Still I watched beside <br />
The moving troops, and here a thing I saw <br />
Divorced from reason. All our natural law <br />
Denies it. Only mine integrity <br />
To write such proofless words gives confidence. <br />
But this I saw, and still in mind I see, &#8211; <br />
A headless trunk that walked. Beside his knee <br />
He swung his own head by the hair, as though <br />
He bore a lantern for his feet to go <br />
Unstumbling in the darkness. No pretence <br />
Of explanation mine. What God ordains <br />
The wise man marvels, and the fool explains. <br />
The sharp eyes marked us, and a startled O! <br />
Broke from the lips, and when the trunk below <br />
Came level where we paused, the arm on high <br />
Lifted the head to bring its words more nigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou living, who dost view the grievous dead, <br />
Is any doom so great as mine,&#8221; it said, <br />
&#8220;In all Hell&#8217;s circles? That De Born am I <br />
Who gave my prince the evil counselling <br />
Which caused him, rebel to the elder king, <br />
Against his sire to war. Ahithophel <br />
So worked with David and with Absalom. <br />
Because I parted father and child, in Hell <br />
My root of being finds the brain therefrom <br />
Disparted. So the Eternal Justice wills.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Canto XXIX</p>
<p>
THE numerous people, and the diverse ills <br />
That slit them in a hundred forms, had made <br />
Mine eyes so salted, that awhile I stayed <br />
Content with weeping, till my wiser guide <br />
Reproached me. &#8220;Wherefore is thy sight delayed <br />
Amidst the dismal demon-hacked so long? <br />
Thou didst not linger at superior wrong <br />
In higher pits so fainly. Wouldst thou guess <br />
The numbers whom discordant wounds distress, <br />
Consider two and twenty miles complete <br />
The narrowing circuit that we cross. But now <br />
The moon has passed beneath us. Short allow <br />
Remains, before the time conceded ends, <br />
And far beyond this gloom the realm extends <br />
That waits thee.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Master,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;if thou <br />
Hadst heeded that which drew my gaze, thy feet <br />
Had stayed beside me.&#8221; But he pressed ahead <br />
The while I answered, that the words I said <br />
Were called behind him as we moved. <br />
&#8220;Within <br />
That cavern where I gazed so fixed, I saw <br />
A kinsman who bewailed the dreadful law <br />
That prices in such coin his earthly sin.&#8221;</p>
<p>My Master answered, &#8220;Waste no thought thereon, <br />
Mine eyes observed him whilst thine own were set <br />
Too firmly on De Born to heed. He made <br />
A gesture fierce with hate. They called him here <br />
Geri del Bello.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;O my Guide! the debt <br />
He left of honour, which his partners yet, <br />
Who shared his shame, have venged not, so betrayed <br />
His heart to indignation. More for that <br />
My pity meets him.&#8221; <br />
While we spake, he led <br />
Across the ridgeway to the final tier <br />
Of ordered suffering. Far beneath us spread, <br />
Hid only by the dimness, wide and Hat, <br />
The last sad cloister of the damned. <br />
If sight <br />
Came slowly in the gloom, it did not hide <br />
The sounds of their lamenting. Every cry <br />
Was like a shaft that pierced me, fledged for flight <br />
With pity. Thousand were the woes that cried <br />
In different accents, till my hands I pressed <br />
Against my ears to still them. <br />
If the ills <br />
Of Valdichiana, when the autumn fills <br />
Its lazars, with Maremma&#8217;s sick should lie, <br />
And all Sardinia&#8217;s in one ditch, so high, <br />
So foul, the putrid stench might reach. <br />
We left <br />
The last span of the bridge&#8217;s long descent <br />
To take the intersecting wall. We went <br />
Left-hand, as always. As we climbed more low <br />
The thick malignant air sufficed to show <br />
How the infallible Justice of God contrives <br />
The doom of those who use their earthly lives <br />
To give the face of truth to falsity.</p>
<p>I think not that &amp;AELIG;gina&#8217;s ancient woe <br />
More bitter evil in its course could show, <br />
Though groaning in an air so pestilent <br />
All creatures, even the fluttering insect, fell, <br />
Till all of human kind, as sages tell, <br />
Had perished, once again to multiply <br />
From seeds of ants. <br />
Along a trench we went <br />
Where spirits in disordered heaps were thrown <br />
And languished. This upon the belly lay, <br />
That on the back, of him beneath. Alone <br />
Another wriggled down the dismal way.</p>
<p>We went in silence, watching men too sick <br />
To lift their bodies as we came, and heard <br />
Their plaints unceasing. Two there were that leant <br />
Against each other, as two pans are propt <br />
For warming, on the hearth; and each so thick <br />
Was scabbed, that horse-boy never yet so quick <br />
Plied comb the while his master called, as they <br />
Scraped with their nails the itching scales away, <br />
That like the scales of bream around them dropt, <br />
When the knife cleans it. <br />
To the first his word <br />
My guide addressed. &#8220;O thou whose nails so fast <br />
Now shred thy mail, and now as pincers work, <br />
If any Latians in this trench are cast <br />
I pray thee tell, and may thy fingers last <br />
Sufficient for thy needs eternally!&#8221; <br />
The leper answered, &#8220;Latians both are we <br />
Who weep this torment. Tell me whom I see <br />
That so can walk untortured?&#8221; <br />
He replied, <br />
&#8220;One am I that High Heaven hath sent to guide <br />
This other through the trenches ploughed in Hell.</p>
<p>At that they raised themselves apart, and turned <br />
To gaze upon me. Others near, who learned <br />
The meaning of my Master&#8217;s words, alike <br />
Their trembling bodies lifted up to see.</p>
<p>My leader&#8217;s kindness gave the speech to me, &#8211; <br />
&#8220;Ask that thou wilt,&#8221; and by this leave I said, <br />
&#8220;So that thy memory may not steal away <br />
From our first world for many suns to be, <br />
Let not disgust at thy sin&#8217;s penalty <br />
Restrain thee from the telling.&#8221; <br />
He replied, <br />
&#8220;I was Arezzo-born, and burned alive <br />
(Albero da Siena&#8217;s false contrive <br />
Condemned me); not for that for which I died <br />
Ye see me here. There is no doubt I said, <br />
Too lightly, man could raise himself in flight <br />
By arts I knew, and in his foolishness <br />
He willed that I should teach him. This I tried, <br />
And failed, whereon the woud-be D&aelig;dalus <br />
Invoked his sire to burn me. None the less <br />
This depth I found, by Minos judged aright, <br />
Who errs not ever, and flung me downward thus <br />
To this tenth blackness, for the alchemy <br />
I practised.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Surely,&#8221; to my guide I said, <br />
&#8220;There is no people of such vanity, <br />
Not even the French, as are the Sienese.&#8221; <br />
Whereat the second of the leprous dead <br />
Made answer, &#8220;Save the Stricca, who contrived <br />
Such modest spending, or the youth who thrived <br />
On his new cookery of the clove; or they <br />
Who aided Caccia&#8217;s haste to cast away <br />
Forest and vineyard: &#8211; but that thou mayst know <br />
Who thus gibes with thee at the Sienese, <br />
Look closely, that mine altered face may show. <br />
I am the shadow of Capocchio <br />
Who made false metals by mine alchemies. <br />
If whom I think thou art, thyself couldst tell <br />
If false I coined, I coined that falsehood well.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Canto XXX</p>
<p>
WHEN Juno&#8217;s hate, enwrathed for Semele, <br />
Repeated evils on the Theban blood, <br />
Athamas to such madness sank that he, <br />
Who saw his wife approach, each burdened arm <br />
Bearing a son, cried out, &#8220;The nets we spread. <br />
We take the lioness and her cubs!&#8221; and so <br />
With pitiless claws he dashed the elder dead, <br />
Whereat she leapt, still burdened, to the flood, <br />
And drowned that other, and herself. And when <br />
The Trojans&#8217; heavenward pride was cast so low <br />
That king and kingdom ceased, Hecuba then <br />
Saw Polyxena slain, and on the sand <br />
Lay Polydore, and all her misery <br />
Her mournful captive mind refused, and she <br />
Barked like a dog, to such forlorn degree <br />
Had sorrow moved her. But the Theban land <br />
Such furies held not, nor the Trojans met <br />
Such naked hate, as here I saw. There ran <br />
Two shades with rabid working jaws, that bit <br />
As snaps a sow thrust outward from the sty, <br />
The full trough waiting. One bent down, and set <br />
Its teeth behind Capocchio&#8217;s neck, and so <br />
It dragged him, while his belly rubbed the grit. <br />
Whereat the trembling Arentine began, <br />
&#8220;That goblin is Gianni Schicchi. Thus <br />
He mangles &#8211; &#8221; <br />
&#8220;May that other&#8217;s teeth forego <br />
Thy neck-joint ever! Grudge thou not to show <br />
Who is she, ere she passes hence.&#8221; <br />
He said, <br />
&#8220;That female imp, the ancient shade is she <br />
Of Myrrha, who with love flagitious <br />
Approached her father in false garb, as he <br />
Who gnaws Capocchio, aped Donati&#8217;s dead, <br />
The will by which the priceless mare he won <br />
Dictating in that guise.&#8221; <br />
The furious two <br />
Passed onward, mangling as they went, and I <br />
The ill-born shadows more surveyed. Was one <br />
Shaped like a lute, had but his groin begun <br />
A forkless form. The heavy dropsy drew <br />
His lips apart, as those whom fevers burn.</p>
<p>He said, &#8220;O ye, no penal fate who earn <br />
Amidst this grimness, turn your eyes to see, <br />
And hearken that which makes my misery <br />
Beyond the eyes&#8217; observing. Justice sets <br />
Before my sight the cool fresh rivulets <br />
That Casentino&#8217;s verdant hills provide <br />
For Arno&#8217;s fullness. Down the mountain side <br />
They fall for ever in my sight, and so <br />
Contain more torture than this swollen woe <br />
That from my visage wears the flesh. The sight <br />
That gives my frequent sighs a faster flight <br />
Is justly of the place that saw my sin, <br />
Mine own Romena, where the false alloy <br />
I mixed and printed with the Baptist&#8217;s head, <br />
For which they burnt me. When on earth, I had <br />
All earth&#8217;s delights my fraudful wealth could buy. <br />
A drop of water now would make me glad; <br />
But had I Branda&#8217;s fount, to lave therein, <br />
It would not yield me such exceeding joy <br />
As would the sight of Alessandro dead, <br />
Or Guido in such misery here as I. <br />
One, if the ravening shadows do not lie, <br />
Is here already. Had I strength to move <br />
One inch of journey in a hundred years, <br />
I had been started on the road to prove <br />
So fair a rumour, and behold his tears. <br />
Yea, though eleven miles the circle bends, <br />
And half a mile its crowded breadth extends &#8211; <br />
For by their tempting in this sink I lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked him, &#8220;Next thy swollen boundary, <br />
Right-hand, how name ye those unmoving two <br />
That steam like hands in winter bathed?&#8221; <br />
He said, <br />
&#8220;When first I tumbled in this pot to stew, <br />
So lay they both. They have not raised a head. <br />
I think they will not through eternity. <br />
The nearer is the wife of Potiphar <br />
The other Sinon, that false Greek of Troy. <br />
From burning fever reek they thus.&#8221; <br />
Too far <br />
His scorn betrayed him. In a fierce annoy <br />
The Trojan smote him with a lifted arm, <br />
The rigid belly like a beaten drum <br />
Resounding. <br />
&#8220;Though my heavy limbs subtract <br />
The power of motion, for so foul an act <br />
My arm yet serves me.&#8221; &#8211; So the Brescian said, <br />
And brought it down upon the fevered head. <br />
&#8220;It served thee little from a larger harm, <br />
Or wherefore in full manhood didst thou come <br />
Amongst us from the stake? It served, no doubt, <br />
The base alloy to mix, and stamp it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dropsied answered, &#8220;That on earth I burnt <br />
Is truth, but say how long thy tongue hath learnt <br />
Such custom? Falsehood was thine earthly skill.&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered, &#8220;If I lied, thy trade could still <br />
Outpace me. Would&#8217;st thou chide a lonely lie? <br />
A thousand times thy hand would falsify. <br />
There is no demon here could match the sum <br />
Of thine iniquities.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Such magnitude <br />
Had thy one falsehood, all the world has spewed <br />
Its indignation on thy name: be that <br />
The heaviest burden of thy guilt.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Be thine <br />
The thirst that cracks thee, and the putrid filth <br />
By which thou art distended.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Like a cat <br />
Thy jaw spits fury, as in life; if mine <br />
Be moisture-swollen thirst, no fairer tilth <br />
Ye garner for your gain,&#8221; the Brescian said. <br />
&#8220;The burning fever and the aching head. <br />
I think Narcissus&#8217; mirror would not shine <br />
For long unlicked beneath thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>While they jarred <br />
I paused to hear them, till my Master said, <br />
&#8220;A little longer, and thy fixed regard <br />
Will end our friendship.&#8221;</p>
<p>When his anger showed <br />
So sharply, all with sudden shame I glowed, <br />
And might not answer. On I walked as one <br />
Who dreams and wishes that the dream were done, <br />
So evil turns it while he dreams, and so <br />
Desires and knows not his desire is true. <br />
So walked I in my shame and did not know <br />
My shame forgave me in his thought. I knew <br />
His anger, only in my thought alive, <br />
Until he told me, &#8220;Weaker shame than thine <br />
A greater fault would cancel; therefore cease <br />
A grief too weighty. When we next arrive <br />
At any kindred scene, thy mind release <br />
More quickly. Discord in such filth is nought. <br />
The thought to hear it is a vulgar thought.&#8221;</p>
