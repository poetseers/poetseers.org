				<p>Canto XXXI</p>
<p>
So healed he with the tongue that hurt before, <br />
Like that charmed spear which could the wounds restore <br />
That first it made; and neither spake we more <br />
The while we climbed from out the final pit, <br />
To reach a hollow where nor dark nor day <br />
Was round us. Here a horn above me blew <br />
So loud that thunder to the noise of it <br />
Were weakness. Not so loud Orlando&#8217;s horn <br />
Called vainly from the rout that cast away <br />
An empire&#8217;s purpose. Up I looked, and knew <br />
A range of towers confronted, and thereat <br />
I questioned, &#8220;Master, say what town is that <br />
So near us?&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Through the veil of darkness drawn, <br />
The distance mocks thee. Let us haste, that so <br />
The truth be shown,&#8221; he said, and then &#8211; &#8220;But no,&#8221; <br />
And took me kindly by the hand, &#8211; &#8220;the worst <br />
Will seem less dreadful, if I show thee first. <br />
They are not towers in a circling wall, <br />
But giants planted round the pit, that all <br />
Show upwards from the navel.&#8221; As the mist <br />
Thins slowly, by the morning sunlight kissed <br />
Till hidden forms show vaguely, and reshape <br />
Their gradual outlines as the vapour leaves <br />
The obstructed air, the gloom, as near we drew, <br />
Reformed my error with a closer view <br />
More frightful. For the nether pit receives <br />
Their legs and bellies, while the rest doth rise <br />
Like Montereggione&#8217;s towers, that crown <br />
The wall&#8217;s full circle. Upwards from the thighs <br />
One monster faced me. Nature found escape <br />
From such creation ere our time, and well <br />
She chose her condemnation. Still Jove&#8217;s frown <br />
Against them thunders. If the monstrous whale <br />
Its breed continue, or the elephant, <br />
They do not vainly through their bulk rebel <br />
Against the rule of nature. Wits are scant, <br />
And weight is harmless. When they both unite <br />
What is there in mankind that might prevail <br />
To make defence against them? <br />
Like the pine <br />
That stands before St. Peter&#8217;s, such the sight <br />
His visage showed me. All the rest alike <br />
Was monstrous. Aproned by the bank, he yet <br />
Such stature showed, that three tall Frisians <br />
One on the other, could not thus combine <br />
To reach his hair. The savage mouth began, <br />
Rafel mai amech zabi almi, <br />
To shout in rage toward us. Speech of man <br />
It might not nearer. In full scorn my guide <br />
The meaning of that barren noise supplied, <br />
&#8220;His own his accusation. Nimrod he, <br />
Who brought confusion on the tongues we speak; <br />
In vain for converse here your questions seek. <br />
He comprehends our speech no more than we <br />
The sounds he rumbles. Dullard! take thy horn. <br />
On thine own breast it hangs, and yet thy mind <br />
Confuses, that it may not always find <br />
And vent its passion with such blasts.&#8221; <br />
We went <br />
Left-hand, and pacing thence a cross-bow shot, <br />
A fiercer and more monstrous monument <br />
Appalled me. Who the artist, once who got <br />
Those cords around him, daunts my mind, but so <br />
It had been. His right arm behind his back, <br />
Five times were girt the parts exposed. <br />
&#8220;Attack,&#8221; <br />
My Master told, &#8220;against high Jove he planned, <br />
What time the giants with the gods at war <br />
Affrighted Heaven. Hence the equal law <br />
That binds the arms he lifted. This ye see <br />
Is Ephialtes.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Master, might there be <br />
Among these shapes the bulk of Briareus?&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Yea, but far off he stands, and bound is he <br />
Alike to this one, though of face more grim. <br />
But Ant&aelig;us, who did not war with Zeus, <br />
Is near, and as there are no bonds on him, <br />
He shall convey us down the sink of guilt.&#8221;</p>
<p>No earthquake sways a massive tower as then <br />
The bulk of Ephialtes, straining, shook <br />
To break that bondage. Dread, that made me look, <br />
So worked that fear alone my life had spilt, <br />
Had not the strong bands cheered me. <br />
On we went <br />
And Ant&aelig;us reached, five ells of height who showed <br />
Above the edge whereon we walked, although <br />
One half was in the dreadful cave below <br />
To which we journeyed. <br />
&#8220;Thou, who once abode,&#8221; <br />
My guide addressed him, &#8220;in that vale of fate <br />
From which the broken Carthaginians fled, <br />
To Scipio&#8217;s glory; thou, whose hands have caught <br />
A thousand lions for thine ancient prey; <br />
Thou, whose strong aid, it seems, had likely brought <br />
The strife Titanic to a different day <br />
From that which closed it, &#8211; set us down, I pray, <br />
Upon the frozen floor, and be not shy <br />
To help us. Surely, should we further go <br />
For aid to Typhon or to Tizeo, <br />
The hope of larger fame thy name shall miss, <br />
For this man&#8217;s life resumes on earth, and he <br />
Can lift thy boast anew. I know for this <br />
All creatures long in Hell.&#8221; <br />
My Master&#8217;s plea <br />
So wrought, that hasteful were the monster&#8217;s hands <br />
To lift us. In the grasp that Hercules <br />
Once felt to fearing was he raised, and I <br />
Caught to him, in one bundle held. As seems <br />
The Carisenda to a man that stands <br />
Beneath the leaning side, when overhead <br />
A low cloud darkens, till its bulk he deems <br />
To overweight it, so the Titan showed <br />
To me beneath. By some alternate road <br />
My choice had lain, but ere my doubt was said <br />
He placed us gently on the dreadful bed <br />
Where Judas is devoured with Lucifer, <br />
And having loosed us on the icy plain, <br />
Like a ship&#8217;s mast he raised himself again.</p>
<p>
Canto XXXII</p>
<p>
IF words were mine unlike our mortal tongue <br />
In which the beauty of all heights is sung, <br />
I might attempt with greater confidence <br />
The core of my conception here. But whence <br />
Are words for things undreamed? What words are fit <br />
In harsh discordance for the utmost pit? <br />
I have no words, and fear to speak, but yet <br />
It must be. <br />
Muses, by whose art was set <br />
The Theban cincture of strong walls, lead on! <br />
Grant me thy power, as once to Amphion, <br />
That speech for truth interpret. <br />
Here converge <br />
The rocky causeways. In this pit submerge <br />
The vomits of creation. All its weight <br />
Is pressed upon them. Here the miscreate <br />
Lament their own existing. Oh, what curse <br />
Here in the bottom of the Universe <br />
Had lifted, had they been but goats! To me <br />
It seems for men too dreadful. <br />
Down the slope <br />
We started from the Titan&#8217;s feet, and while <br />
I still gazed backward at the wall, I heard <br />
A cry beneath me, &#8220;Heed ye where ye tread <br />
Lest fall thy weight on some grief-weary head <br />
That here lamenteth.&#8221; <br />
Then I looked, and lo! <br />
No ground I trod, but all the space below <br />
Was glass transparent. Not the underflow <br />
Of Austrian Danube from the weight of snow <br />
Such roof divides. Not Don, alone that lies <br />
Beneath the silence of the frozen skies, <br />
Such mantle wears. Sclavonia&#8217;s lonely height <br />
Had fallen here, or Lucca&#8217;s mountain white, <br />
And had not cracked it. <br />
As the frogs at night <br />
Sit croaking, with their heads above the stream, <br />
While on the bank the gleaner rests, adream <br />
Of fields she emptied, so the miscreants lay <br />
Frozen in firm ice, so deeply sunk that they <br />
Showed livid through the hard transparency <br />
That bound them, with their heads alone left free, <br />
And chattering jaws that rapped the ice, and made <br />
A noise of storks conversing. More betrayed <br />
Their ceaseless tears the bitter woes they knew, &#8211; <br />
Salt tears that froze in falling. <br />
Here were two <br />
So closely brothered in that frozen bed <br />
That face to face the hair of either head <br />
Was mingled, and their hidden features pressed <br />
Each other. <br />
&#8220;Tell me, ye that breast to breast <br />
So consort,&#8221; asked I, &#8220;who on earth ye be?&#8221; <br />
Whereat they bent their backward necks to see <br />
Who called, and as their faces rose apart <br />
The tears that ever from their eyes would start <br />
The fierce cold hardened at their source, and held <br />
Their eyelids firm as any smith should weld, <br />
Or wood to wood with iron is clamped. Whereat, <br />
Like he-goats angered, both their heads began <br />
To butt the other in their rage. With that <br />
Another near, who did not lift his face, <br />
Whose ears the frost had taken, gave reply, <br />
&#8220;Why seek ye, gazing at our woeful case, <br />
To read us? If for aught ye list to know <br />
Those twain, the vale of the Bisenzio <br />
Was theirs, from Count Alberto. From one womb <br />
They came, and search ye all the dreadful doom <br />
Of this Caina where ye stand, not one <br />
Is here more worthy of the frozen pie <br />
In which they serve us. Not that wretch fordone <br />
By Arthur&#8217;s hand, who pierced him, front and back <br />
And shadow at once; nor he that next doth lie <br />
Beyond me, Mascheroni, &#8211; if ye come <br />
From Tuscan hills, my words ye will not lack <br />
To place him; &#8211; nor Focaccia. Lest ye try <br />
To vex me with more words, de Pazzi I; <br />
I wait Carlino here, to justify <br />
My lighter guilt.&#8221; <br />
Of doggish faces, numb <br />
With frozen torture, round our feet there lay <br />
A thousand. Still my shuddering thought recalls, <br />
And shivers ever as the frozen ford <br />
I strive to think not. Was it destiny, <br />
Or chance, or will? My doubt I own, but while <br />
We trod mid-distance of the final mile, <br />
My foot caught sharply one projecting head. <br />
Whereat it raised a weeping voice, and said, <br />
&#8220;Why dost thou trample thus the doomed, unless <br />
Thou come designed to deal more bitterness <br />
In hate for Montaperto?&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Master, stay <br />
One moment here, and any more delay <br />
I will not ask.&#8221; <br />
My Master paused, and I <br />
To that reviling spirit gave reply, <br />
For still it cursed me, &#8211; &#8220;Tell me who thou art, <br />
Who thus reproachest?&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Nay, but be thy part <br />
To tell me first. Who art thou stumbling thus <br />
Through Antenora, on the cheeks of us <br />
Who suffer? Wert thou yet in life, it were <br />
Too much to pardon.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Nay, I live; but say <br />
The name thou hadst, and I will make thy day <br />
A longer on the earth than else thy share <br />
Of fame continue.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Nay, ye little know <br />
The words of flattery on this slope of woe. <br />
We lust oblivion only. Get ye gone! <br />
Nor vex me further.&#8221; <br />
By the after-scalp <br />
I gripped him roughly. &#8220;Speak, or every hair <br />
That grows upon thee, from the root I tear, <br />
Before I leave thee on this icy alp.&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered, &#8220;Though the final hair ye pick, <br />
And though my face a thousand times ye kick, <br />
I will not tell you.&#8221; <br />
In my hand his hair <br />
Was twisted, and an ample tuft was flung <br />
Loose on the ice, he barking out despair <br />
And rage together, when the song he sung <br />
Aroused his neighbour, &#8220;Bocca, what thy woe? <br />
Canst thou not chatter with thy jaws as we, <br />
And cease thy barking? What strange fiend supplies <br />
An extra pain?&#8221; <br />
I said, &#8220;Thy name I know, <br />
And would no more. Accursed, traitorous! <br />
Thy name a byword on the earth shall be; <br />
For I will tell thy treasons.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;He who lies <br />
So near, and talks so glibly, thou canst tell, <br />
And not me only. Thou canst speak it thus, &#8211; <br />
&#8216;Close-pinched with Bocca in the frozen hell <br />
I saw Duera. There his chattering jaws <br />
Bewail the Frenchman&#8217;s silver bribe.&#8217; If more <br />
They ask, who shiver in the icy claws, <br />
Boccaria lies beyond, whose neck was slit <br />
At Florence: and Soldanire thou canst say <br />
Is not far distant; and Ganelone; <br />
And Tribaldello fails not to deplore <br />
The gates he opened in the night.&#8221; <br />
We stayed <br />
To hear no further. In short space ahead <br />
We saw two frozen in one hole. As bread <br />
Is gnawed in hunger: as Menalippus <br />
Was chewed by Tydeus: so the upmost head <br />
Gripped with its teeth the neck beneath, and tore <br />
Just where the nape and brain unite. I said, <br />
&#8220;O thou, so hard whose bestial hatred gnaws <br />
Thy mate in condemnation, if good cause <br />
Thy rage explain, it were thy gain with us <br />
To share it. Upward I return once more, <br />
And surely as my speech remain, I then <br />
Will give thee justice in the mouths of men.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Canto XXXIII</p>
<p>
THE sinner ceased his ghastly meal, and wiped <br />
His jaws upon the victim&#8217;s hair, and said, <br />
&#8220;Thou willest that reluctant words recall <br />
A grief so dire it wrings my heart, before <br />
An utterance forms, but if my speech shall fall <br />
A seed that fruiting backward from the dead <br />
Shall make him whom I tear infamed the more <br />
Among our people, then I gladly weep <br />
To tell thee. How to this sad depth ye came, <br />
Where no man erst has been, nor what thy name <br />
I know, but that familiar speech of thine <br />
I heard, and hailed thee friend and Florentine, <br />
- For I was Ugolino. Him I keep <br />
In this remembrance of an earthly woe, <br />
The arch-priest Ubaldini. Now I tell <br />
Of that which brought us to this depth of Hell, <br />
And why high Justice thus permits that I <br />
Feed here, and shall not starve, and shall not die, <br />
Nor cease my feeding. All I need not say <br />
Of mutual fraud, nor how he snared away <br />
My life, a tale for other tongues, but this, <br />
The cruel fate I found, they well may miss, <br />
It was so secret. In that hole which now <br />
Is called the Dungeon of the Starved I lay, <br />
And watched the narrow slit by night and day, <br />
Until nine moons across its space of sky <br />
Had ended, when the evil dream I knew <br />
That did the curtain of my fate untie.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seemed that on the Pisan hills was I, <br />
A gaunt wolf with his weary whelps that ran, <br />
And after came the hounds; and there a man <br />
That cheered them on; the lord of all was he, <br />
This Ubaldini, and before him rode <br />
Gualandi, and Sismondi, and thereby <br />
Lanfranchi; and the hounds, that closer drew, <br />
Were swift and lean and eager. I could see <br />
The wolf among his whelps, that was but I <br />
And my young sons, grow weary, and the hounds <br />
Were tearing at their flanks. I waked to find <br />
The night yet darkened, but the moaning sounds <br />
My sons were making in their sleep for bread <br />
Had roused me. Cruel were the hearer&#8217;s heart <br />
Who would not weep for that their cries forebode. <br />
If not for this, for what should tears have part? <br />
It was the first day that we were not fed. <br />
The hour recurred. With anxious eyes, and <br />
Of any speech we waited. Now they come <br />
- The steps we know &#8211; we heard the echoing <br />
That locked and sealed us from the world: we heard <br />
The steps recede. I had not wept nor stirred. <br />
I watched them weeping till the youngest said, <br />
&#8216;Father, what ails thee? Wilt thou speak?&#8217; But I <br />
Gazed and not moved, and could not find reply. <br />
And all that day not any word I said, <br />
And all that night, nor any tears I shed, <br />
Till through the bars the morning light anew <br />
Revealed our grief, and in my sons I knew <br />
The aspect of myself, and anguish wrought <br />
Within me, till I gnawed my hands. Whereat <br />
They answered (impulsed by a single thought <br />
That hunger urged me), &#8216;Father, do not stay <br />
Thine hand against us. Shouldst thou take away <br />
The lives we owe thee, right it were, and less <br />
To us the pain, that from the flesh we give <br />
Thy life continue.&#8217; <br />
Then I strove subdue <br />
The anguish in me, lest I more distress <br />
The sons beyond myself I loved. That day, <br />
And all the next, in silent pain we lay <br />
On earth too hard to take us. After that <br />
Death came. For when the next sad dawn was dim <br />
Fell Gaddo at my feet, and with one cry, <br />
&#8216;O father, wilt thou aid us nought?&#8217; he died. <br />
And two days more I watched, and after him, <br />
One after one, beheld them fall and die. <br />
Then, blind with famine, three days more I groped <br />
Around them, till my grief no more denied <br />
The pangs of fasting&#8221; &#8211; as these words he said, <br />
With hateful eyes upon his murderer&#8217;s head, <br />
Again he seized it in strong teeth that bit <br />
Hard on the bone. Ah, Pisa! since thy state <br />
Thy neighbours leave, and all vituperate <br />
Who know thee, shall not those two isles, that lie <br />
So near, block Arno at its mouth, and throw <br />
Its waters on thee till the depth of it <br />
Hath drowned the last man in thy walls? For though <br />
Had Ugolino all thy towers betrayed, <br />
It were not right for one man traitorous <br />
His children in their youth to torture thus <br />
To innocent death, thou Thebes of Italy! <br />
And therefore shall their frustrate names remain <br />
In minds of all men where my tale is made. <br />
Uguccione and Bragata they, <br />
Anselm and Gaddo. <br />
On we went, to see <br />
A varied torment. Here the frozen pain <br />
That bowed those others, bends its victims back. <br />
They may not weep. The fount of tears they lack. <br />
For all the hollows of their eyes are filled <br />
With hardened ice. The tears that first they spilled <br />
Are crystal visors to their sight. <br />
To me, <br />
Though cold had calloused all my face by now, <br />
It seemed a wind was passing. To my guide <br />
I questioned, &#8220;Master, is not vital heat <br />
Extinguished here? Can utter cold allow <br />
This downward air?&#8221; <br />
He answered. &#8220;Soon we meet <br />
Its cause, and sight shall tell thee.&#8221; <br />
Near us cried <br />
A wretch that marked us of the frozen host, <br />
&#8220;O souls so cruel that the latest post <br />
Is here assigned ye, will ye break away <br />
The blocks one moment from mine eyes, that stay <br />
The waiting tears?&#8221; <br />
We paused, and I replied. <br />
&#8220;Then tell us who thou art, and whence thy doom, <br />
And he should well deserve the frozen tomb <br />
Who did not aid thee.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Alberigo I, <br />
The Jovial Friar, whom Manfred brought to die! <br />
The evil fruit that in my orchard grew <br />
Returns. The figs I gave: the dates I pick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; said I, &#8220;hast thou also left the quick <br />
So soon?&#8221; <br />
He said, &#8220;I know not. We that lie <br />
In Ptolom&aelig;a, oft this depth descend <br />
Before our bodies reach their natural end. <br />
For those that like myself to death betray <br />
Their friends, a waiting demon drags away, <br />
Casts to this cistern of our kind, and then <br />
His body takes, and in the ways of men <br />
Controls it, till his time be spent. Behind <br />
Is Brancha d&#8217;Oria. If his corse have died, <br />
Who here finds winter, better chance have ye <br />
Than I to tell, who earlier came, but he <br />
Long years has suffered in this ice.&#8221; <br />
I said, <br />
&#8220;I think thou liest. Brancha is not dead. <br />
He lives on earth, and in our mortal way <br />
His body eats and sleeps and warms today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where boils the pitch, ere Michel Zanche came, <br />
Within the Malebranche&#8217;s ditch,&#8221; said he, <br />
&#8220;This man a demon in his place had left, <br />
And one beside who shared his perfidy <br />
Came likewise ere his time; but reach thy hand <br />
To do the service that my speech can claim.&#8221; <br />
I heard, but different course my heart had planned <br />
Since horror learnt his name. The ice uncleft <br />
Still blinds him. Rudeness there was courtesy.</p>
<p>Ah, men corrupt from God! Ye Genoese, <br />
Why do ye haste not on your path to these, <br />
And earth seem cleaner? With Romagna&#8217;s worst, <br />
I found Ser Brancha, for his soul&#8217;s disease <br />
Ere death who suffers in this place accurst.</p>
<p>
Canto XXXIV</p>
<p>
THE lifted banners of the King of Hell,&#8221; <br />
- My leader roused me from my thought &#8211; <br />
&#8220;are nigh; <br />
Look therefore.&#8221; I beheld, as in such sky <br />
As foul mist hides, or murk of night obscures, <br />
A turning windmill loom; and such the gale <br />
Its motions caused, that I, of strength too frail <br />
To meet it longer, shrank behind my guide.</p>
<p>Beneath our feet &#8211; but memory fears to tell &#8211; <br />
The sinners here contained in Hell&#8217;s last sewers <br />
Were frozen solid in firm ice, and shone <br />
Like straw in glass; and as we walked thereon <br />
We saw some flat, and some with heads below, <br />
And some pulled backward like a bended bow, <br />
And some were upright. <br />
When we got so near <br />
I needs must see, my leader stepped aside. <br />
He said, &#8220;Let fortitude reject thy fear, <br />
For Dis confronts thee.&#8221; <br />
There I think I died, <br />
Though living. Not the icy blast I met <br />
A living man could face, a dead could feel. <br />
But here speech fails me. Reader, words are nought <br />
To help me further. To thy livelier thought <br />
I leave it. <br />
Breast-deep in the ice was set <br />
The Emperor of the dolorous realm; but yet <br />
So huge he towered that I should seem more fit <br />
With giants to consort, than a giant compare <br />
With one arm only. He, that once so fair <br />
Could walk assured in Heaven, the lordliest there <br />
Beneath his Maker, fills this glacial pit <br />
If by his woe we price his earlier weal, <br />
Or judge his glory by his aspect now, <br />
Well may he fount affliction. For one head <br />
I saw three faces. One was fiery red. <br />
The others slanting from each shoulder rose <br />
To form one crest that shapes creation&#8217;s woes. <br />
One pallid yellow, one the sable hue <br />
Of those who wander from the tropic land <br />
Wherefrom the sources of the Nile expand. <br />
There were two wings the three foul heads below <br />
Such bird to suit. I never saw such spread <br />
Of ocean canvas to the wind: but these <br />
Were bat-like, plumeless, and the wind they bred, <br />
- They flapped unceasing &#8211; caused the glacier freeze <br />
Down which we traversed. With six eyes he wept, <br />
The while a sinner in each mouth he kept, <br />
And chewed, and loosed not. Tears and foam unite <br />
With dribbling blood, that spurts from every bite <br />
Down his three chins. The midmost was not bit <br />
So much as torn. At times his back was flayed <br />
All bare of skin. <br />
&#8220;That soul that most endures, <br />
Whose head Apollyon in his mouth hath got, <br />
Whose legs kick outward, is Iscariot:&#8221; <br />
My Master told, &#8220;of those whose heads may quit <br />
The teeth that chew them, down the swarthier chin <br />
Is Brutus dangling. Mark how silently <br />
He writhes. The comrade of his doom is he <br />
Who shared that treason, Cassius. &#8211; But the night <br />
Is rising in the world without, and we <br />
Must hasten. All is seen that lies herein, <br />
And hence depart we.&#8221; <br />
At his word I put <br />
My arm around him. He with lifted foot <br />
His opening watched, and when the wings were wide <br />
Leapt from the glacier to the tangled side, <br />
And midst the shaggy tufts of frozen hair <br />
The scaly hide descended. <br />
When we came <br />
To pass the swelling of the haunch, my guide <br />
With arduous effort turned, till where his head <br />
Had been before, he placed his feet instead, <br />
And gripped the hair as one that mounts. I thought <br />
That backwards into Hell his path he sought. <br />
But he, hard-panting with that toil, replied, <br />
&#8220;Hold fast &#8211; be silent &#8211; by this only stair <br />
We find Hell&#8217;s exit.&#8221; <br />
Thus he climbed to where <br />
An opening gashed the rock, and reaching there <br />
He placed me on the ledge, and warily <br />
Himself stepped after. Here I looked to see <br />
Again the front of Lucifer, and lo! <br />
His legs stuck upward. <br />
Were a man too dense <br />
To understand the point we passed, he still <br />
Might judge the toil before me, to return <br />
To earth&#8217;s far surface. &#8220;Gain thy feet, for ill <br />
The pathway climbs,&#8221; my guide enjoined, &#8220;that hence <br />
Shall take us, as thy weary steps must learn, <br />
And in the outer skies the sun midway <br />
To noon is lifted.&#8221; <br />
Round I looked, and saw <br />
No palace, but such cleft in earth&#8217;s deep maw <br />
As likest to a natural dungeon showed, <br />
Ill-floored, ill-lighted. <br />
&#8220;Ere this evil road,&#8221; <br />
I answered, rising, &#8220;leave the deep abyss, <br />
I pray thee tell me, lest my thought should err, <br />
Why upward rise the legs of Lucifer, <br />
And where the icy plain we crossed? and how <br />
The morning shines without, which was but now <br />
To night descending?&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Dost thou spare to think <br />
Its meaning? Downward through the central sink <br />
We passed. We have not backward climbed to where <br />
I leapt, but holding by the frozen hair <br />
We scaled this maggot of the evil core <br />
To which all weights conclude; and when, midway, <br />
We turned with effort, then beneath us lay <br />
That half the world from which we came, and we <br />
Look upward to that other world of sea <br />
Which those who sail beyond thine hemisphere <br />
Have found, and left uncharted. Standing here <br />
Beneath us is the great dry land that lies <br />
Within the cover of the northern skies, <br />
And centres round the Sacred Mount whereon <br />
The Holiest died. Above us reaches far <br />
The region where the pathless oceans are; <br />
For this side fell from Heaven the Worm of Hell <br />
And all the land drew backward where he fell, <br />
And hid beneath the waters. There is morn <br />
When nightfall closes on thy northern land; <br />
And there our issue, for a stream has worn <br />
A tortuous passage from the outer skies <br />
To this foul pit where Beelzebub lies, <br />
And through the darkness of the toilsome way <br />
Its sound must lead us.&#8221; <br />
Nothing more we said, <br />
Nor paused for rest, however jagged and rough <br />
And dark the path we climbed, and long enough <br />
For mortal feet to weary. Fast he led: <br />
And I made tireless by that hope ahead <br />
Pursued him upward, till the rocks were rent <br />
With first a sight of Heaven&#8217;s clear firmament, <br />
And then the earth&#8217;s clean airs with learnt delight <br />
I breathed, and round me was the beauteous night, <br />
And overhead the stars.</p>
