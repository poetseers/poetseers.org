				<p>Canto XI</p>
<p>
BUT boldly outward from the wall we went, <br />
Down sloping, till a sudden steep descent <br />
Before us yawned. The sides, extending far, <br />
Of broken rocks, a great pit circular <br />
Enclosed. Beneath our feet a fouler throng <br />
Than that we left, upcast a stench so vile <br />
We might not face, but left our course awhile <br />
To crouch behind a stone-built monument, <br />
Whereon I read, &#8220;Pope Anastasius <br />
Is here, who sold his faith for Photinus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then spake my Master. &#8220;Till the fetid air <br />
By gradual use we take, we must not dare <br />
Continue downward.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Show me, while we stay, <br />
The meanings of this foul and dreadful way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I meant it, surely,&#8221; said my guide. &#8220;Behold <br />
The space beneath us. There three circlets lie, <br />
Alike to those we left behind, but why <br />
This deeper fate is theirs, I first will show; <br />
And when we pass them in the depths below <br />
Ye need not wait to question what ye see.</p>
<p>&#8220;All malice of men&#8217;s hearts in injury <br />
Results, and hence to Heaven is odious; <br />
And all the malice that aggrieveth thus <br />
Strikes in two ways, by either force or fraud; <br />
And fraud in man is vice peculiar, <br />
That from Hell&#8217;s centre to the utmost star <br />
Is else unknown, and is to God therefore <br />
Most hateful Hence the violent-sinful lie <br />
Outward, and inmost are the fraudulent. <br />
And as the sinful-violent make their war <br />
On God, their neighbours, or themselves, so they <br />
Are portioned in the outer wards. <br />
I say, <br />
To them, or to the things they own, the wrong <br />
May aim. By violence, wounds or death may be, <br />
Extortions, burnings, wastes; and ye shall see <br />
That equal in the outmost round belong <br />
Reivers of life alike, and plunderers. <br />
And in the second round are those whose sin <br />
Is violence to themselves; they weep therein, <br />
Repenting when too late, whose hands destroy <br />
Their earthly bodies; and condemned alike <br />
Are those with profligate wasteful hands who strike <br />
At their own wealth, or having cause for joy <br />
Reject it, weeping with no need. The third <br />
And smallest of the outer circlets holds <br />
All those with violence of blaspheming words, <br />
Or in their hearts, the Lord of Life deny, <br />
The wealth of Nature that the world enfolds <br />
Contemning. Hence by lust or usury, <br />
Sodom or Cahors, the downward path may be <br />
That ends in this destruction. <br />
Fraud, that gnaws <br />
The universal conscience of mankind, <br />
Is also different in its guilt, because <br />
It either at the stranger strikes behind, <br />
Or makes the sacred bond of confidence <br />
The means of its prevailing; and the first <br />
Breaks but the kindly general bond, and hence <br />
More outward in the final depths are cast <br />
Deceivers, flatterers, cheats, and sorcerers, <br />
Thieves, panders, and such filth. <br />
The last and worst <br />
And smallest circle holds such souls as break <br />
Not only in their guilt the natural bond <br />
That all men own, but in some trust, beyond <br />
The usual course, are faithless. In this lake, <br />
The base and centre of Dis, the inmost hell, <br />
All traitors in relentless torments dwell.&#8221;</p>
<p>I answered, &#8220;Master, clearer words than these <br />
I could not ask, the ranks of guilt to show, <br />
That gather in the dreadful gulfs below; <br />
But tell me, &#8211; those that in so great dis-ease <br />
We earlier passed, wind-beaten, choked with slime, <br />
Or chilled and flattened with unending rain, <br />
If God&#8217;s wrath reach them, why they yet remain <br />
Outside the hot walls of the Place of Pain? <br />
Or why they suffer through the night of Time <br />
So greatly, if they are not judged to Hell?&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered, &#8220;Surely ye recall not well <br />
The Ethics that your schools have taught, or wide <br />
Your thoughts have wandered from their wont, to cause <br />
A doubt so simple. Are there not three laws <br />
By which the ways of Hell from Heaven divide &#8211; <br />
Beast-treason, malice, and incontinence, <br />
And of these three the third the least offence <br />
To God provoketh, and receives less blame? <br />
Bethink the faults of those where first ye came <br />
Through circles loftier than the heated wall <br />
That now surrounds us, and ye well shall see <br />
Why with less wrath the strokes of justice fall <br />
On those left outward by divine decree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Light!&#8221; I said, &#8220;whose cheering rays dispel <br />
The mists that blind me, wilt thou further tell <br />
Why stands the customed toll of usury <br />
Condemned in thy discourse as direst sin, <br />
Abhorrent to the bounty of God?&#8221; <br />
He said, <br />
&#8220;The teaching of thine own Philosophy <br />
Is pregnant with this truth unborn. Therein <br />
Thou learn&#8217;st of God himself, interpreted <br />
In Nature&#8217;s ways; and as a child may tread <br />
Unsurely in its Master&#8217;s steps, thine art <br />
Interprets Nature in its turn, and is <br />
God&#8217;s grandchild therefore. Through these mysteries <br />
Look backward. When the Law of Eden came, <br />
How spake the Eternal Wisdom? Toil; It said, <br />
And in that labour find thy guerdon-bread: <br />
Be fruitful, and increase thy kind. His part <br />
God gave to man, so saying. The usurer <br />
Seeks not his profit in the path designed, <br />
But looks the fruit of others&#8217; toils to find, <br />
And pluck where nought he planted. <br />
More to say <br />
The time permits not; but the downward way <br />
We needs must venture. In the outer skies <br />
The Fishes from the pale horizon rise, <br />
And the Great Wain its shining course descends <br />
Where the night-lair of Caurus dark extends.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Canto XII</p>
<p>
NOW came we to the steep cliff-side. As where <br />
The Adige at the mountain bored until <br />
Fell the huge ruin of half its bulk, and there <br />
Turned the swift stream a further course to fill <br />
Beneath the scarred precipitous side, so here <br />
The shattered ominous cliffs descended sheer; <br />
And sprawled across the verge, Crete&#8217;s infamy, <br />
The fruit of that false cow, Pasipha&euml;, <br />
Was fearsome, that the boldest heart should flee.</p>
<p>To us he turned his red malignant eyes, <br />
Gnawing his own side, the while he strove to rise, <br />
As one made rageful past restraint, but loud <br />
My leader hailed him, &#8220;Think&#8217;st thou, overproud, <br />
That Theseus cometh, who gave thy death <br />
Not one that Ariadne taught is here, <br />
Nor destined victim for thy rage to gore, <br />
But one who walketh through the place of fear <br />
In safety, to behold the stripes ye bore.&#8221; <br />
As some roped bull, whose throat is stretched to feel <br />
The knife&#8217;s sharp doom, against the rending steel <br />
So madly wrenches that he breaks away, <br />
Already slaughtered, plunging while he may, <br />
But blindly and vainly, at this word I saw <br />
Heaving the huge bulk of the Minotaur, <br />
And cried my careful guide, &#8220;Descend with speed, <br />
The whilst he rages.&#8221; <br />
Down with watchful heed, <br />
But swiftly, clomb we by the rocks&#8217; rough side, <br />
The jutting stones that lightly held my guide <br />
Trembling beneath my earthlier weight. <br />
He said, <br />
Who watched my silence, &#8220;Likely turns thy thought <br />
To this rent ruin the gross beast guards. Before, <br />
When downward came I, of this fall was nought, <br />
But nearly after came that Lord who bore <br />
Out from the horror of Dis its choicer prey. <br />
Hell, to its loathliest entrails, felt that day <br />
Love&#8217;s coming, and trembled, and this mountain fell. <br />
The power of Love, that thus discomfits Hell, <br />
Oft in forgotten times, as sages tell, <br />
Hath changed our world to chaos. &#8211; But heed thy way. <br />
Before us is the gulf of blood wherein <br />
Murderers by violence purge their briefer sin. <br />
O blindness of their greed, or bestial rage! <br />
So short the war that on their kind they wage; <br />
So long is their repenting.&#8221; <br />
I beheld <br />
A wide moat, curving either hand, as though <br />
Its sweep surrounded all the plain. Below <br />
On the near bank, were Centaurs, each who held <br />
A spear for casting, or a bended bow, <br />
The while they raced along the brink, as when <br />
Their game they hunted in the world of men.</p>
<p>Seeing us, they stayed, and of the nearest, three <br />
Approached us, with the threats of shaft on string. <br />
One cried, &#8220;What torments do your guilts decree, <br />
Who cross Hell&#8217;s gaps in such strange wandering? <br />
How came ye loosened from your dooming? &#8211; Say, <br />
Lest the cord teach ye.&#8221; <br />
Unperturbed, my guide <br />
Gave answer. &#8220;Not for such vain threats we stay. <br />
To Chiron only will we speak. Thy will <br />
For rashness cost thee once thy life, and still <br />
Inciteth folly.&#8221; And then to me, &#8220;Behold <br />
Nessus, who once for Deianira died; <br />
Beyond is Chiron, round whose mighty knees <br />
Played once the infant years of Achilles; <br />
The rageful Pholus is the last; they go <br />
With thousand others around the moat, that so <br />
If any spirits the boiling blood would quit <br />
Beyond the licence of their dooms, they know <br />
A different anguish from the shafts that slit <br />
The parts shown naked.&#8221; <br />
These swift beasts and we <br />
Approached each other the while he spake, and he, <br />
Great Chiron, with a shaft&#8217;s notched end put back <br />
The beard that hindered both his jaws, and said, <br />
To those his comrades, &#8220;Not as walk the dead <br />
Doth this one coming, but with the weight they lack <br />
Disturbs the stones he treadeth.&#8221; <br />
My guide by now <br />
Stood where the human and the brute combined, <br />
Beneath his breast, and answered for me. &#8220;Yea, <br />
He lives indeed, and I, to lead his way, <br />
I race this dark valley. No sportive choice to find, <br />
But driven of need, he threads this night of flame; <br />
And She from singing Alleluias came <br />
Who bade me do it. No spirit condemned am I, <br />
Nor he deserving of thy doom. I pray, <br />
By virtue of the Name I will not say, <br />
l hat of thy comrades one thy care supply <br />
To guide us to the ford, and him to bear <br />
Across, who may not tread the yielding air <br />
As those discarnate.&#8221; <br />
Chiron&#8217;s bearded head <br />
Bent round to Nessus at his right, and said, <br />
&#8220;Turn, as they ask, and guide, and bear him through, <br />
And warn thy comrades that no wrong they do <br />
To these in passing.&#8221; <br />
In this trusty ward <br />
We held the margin of the purple flood <br />
That seethed beneath us. In the boiling blood <br />
Were spirits to the brows immersed. <br />
&#8220;Ye see,&#8221; <br />
Said Nessus, &#8220;tyrants who by weight of sword <br />
Spread death and rapine in their lands. Is here <br />
Fierce Dionysius, who the doleful year <br />
Made long to those he ruled in Sicily; <br />
And Alexander here repents; and he <br />
Whose brows o&#8217;erhung with night-black hair ye see <br />
Is Azzolino; and the head beyond <br />
Where on the stream the trailing mane is blonde, <br />
Obizzo, whom his stepson choked.&#8221; <br />
We came <br />
Where other spirits in the boiling pond <br />
Showed from the neck, and in this place beheld <br />
That Guy who to avenge his father&#8217;s name <br />
The English Henry at Viterbo felled, <br />
Even in the presence of God. The victim&#8217;s heart <br />
Yet raised in reverence on the bank of Thame, <br />
Recalls it, and the assassin boils apart <br />
Placed separate for the deed&#8217;s high blasphemy.</p>
<p>And further passed we those whose guilt allowed <br />
Of freedom to the waist. Among the crowd, <br />
More numerous now, were more in clearer view, <br />
That by themselves or by their deeds I knew, <br />
As shallower yet the seething purple grew, <br />
Till all except the miscreants&#8217; feet was free.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here must we cross the fosse,&#8221; the Centaur said, <br />
And I, sole living in this world of dead, <br />
Climbed upward, and my earthly weight he bore, <br />
And while he waded to the further shore <br />
Continued, &#8220;As the boiling stream ye see <br />
Diminish, so its bottom sinks anew <br />
Rounding the circle, till it comes once more <br />
To those whose ruling choked their world in gore, <br />
In which they suffer. High Justice here torments <br />
The pirate Sextus, and fierce Pyrrhus here; <br />
Attila with eternal tears laments; <br />
And Rinier Pazzo, once a word of fear, <br />
With Rinier of Corneto boils, to pay <br />
For bandit-murders on the State&#8217;s highway.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Canto XIII</p>
<p>
WHILE Nessus yet recrossed the purple stream <br />
A wood we entered where no path appeared, <br />
No cool wind stirred, nor any sun came through, <br />
But all the foliage, as by winter seared, <br />
Was brittle and brown, and gnarled and twisted grew <br />
The branches, and if any fruit did seem <br />
They were but poisonous pods to closer view. <br />
No denser holts the lurking beasts have found <br />
Beneath Corneto, where the marshy ground, <br />
Uncoultered, to Cecina&#8217;s stream declines.</p>
<p>Foul harpies nest amidst the loathly vines, <br />
Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades, <br />
With their drear wail of some awaiting woe. <br />
Their wings are wide: and like gross birds below <br />
Their bellies feathered, and their feet are clawed. <br />
Strange cries come from them through the sickly trees.</p>
<p>My Master told me, &#8220;Through this dismal land, <br />
The second circlet pass we, till we reach <br />
The place of that intolerable sand <br />
Which forms the third, and in its place completes <br />
The outer round. Recall my earlier speech <br />
That taught the order of these woes. Look well <br />
For confirmation of the things I tell &#8220;</p>
<p>I looked, but saw not. Every side there rose <br />
A wailing burdened with unnumbered woes, <br />
While all the woods were vacant. From ground <br />
It came not &#8211; rather from the boughs around <br />
It beat upon us, as voiced by those who hid <br />
Before our coming, the tangled growth amid.</p>
<p>My Master taught me. &#8220;If thou break away <br />
The nearest twig that meets thine hand, wilt see <br />
How far thy dreaming from the truth astray.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereat I reached, and from a twisted thorn <br />
That rose before us, withered, gaunt, forlorn, <br />
Broke short a twig, and from the trunk a cry <br />
Came sharply, &#8220;Tear not!&#8221; and a blood-gout <br />
Dark on the wound, the while the trunk anew <br />
Entreated, &#8220;Rend not; does no mercy lie <br />
In those that still their human forms retain? <br />
Men were we, till we left on earth self-slain <br />
The bodies given of God. But had we been <br />
The souls of serpents, in this hopeless dole <br />
We had not thought that any mortal soul <br />
Would wound us, helpless to their hands.&#8221; <br />
Hast seen <br />
Cast on the coals a living branch and green? <br />
One end already burns, and one projects <br />
Clear of the heat, but from the fire&#8217;s effects <br />
Moisture exudes and hissing wind. So here <br />
Blood welled and words from out the wound. The fear <br />
Of this strange voice, and pity, so in me wrought <br />
I dropt the broken shoot, and fixed in thought <br />
Stood silent. <br />
On my side my leader spake, <br />
&#8220;O wounded spirit, had his heart believed <br />
The truth that earlier in my verse he read, <br />
He had not with unthinking violence grieved <br />
The most unhappy of the hapless dead. <br />
But mine the word that caused his hand to break, <br />
Who knew that truth&#8217;s incredibility <br />
Would else confound him. It was grief to me <br />
To prompt him to it. But if thou speak and tell <br />
Of whom thou wast, he may requite thee well, <br />
Thy fame renewing in the world, for there <br />
He soon returneth.&#8221; <br />
And the voice replied, <br />
&#8220;The sound of thy seducing words and fair <br />
Constrains me to forgive thee, and confide <br />
The bitter grief that in my trunk I hide, <br />
Which else were silent always. With me bear <br />
In patience somewhat, if I talk too long, <br />
Caught in this bait of words, when all my wrong <br />
Returneth to me. In this toil is he, <br />
The second Frederick&#8217;s confident, who held <br />
His heart&#8217;s two keys, and turned them. Here ye see <br />
The ruin of too great fidelity, <br />
That sleep and life gave forfeit. Yea, for she, <br />
That harlot who in C&aelig;sar&#8217;s court rebelled <br />
Against all virtue round his throne, the bane <br />
And vice of all high concourse, Envy, stirred <br />
And slandered, till my Master half believed. <br />
And I, who all things at his hands received, <br />
And all myself had rendered, in disdain <br />
Gave silence only to the accusing word, <br />
And in contempt of life I broke the chain <br />
That held me to it. Just to others, I wrought <br />
Injustice to myself. But here I swear, <br />
By these sad roots that hold me, word nor thought, <br />
Nor deed nor negligence was mine in aught <br />
Against him faithless. Ye that upward bear <br />
The news and burden of our griefs below, <br />
Rebuild my memory in the world, I pray, <br />
That my rash hand prostrated.&#8221; <br />
Here his woe <br />
Found silence, and the things I sought to say <br />
I lacked the heart. Until, at last, my guide <br />
Enquired me, &#8220;Wouldst thou more?&#8221; and I replied, <br />
&#8220;Ask for me.&#8221; <br />
To the prisoned grief he said, <br />
&#8220;That this man gladly when he leave the dead <br />
Uplift thy record, as thy words entreat, <br />
Inform us further how this fate ye meet, <br />
How the bent soul these twisted knots allows; <br />
Or ever any from these tortured boughs <br />
Erect himself to manhood.&#8221; <br />
Then the tree <br />
Blew strongly, and the wind was words that said, <br />
&#8220;In brief thou shalt be answered. When the dead, <br />
Self-slaughtered, from the unready corse is torn, <br />
Then Minos, in the seventh gulf to mourn, <br />
Consigns it. Here on no set space it falls, <br />
But cast at random, and its roots it strikes <br />
In marsh or rock, and boughs and thorny spikes <br />
Grow upward. On its leaves the harpies feed, <br />
Tearing, and where the broken twiglets bleed <br />
Pain finds its outlet. <br />
When the trumpet calls, <br />
We all, with those who earthly flesh regain, <br />
Shall upward troop, but that our hand hath slain <br />
We may not enter, as is just. The Vale <br />
Of Judgment when we leave we each shall hale <br />
Our bodies slain behind us, till we reach <br />
The dismal thorns we left, and each on each <br />
Shall hang them. Every trunk of every shade <br />
Bent with the weight of that itself betrayed.&#8221;</p>
<p>We still were listening, lest more words should come <br />
From this sad spirit, when rose such noise anear <br />
That all the wailings of the woods were dumb <br />
Before it, and we paused, as those who hear <br />
The boar-hunt plunging through the brake, and nigh, <br />
Crashed boughs, and rush of beasts that chase and fly, <br />
Approaching where they stand; and forth there burst <br />
Two spirits torn and bare, and cried the first, <br />
&#8220;Befriend me, Death!&#8221; and cried the one behind, <br />
&#8220;Ah, Lano, swifter legs than mine ye show, <br />
But Toppo&#8217;s tourney found thy limbs more slow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereat he made no further pace, but low <br />
Crawled &#8216;neath the densest bush the woods contained, <br />
And the next instant, as the shade he gained, <br />
A rush of hell-hounds on his chase there came. <br />
Wild on the bush they leapt to trace and claim <br />
Their hiding victim, sinking fang and claw <br />
In him who squatted in its midst. They rent <br />
The writhing limbs, and diverse ways they went, <br />
Carrying the fragments that they tore. <br />
My guide <br />
Now led my steps the damaged bush beside, <br />
That loud lamented. Severed boughs we saw, <br />
And torn twigs bleeding. In its pain it made <br />
Protest, &#8220;Jacopo da Sant&#8217; Andrea! <br />
What gain was here to make my leaves thy shade? <br />
What condemnation for thy sins is mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>My Master questioned it, &#8220;Who art thou, say, <br />
So bruised and injured in a strife not thine?&#8221;</p>
<p>It answered, &#8220;Ye that some strange fate hath led <br />
To see me mangled and discomfited, <br />
I pray ye closely round my foot to lay <br />
The boughs and leaves their violence strawed away. <br />
In that fair city of the plain I dwelt <br />
Which once to Mars, its earliest patron, knelt, <br />
And then the Baptist in his place preferred, <br />
And earned thereby the war-god&#8217;s enmity. <br />
So that, except on Arno&#8217;s bridge there stands <br />
His statue yet, those men with useless hands <br />
Had toiled, from ashes of the Huns, again <br />
To build it in the years of Charlemagne.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no name: I have no tale to say. <br />
I made a gibbet of my house. Ye see <br />
The end in this, the doleful price I pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Canto XIV</p>
<p>
LOVE in my heart for that dear home of mine <br />
Compelled me. To the nameless Florentine <br />
I did the service that he asked. I laid <br />
The gathered twigs against his trunk. <br />
We left <br />
That grove of men, of human form bereft <br />
By their own violence, and before us lay <br />
A space so hateful that I shrank afraid, <br />
For surely none might cross it. <br />
Here, I say, <br />
The third sad circlet wide before us spread, <br />
A desert, by the dark wood garlanded, <br />
As that is belted by the boiling fosse. <br />
A desert which the hardiest might not cross <br />
Was here. The Libyan waste where Cato led <br />
The remnant of the host of Pompey, shows <br />
Dry sand alike, but oh, what heavier woes, <br />
Vengeance of God! what woes were here! Who boast <br />
They fear not Heaven, before that dreadful coast <br />
Have come not, or they would not doubt their dread! <br />
Strewn on the sands the naked souls I saw <br />
Lamenting loudly. Some by diverse law <br />
Lay flat: some crouched: some madly raced, and these, <br />
More numerous far, by milder cries conveyed <br />
A lesser torment than the souls that stayed <br />
Fixed on one spot. <br />
Upon that concourse dire <br />
Slow flakes were falling of dilated fire, <br />
Straight downward, as the Alpine snows descend, <br />
When no wind stirs the stillness. <br />
As there came <br />
From burning skies the separate flakes of flame <br />
Upon the host that Alexander led <br />
Across the torrid Indian plains &#8211; and they <br />
Stamped the red ashes lest they join and spread, <br />
And all be conflagration &#8211; so the heat <br />
Flaked downward in a slow unceasing sheet, <br />
On sand re-kindled with recruited fire, <br />
Like tinder that the flint and steel ignite. <br />
Here was the dance of woven hands I in vain <br />
That brushed aside the settling points of pain.</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;O thou, whom all these different hells <br />
Obey &#8211; save those gate-demons obdurate &#8211; <br />
Who yonder lies, whose fierce disdain repels <br />
The eternal doom, and with a heart as great <br />
As all his ruin, beneath the torturing rain <br />
Contorted, moves not, nor laments?&#8221; <br />
My guide <br />
I questioned, but the rebel shade replied, <br />
&#8220;Dead am I, but yet my living heart unslain <br />
Outequals Heaven. Though this relentless rain <br />
Fall ever; though Jove the toiling knave should tire <br />
From whom he snatched the bolt of previous fire <br />
That first transfixed me; though he tire alike <br />
All Etna&#8217;s smiths, there is no power to strike <br />
Shall make me quail. Let all His force employ, <br />
He shall not taste the fierce exultant joy <br />
To break me, suppliant.&#8221; <br />
I had yet to learn <br />
My guide&#8217;s hard voice, that in slow words and stern <br />
Made answer. &#8220;Think&#8217;st thou then, O Capaneus, <br />
Thy wrath makes answer to the wrath of Zeus? <br />
Or God regards it? But thy rageful pride, <br />
Against thee with the outer fires allied, <br />
Makes heavier torment for thy bane, and so <br />
Is penal only to thyself &#8211; Behold,&#8221; <br />
- With gentler voice again assumed, my guide <br />
Turned to me, as the sinner&#8217;s tale he told &#8211; <br />
&#8220;That lord, who once with six like kings was foe <br />
To Thebes, and sieged it. Then his boast, as now, <br />
That God he equalled. But his words avow <br />
The justice of his doom, and impotent <br />
Against regardless Heaven, they ornament <br />
His breast most fitly &#8211; Follow where I tread &#8211; <br />
- Avoid the sand.&#8221; <br />
With careful steps he led <br />
Along the margin of the mournful wood, <br />
And spake no more, until at length we stood <br />
Where-a thin river of most doleful red <br />
(I shudder, thinking), from the sighing trees <br />
Flowed outward. As the stream the harlots share <br />
Flows outward from beneath Bulicame, <br />
So this ran forward through the sand. Stone-bare <br />
Its bottom, stone its shelving sides, and grey <br />
The stony margins of its course. By these <br />
I judged that here we crossed the fiery plain <br />
Which else repelled us &#8211; But my guide again <br />
Was speaking. <br />
&#8220;Since the doleful gate ye passed, <br />
Which still for all creation, first and last, <br />
Stands wide, no sights of wonder seen compare <br />
With this slight stream, whose margins cold and bare <br />
No fires can vanquish, whose red waters quench <br />
Hell&#8217;s heat, and burn not.&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Master,&#8221; I desired, <br />
&#8220;For hunger wakened, grant the food required.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Far out in ocean lies an island waste <br />
Whose King, when once the early world was chaste, <br />
Ruled all men. In the midst a mountain lies, <br />
Ida, that once was fair to stormless skies, <br />
Peace of still nights and languorous noons it had, <br />
With murmuring leaves and falling waters glad <br />
(Cybele there the Heavenly Child concealed); <br />
Now lies it barer than a salted field, <br />
Than some outdated use more desolate, <br />
Abandoned, naked, in the change of fate.</p>
<p>&#8220;A giant of Eld within this mountain stands; <br />
From Damietta with rejecting hands <br />
He turns, and Romeward holds his eyes, as she <br />
Who in her mirror gazes fixedly. <br />
His head is all of purest gold: his breast <br />
And arms are silver of the finest test: <br />
Then all is brazen to the forking cleft: <br />
Iron is the right leg only, but the left <br />
Hath the foot also of the like: of clay <br />
The dexter foot, on which he leans alway. <br />
This giant throughout, except the golden head, <br />
Is cracked, and from the fissure tears are shed, <br />
And these sink downward through the rocks, until <br />
They reach Hell&#8217;s levels, and form the springs that fill <br />
The sunless gulf we passed of Acheron, <br />
And, draining thence, the Styx, and Phlegethon, <br />
Till downward by this straitened conduit passed <br />
Where all descent is ended, form at last <br />
The lake I tell not, for thine eyes shall see.&#8221; <br />
I asked him, &#8220;If this stream from hell to hell <br />
Descend continuous, I discern not well <br />
Why in the loftier circles nought I saw?&#8221;</p>
<p>He said, &#8220;As downward, tier by tier, we draw <br />
Toward the narrowing centre, still the bound <br />
We circle leftward, yet the slanting round <br />
Is incompleted; hence new sights to meet <br />
Ye must not marvel &#8221; <br />
&#8220;Master,&#8221; I replied, <br />
&#8220;One question more. Of Lethe nought ye say, <br />
Nor speak of Phlegethon. Across our way <br />
Comes either?&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Surely, in this scarlet tide <br />
The one flows past ye. But at Lethe&#8217;s side <br />
Thy feet shall stand in other air than this, <br />
For Lethe flows not through the lost abyss, <br />
But those repentant, from their guilt made free, <br />
Shall find it. &#8211; Follow boldly where I tread <br />
The stone. Not here the burning sand can spread; <br />
Nor the red rain molest from overhead.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Canto XV</p>
<p>
WE held the margin of the scarlet stream, <br />
The cold grey stones beneath our feet. A steam <br />
Arising from the water, overhead <br />
A canopy that roofed the causeway spread, <br />
Which quenched the fire descending. <br />
As the dyke <br />
From Bruges to Cadsand, where the burghers dread <br />
The arising tide, or as the bank alike <br />
The Paduans build in winter, to forbear <br />
The Brenta&#8217;s floods, when Chiarentana knows <br />
The feet of summer on the mountain snows, <br />
Such were the bulwarks of the stream, though less <br />
In height and thickness. <br />
Far that wilderness <br />
Of wailing boughs we left, till backward glance <br />
Had failed to find it. Once a troop we met <br />
That racing past us in their mournful dance <br />
Reversed, and sharply were their glances set <br />
To read us, as a tailor frowns to thread <br />
The needle, when long years of toil have <br />
The needed sight, or as men meeting peer <br />
At twilight, when the rising moon is thin.</p>
<p>Of these, one caught me by the skirt, and said, <br />
&#8220;O marvel!&#8221; and the face that heat had skimmed, <br />
I yet recalled, and answered, &#8220;Art thou here, <br />
My master?&#8221; <br />
He replied, &#8220;Brief words to win, <br />
I pray thee, O my son, consent that I <br />
Go backward somewhat with thee, while my kin <br />
Continue on the path we held.&#8221; <br />
I said, <br />
&#8220;I do not grant it, but beseech: and more, <br />
For those old days, when all thy learning&#8217;s store <br />
Was mine to pillage, if my guide permit, <br />
Sit will I with thee here some space.&#8221; <br />
But he <br />
Made answer, &#8220;Nay, for if we pause or sit, <br />
There must we for a hundred years remain, <br />
Powerless to writhe beneath the falling rain. <br />
But I will walk beside thy skirts as now, <br />
No farther than these penal laws allow, <br />
And then my station in our band resume, <br />
Who race, and wail our everlasting doom.&#8221;</p>
<p>I dared not from my higher stand descend, <br />
Nor might he to the causeway climb, and so <br />
I walked as those in humble prayer who bend, <br />
The while he paced the burning sand below.</p>
<p>He first enquired, &#8220;What chance or fate hath led <br />
Thy feet, before thy mortal loss, to tread <br />
A path so vacant?&#8221; <br />
&#8220;In mid-life,&#8221; I said, <br />
&#8220;I wandered in a pathless waste, and there, <br />
Refused of exit, in my last despair, <br />
I was returning to its midst, when he <br />
Who guides me came, and by this dreadful way <br />
Will bring me home at last.&#8221; <br />
And he to me, <br />
&#8220;I doubt it nought, for if thy destined star <br />
Perceived I rightly, when fair life and clear <br />
I with thee breathed, a different haven lay <br />
Before thee than this heat to which we steer, <br />
Who tempt High Heaven in all we speak and are. <br />
And but for death&#8217;s too soon determining, <br />
Mine aid had cheered thee in thy later spring.</p>
<p>&#8220;But those, the thankless and malign, who came <br />
To Florence from the rocks of Fiesole, <br />
Who mixed not with a nobler race than they, <br />
Still in their children hate thee, deed and name. <br />
Where the sour sorb-trees fruit, shall figs abound? <br />
Like are they even as our fathers found. <br />
Greed envy, hauteur, are the signs they show. <br />
Look that thou walk not in their ways. For though <br />
The path be stony for thy feet today, <br />
The time is near when in thy larger fame <br />
Both parties for thy potent aid shall pray. <br />
Then from the he-goat&#8217;s teeth the grass be far! <br />
But those thy kind, if any yet there be <br />
Surviving of the sacred Roman seed, <br />
Amidst the dense growth of the ranker weed, <br />
Let the Fiesolan beasts, the where they lie, <br />
Make their own litter for their natural sty.&#8221;</p>
<p>I answered, &#8220;Master, had it lain with me <br />
To choose my boon from Heaven, not where we are, <br />
But in the clear air of the world above, <br />
Thy words had guided. All my heart in love <br />
Returns toward thee, as my thoughts recall <br />
Thine image, patient, kind, beneficent, <br />
That taught me, tireless, hour by hour, in all, <br />
How by the growth of that which Heaven hath lent, <br />
Man wins to life immortal. While I live, <br />
In nought but words &#8211; and grateful words I give- <br />
Is still my power to thank thee. All you tell, <br />
Mind-treasured, with a text remembered well, <br />
I keep for One on whom I hope, that she <br />
May comment further, as shall surely be <br />
If her I reach hereafter. This I say <br />
Meantime, let Fortune at her worst of will, <br />
So conscience chide not, wreck my days: and still <br />
The boor his mattock&#8217;s baser laws obey.&#8221;</p>
<p>My leader heard me, and a backward glance <br />
Across his shoulder, to the right, he cast, <br />
To where we talked, and answered, &#8220;What ye say, <br />
Forget not in the days undawned.&#8221; <br />
But yet <br />
I questioned Ser Brunetto, &#8220;Tell me they <br />
Most famed on earth, who pay the godless debt <br />
In torment of this fiery rain at last?&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered, &#8220;Some there be ye well may know, <br />
But more that better should the world forget, <br />
And time for speech is shortened. Briefly, here <br />
Are clerks and scholars, all betrayed so low <br />
By one defiling. Priscian here must run. <br />
And of our city here Accorso&#8217;s son, <br />
Francesco. If such scurf thy mind admits, <br />
That base one of the Arno howling sits, <br />
Who, to Bacchiglione&#8217;s bank transferred, <br />
There left his sin-wrecked nerves. &#8211; But further word <br />
I may not. &#8211; Yonder in the distance see <br />
New smoke arising from the sandy waste. <br />
Fresh folk race on with whom I must not be. &#8211; <br />
Those writings mine by which on earth I live <br />
Remember. &#8211; More I ask not.&#8221; <br />
Here in haste <br />
He loosed my skirts, and turned, and seemed as they <br />
Who at Verona&#8217;s summer sports compete, <br />
Naked, across the fields with flying feet, <br />
To win the vesture green their speed to pay.</p>
<p>Canto XVI</p>
<p>
THE sandy plain was almost past. There rose <br />
Such noise as murmurs through the hive. For near <br />
We came to where the tainted water sheer <br />
Falls to the level of the fraudulent, <br />
The next sad circle. Ever past us went <br />
The flying bands beneath the fiery rain, <br />
Scattering the sharp tormenting flakes. Of those, <br />
Three runners from a troop dividing came, <br />
Who called me with one impulse, &#8220;Stranger, stay, <br />
Who by the garb hast found this dreadful way <br />
From our perverted city.&#8221; <br />
The searing flame <br />
Had baked their limbs, and in the hardened flesh <br />
New wounds were formed with every flake. Ah me <br />
Again in thought the piteous sight I see, <br />
And make their anguish mine. My guide the while <br />
Turned as they ran. &#8220;Wait here. For courtesy <br />
Deserve they from thyself, than theirs to thee <br />
More urgent. Only that the falling heat <br />
Forbids, thyself with greater haste should meet <br />
Their coming, than their own.&#8221; <br />
At that we paused, <br />
And when they saw it their arresting cry <br />
They ceased, and recommenced the general wail.</p>
<p>I might not reach them through the burning hail, <br />
Nor might they to the causeway climb, nor run <br />
Beside me, for the end was now so nigh, <br />
Nor might they, lest more grief the torture caused, <br />
Remain unmotioned in one place, and so <br />
They circled, as the nude, oiled champions go, <br />
Rotating, for the chance of grasp or blow <br />
Watchful, but these their eyes so held on me, <br />
That feet and neck perforce moved contrary, <br />
As round they wheeled. <br />
One hailed me first, &#8220;O thou, <br />
Whose living feet, as some strange powers allow, <br />
Resound among the shadows, if aught so base <br />
As we who bake in this unfertile place <br />
Thy mind regard, recall our earthly fame, <br />
And heed our plea to learn thy later name. <br />
He in whose footsteps I rotate, though now <br />
So peeled and bare, when in clear light, was he, <br />
Gualdrada&#8217;s grandson, who so nobly wrought <br />
In field and counsel both; the one ye see <br />
Who treads the sand behind, in all men&#8217;s thought <br />
Should still be fragrant, Aldobrandi he; <br />
And I, Jacopo Rusticucci. She, <br />
That savage wife an ill fate gave, has brought <br />
This misery on me.&#8221; <br />
Had some shelter shown <br />
To guard me from the slow unceasing rain, <br />
I had not shrunk to cross the heated plain, <br />
To greet them in their grief, whose names are known <br />
So highly, nor I think my Master&#8217;s voice <br />
Had chid me; but their aspects, baked and dried, <br />
Repelled and warned me. <br />
&#8220;Not contempt,&#8221; I cried, <br />
&#8220;But sorrow in my heart since first my guide <br />
Prepared me to expect such names, has grown, <br />
And will not leave me soon. Alike we own <br />
The same fair city, where your deeds today <br />
Are told not seldom, and true men rejoice <br />
Who hear them. From the bitter gall I go <br />
The fruit to find, and yet descend more low <br />
To Hell&#8217;s deep centre ere I climb.&#8221; <br />
He said, <br />
&#8220;Thy spirit long within thy members dwell, <br />
And fame behind thee shine! But speak I pray <br />
If valour quite and noble grace have fled <br />
From our loved city. For one, whose place in Hell <br />
Was filled but late, &#8211; with yonder troop he burns, <br />
Torments us largelier than the pain he learns, <br />
With tales of its befalling. Is there now <br />
Such dearth of honour, lifted once so high?&#8221; <br />
And my heart failed me for direct reply, <br />
But with uplifted face I cried, &#8220;O thou, <br />
My Florence! Not thy fallen tears are dry <br />
For plebeian strangers in thy halls, and pride <br />
And riot extolled, and honour crucified.&#8221;</p>
<p>And these that heard, their glances from me drew, <br />
And at each other gazed, as men that knew <br />
My confirmation, and divined it true.</p>
<p>At length they answered in one voice, &#8220;If there, <br />
As here, the truth unharmed thy lips may dare, <br />
Blest art thou! If from this unlighted air <br />
Again ye climb to where the stars are bare, <br />
When with rejoicing heart I once was there <br />
Thy thought looks backward, let thy words to men <br />
Exalt our names for that which late we were.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this they broke their giddy wheel, and then <br />
More swiftly than the heart could breathe Amen <br />
With legs like wings, across the sand they fled, <br />
And we went forward once again. <br />
So near <br />
The sound of waters now, I scarce could hear <br />
My leader&#8217;s voice. As that first stream to head <br />
From Monte Viso&#8217;s height a separate way <br />
Seaward, its quieter name and loftier bed <br />
Forgets at Forli, and in sheer descent <br />
Above San Benedetto&#8217;s towers resounds <br />
(There where a thousand in its wealthy bounds <br />
Might refuge, hindered by the sheltered few), <br />
So here the red stream to the nether pit <br />
Fell headlong, echoing through the void. <br />
I wore <br />
A cord girt round me (once I thought to snare <br />
That painted pard of which I spoke before, <br />
So noosed), and this my guide commanded me <br />
To loose, and reached it from me coiled, and there <br />
Far outward flung it in the blank abyss.</p>
<p>The blackness gulped it, while I thought, &#8220;From this, <br />
An act so strange, must spring new mystery, &#8211; <br />
How fixed he gazes where it sank, &#8211; and he, <br />
As though he heard me, answered. Ah, what care, <br />
What caution should we yield to Those who see <br />
Not the deed only, but the thought! <br />
He said, <br />
&#8220;I signalled That which rises while I speak, <br />
And makes thy question clear.&#8221; <br />
A man may dread <br />
Truth more than falsehood to his friends to speak, <br />
When truth than falsehood shows more wild, and weak <br />
Of proof is that he inly knows, but I <br />
Am barred from silence. Reader, truth I swear, <br />
By all my hope of fame this work shall bear, <br />
That slowly through the gross and fetid air <br />
A Shape swam upward. As the mariners see <br />
Their comrade rising from the depths, who dived <br />
An anchor tangled in the rocks to free, <br />
Against the brink the wingless bulk arrived.</p>
<p>
Canto XVII</p>
<p>
BEHOLD the reptile with the stinging tail, <br />
That mountains hold not, nor strong walls avail <br />
To bar, nor any weapons wound. Behold <br />
Him who diseases all the world with guile.&#8221;</p>
<p>So spake my guide, and to the monster signed <br />
To join us where the causeway ceased, and he, <br />
That shape of loathsome fraud, swam warily <br />
Landward, and rested there his bust, the while <br />
The undulations of his tail unrolled <br />
Trailed outward in the hollow dark behind.</p>
<p>His face was human, with a glance benign, <br />
Kindly, and just, and mild, but all beside <br />
Was reptile to the venomed fork. Two paws <br />
Were hairy to the armpits. Bright design <br />
And various colour patterned all his hide <br />
On breast and flank, in knots and circles drawn; <br />
Splendid as broidered cloths that mock the dawn, <br />
From Smyrna, or the looms of Tartary, <br />
Or those Arachne wove. <br />
As oft we see <br />
The wherries half afloat and half ashore, <br />
Or as the German beaver waits his prey, <br />
So on the brink the unclean monster lay, <br />
Which brims the desert with containing stone; <br />
The bust reposing, and the tail alone <br />
Still twisting, restless in the void: it bore <br />
A forked end, venomed as the scorpions are.</p>
<p>Then spake my guide, &#8220;Along the dreadful beach <br />
Now must we for a little space, to reach <br />
This shape malignant where it rests.&#8221; We went <br />
Down from the causeway on the right, and then <br />
Ten steps across the stony marge, that so <br />
Clear of the sand and fire our path should go <br />
Along the skirting of the void, and when <br />
We reached the monster, near at hand I knew <br />
Along the edge of sand and stone, a row <br />
Of sinners crouching. <br />
Here my Master said, <br />
&#8220;All kinds who suffer in this round to view, <br />
Before we leave it, mark their mien who sit <br />
Around the margin of the deeper pit. <br />
Go forward to them, but be brief. The while <br />
Converse I shortly with this beast of guile, <br />
That his broad shoulders bear us down.&#8221; <br />
Thereat <br />
Approached I to the doleful folk who sat <br />
Thus on the torture&#8217;s utmost bound. Their woe <br />
Was streaming from their eyes Above, below, <br />
With restless movements, like the dog that lies <br />
In summer, sleepless from the teasing flies, <br />
And turns, now here, now there, with snout and paw <br />
Smiting, so they with ceaseless hands and vain <br />
Brushed the hot sand, or flicked the burning rain.</p>
<p>From face to face I looked, but nought I saw <br />
Familiar, only that a purse there hung <br />
From every neck, of various prints, and each, <br />
The while they baked along the dismal beach, <br />
Gazed down, as though his sure salvation lay <br />
The emblazoned pouch within. <br />
The shades among, <br />
One gilded pouch an azure lion bore, <br />
And one of gules a white goose showed, but more, <br />
I paused at one who on a silver ground <br />
A pregnant sow gave azure, and thereon <br />
He looked, and growled, &#8220;What dost thou? Get thee gone. <br />
Thou art not of us. But since thy live return <br />
My word may carry, let the Paduans learn <br />
The place at my left side, that&#8217;s vacant now, <br />
Awaits Vitaliano.&#8221; Like a cow <br />
He writhed his mouth, and licked his nose, and said, <br />
&#8220;Of Padua I; but these are Florentines <br />
Around me. Oft they din my ears and cry, <br />
We wait the sovereign cavalier, who shines <br />
In silver. He shall bear the he goats red <br />
Upon the pouch that decks his throat.&#8221; <br />
But I <br />
Would wait no longer, lest my guide were wroth, <br />
And left these dolorous souls, pain-wearied now, <br />
Beneath their burden of eternity, <br />
While backward to the beast I went. <br />
His haunch <br />
My guide had climbed, and now to venture forth <br />
He called me likewise. &#8220;Here I mount, that thou <br />
Shalt ride before me; so the swinging tail, <br />
More distant from thy fears, when out we launch, <br />
Shall steer us downward. Here no steadier stair <br />
Avails, but through the empty dark we sail. <br />
Be bold, and fear not. For the fetid air <br />
Shall bear us safely.&#8221; <br />
As the man that fears <br />
The nearing ague, pale and shivering stands, <br />
Already gazing on a bloodless nail, <br />
Not strengthful even to leave the harmful shade, <br />
Was I that heard. But yet with trembling hands <br />
(As some poor knave his craven heart conceals, <br />
Emboldened by his master&#8217;s calm), I made <br />
My passage to the shoulders broad. I tried <br />
For words in which to beg my gentle guide <br />
To lend his arm, but no sound came, and he, <br />
Who knew my thoughts, and aided all, thereon <br />
Reached round me while he ordered, &#8211; &#8220;Geryon, <br />
Now start, and widely be thy circles spread, <br />
And slow thy sinking.&#8221; As the wherries slide <br />
Downward and backward to the waiting tide, <br />
So slid the monster from the bank, until, <br />
Launched in free space, he outward turned his head <br />
To face the void, and like an eel his tail <br />
Was twisting, and his paws outreached to fill <br />
With gathered air. <br />
Did greater fears assail <br />
When Pha&euml;thon let the loose reins fall, that they <br />
Were trailed through heaven, and burnt the Milky Way? <br />
Or when Icarus felt the wax divide <br />
From feathered loins, the while his father cried, <br />
Far under, Evil road is thine? No sight <br />
Was left me, save the beast I rode. The night <br />
Was hollow where he swam. I might not know <br />
That sank we, saving that the wind below <br />
Beat upward, and against my face it blew <br />
As round we wheeled in gradual loops. I knew, <br />
Right-hand, the thunder of the whirlpool rise, <br />
And outward stretched my head, with downward eyes, <br />
And then shrank backward in more fear, for high <br />
Through the gross darkness pierced a wailing cry, <br />
And flickering lights were far beneath, whereby <br />
I learnt our height, and by these sights aware <br />
Of how we wheeled, and in what space of air, <br />
And how descending, colder fear I knew.</p>
<p>But as the falcon, soaring long in vain, <br />
Wing-wearied, stoops to reach the empty plain, <br />
Though neither bird nor lure attract, the while <br />
The falconer cries Alas I and winging slow <br />
Disdainful, sullen, not for bait or guile <br />
Is lured, but from his master sulks, &#8211; below <br />
The ragged rocks at last, this Geryon, <br />
By us defeated of his customed freight, <br />
Alit, but lightened of my earthly weight <br />
Like arrow from the loosened string was gone.</p>
<p>
Canto XVIII</p>
<p>
Now stood we in the utter depth of Hell, <br />
For here ten trenches, with a central well, <br />
Contain all traitors in their kinds. The wall <br />
Is iron-grey stone that rings it round, and all <br />
Its floors and bastions are alike. Its name <br />
Is Malebolge. In this central shame <br />
There lie ten moats that like a tenfold chain <br />
Circle the wide and deep and dreadful well <br />
That midmost sinks, &#8211; but in its place I tell <br />
That horror. <br />
As succeeding moats begird <br />
A fortress, so, between the outer wall <br />
And central shaft, the ten great chasms extend <br />
In which the sin-divided traitors herd, <br />
And as such moats are bridged, so cliffs remain <br />
Connecting bank to bank, converging all <br />
Where, at the margin of the pit, they end.</p>
<p>By the first fosse we stood, when Geryon shook <br />
His back in anger from my weight, and shot <br />
Upward again for his familiar prey. <br />
My guide, left-hand, beneath the rampart took <br />
narrow path the ditch that edged, to find <br />
The nearest crossing. In his steps behind <br />
I walked, nor spared upon my right to look <br />
Down on the crowd that filled the trench. Their lot <br />
Revealed new torments, and new griefs, for they <br />
Had live tormentors for their bane, unlike <br />
The circles past. <br />
Beneath the demons&#8217; ban <br />
All-naked here in two great crowds they ran, <br />
In opposite ways. For close beneath the dyke <br />
The advancing concourse faced us all, but those <br />
Lined in the further rank beside us moved, <br />
Though livelier-motioned. <br />
As at Rome were seen <br />
The pilgrims in the year of Jubilee <br />
Divided on the bridge, &#8211; one crowd was sent <br />
Toward St. Peter&#8217;s, one reversed that went <br />
Toward Giordano, &#8211; so these shades I see <br />
Herded. Behind them demons, horned and hooved, <br />
With swinging scourges move. Their backs are grooved <br />
And whealed with beating where the thongs have been. <br />
Ah, how the first cut lifts their legs! Not one <br />
That waits a second stroke to make him run.</p>
<p>As on we passed, a sinner stayed mine eye <br />
Whose face familiar seemed. With bended head <br />
He shunned my gaze, but to my guide I said, <br />
&#8220;One was there in the troop that passed us by <br />
Already that my sight had known.&#8221; Thereat <br />
He paused not only, but in courtesy <br />
Some steps allowed me to return, that I <br />
Might question whom I sought; and when we found <br />
That hiding shade I cried aloud, &#8220;O thou! <br />
In vain that wouldst, with careful glance on ground, <br />
Avoid, except that features feigned ye wear, <br />
I know ye, Venedico. What curst prank <br />
Hath cast thee pickling in so foul a tank?&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered, sullen, &#8220;Nought I seek to tell, <br />
But thy clear speech, that through the murk of Hell, <br />
With recollection of the former air, <br />
Resounds so strangely, all compels. I run <br />
For no gained greed or spoil my lust had won. <br />
Persuasions only brought my bane. I weep <br />
That fair Ghisola shared the Marquis&#8217; sleep <br />
By my contriving. That the truth, whate&#8217;er <br />
The aspect that a viler tale may wear <br />
In lips of gossip. Tell the Bolognese <br />
It is not only I that run with these <br />
From our false city. They crowd more numerous <br />
Than all the infant tongues on earth today <br />
That Sipa in their speech are taught to say, <br />
Between the Reno and the Savena. <br />
Alone and pregnant. For that guilt to pay <br />
He runs, and Medea weights his doom. All they <br />
Whose hidden lives the like deceit confess <br />
In this direction race. But longer stay <br />
Deserves not. Pass we to the further trench.&#8221;</p>
<p>The narrow path ran on, and somewhat sank, <br />
But arching where it bridged the chasms. <br />
A stench <br />
Assailed us as we neared the next, beyond <br />
The vapour cast from any stagnant pond <br />
Of earth&#8217;s excretions, scent and sight alike <br />
Assailing. Moaning from the depth arose, <br />
And gasping, and the noise of beating hands. <br />
The banks were caked with filth the vapour left <br />
In rolling upward from the dismal cleft, <br />
Which sinks so deep that he alone who stands <br />
On the mid archway of the bridge can see <br />
Its hidden baseness. There, with useless blows, <br />
I saw the wallowing crowd of culprits strike <br />
The flowing filth from off their mouths. A head <br />
Was there so soiled, I looked in doubt if he <br />
Were priest or layman, till in wrath he bawled, <br />
&#8220;Why dost thou scan me in my filthiness? <br />
I am not soaking in a different mess <br />
From those around me.&#8221; <br />
In return I called, <br />
&#8220;Because I knew thee when thy hair was dry. <br />
If rightly through thy present dirt I guess <br />
Thou art Alessio.&#8221; <br />
Striving still to clear <br />
His head, that like a rotten pumpkin showed, <br />
He answered, &#8220;Yea, my flatteries brought me here. <br />
Fair words alone have filled this dismal road.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then spake my guide, &#8220;Look further out, for she, <br />
That fouled sprawled harlot, whom in vain you see <br />
Scrape off the filth with filthy nails, and try, <br />
Now crouching at the side, now straining high, <br />
To avoid the deluge of the dung, on earth <br />
Was Thais, whose sweet tongue her lovers&#8217; worth <br />
Exalted past her own. But longer stay <br />
This trench deserves not, nor a look&#8217;s delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Canto XIX</p>
<p>
O SIMON MAGUS! O ye pestilent! <br />
Followers and thieves of him; who prostitute <br />
For gold and silver things divine I Lament, <br />
For here is your abiding. Here for you <br />
The trumpet sounds damnation. Here I stand <br />
On the third arch, by which your trench is spanned, <br />
And what behold I? Heaven and earth unite <br />
With these dark horrors, O Wisdom infinite! <br />
To show the balance of thy scales is true.</p>
<p>Smooth on each wall the livid stone was dressed, <br />
And pierced with holes, as where the martins nest, <br />
But larger, and the stony floor contained <br />
Round holes alike, in size and shape the same <br />
As in my beauteous San Giovanni <br />
The stands for the baptizers. Lately one <br />
I broke to save a drowning life: let none <br />
Revile me with an altered tale. There came <br />
From out each hole two legs: the rest remained <br />
Housed in the rock. The soles unceasingly <br />
Burned, and the legs, that to the calf were bare, <br />
So strained and kicked that any rope had burst <br />
That held them. On the soles of these accurst <br />
Bright flames that licked the outer surface were; <br />
As on things oiled, they moved from heel to toe, <br />
Flickering and dancing. <br />
&#8220;Master, show the name <br />
Of him whose legs from out the flood I see, <br />
That twist and writhe and strain more furiously <br />
Than all beside, and licked by livelier flame?&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered, &#8220;Somewhat if we leave the bridge, <br />
And sideways follow the dividing ridge, <br />
This fosse that severs from the next below, <br />
There is a passage in the wall, too steep <br />
For any human feet or hands to go, <br />
But I will bear thee, if thou wilt, and so <br />
Himself shall tell thee why so strongly leap <br />
His fire-licked members.&#8221; <br />
I replied, &#8220;Thy will <br />
Is mine, thou knowest. For if my voice were still, <br />
My mind were naked to thy thought.&#8221; <br />
Left-hand <br />
We turned along the lower boundary, <br />
And here my Master bore me down, until <br />
Upon the perforated flood to stand <br />
He set me safely. Where he placed me down <br />
I saw the lamentable legs of him <br />
Who writhed so hardly. <br />
&#8220;Whosoe&#8217;er thou be, <br />
Who hast thy body thus reversed,&#8221; I cried, <br />
&#8220;Save by thy doom the power of speech has died, <br />
Unhappy, answer!&#8221; As the friar must bend, <br />
Confessing him who in his grave is penned, <br />
For some perfidious murder judged to die <br />
Head downwards; who, to more his fate extend, <br />
Prolongs confession, while the spades delay, <br />
So to the entrance of the hole did I <br />
Stoop down, and upward rose a voice, &#8220;Art here <br />
Already, Boniface? Before the year <br />
The writ foretold me? Hast thou tired so soon <br />
Of that dear wealth which was the tempting boon <br />
For which thou didst the Bride of Christ betray? <br />
- Won by deceit, and cast in spoils away.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I stood wildered, till my Master said, <br />
&#8220;Delay not thy reply, I am not he <br />
Whom thou believest.&#8221; <br />
This I called, whereon <br />
The spirit madly wrenched his feet, and cried <br />
With weeping voice, &#8220;Then what concern with me <br />
Thy steps to this unholy place has led? <br />
By that Great Mantle from my shoulders gone, <br />
The She-bear whelped me, and her cubs I tried <br />
To feed and foster, and exalt their pride. <br />
Much gold I pursed, and straitly pursed am I; <br />
And here I wait until the next shall die <br />
And take my place, and in that joyful hour <br />
I join the earlier of our kind, acower <br />
Beneath the fissures of the stones that lie.</p>
<p>&#8220;But more already have I baked,&#8221; he said, <br />
&#8220;And longer stood on my inverted head, <br />
Than he that follows in my place shall know. <br />
There comes a shepherd from the West. Bordeaux <br />
Shall give the Church a viler lord than he <br />
And I together in our deeds should be. <br />
For like that Jason of the Maccabees <br />
Who bought God&#8217;s church, and bent his heathen knees <br />
To alien altars, shall he prove, and so, <br />
As to his guilt his king complaisant showed, <br />
The king of France shall take that impious road.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know not if I spoke too foolish-bold <br />
But in this strain I answered, &#8220;Say what gold <br />
Our Lord from Peter for His keys required? <br />
Or by Matthias next was Peter hired <br />
To yield that office that the guilty lost? <br />
But justly dost thou pay the penal cost <br />
Of thy betrayal. Keep that golden fee <br />
That made thee false to Charles of Sicily <br />
As best thou mayst. And but those Keys revered, <br />
Which in glad life thy hands have turned, repress <br />
Mine heart s indignant wrath, the nakedness <br />
Of all thou wast, my harder words should say. <br />
For avarice in thy Seat its guilt hath scared <br />
Upon the conscience of mankind. It treads <br />
The just man downward, and exalts the base. <br />
A wrath foreshown by that Evangelist <br />
Who saw the harlot with the seven heads <br />
And the ten horns, who kept her virtuous place, <br />
Pleasing her spouse, until the kings she kissed <br />
In acts of fornication. Gods to you <br />
Are gold and silver. In your eyes they shine <br />
Deities a hundred, while the idolater, <br />
That in your pride you excommunicate, <br />
To one false god bends only. Constantine! <br />
What countless evils through the years accrue, <br />
Not that thou lovedst God&#8217;s spouse, but gave to her <br />
A wealth unseemly for her lowly state.&#8221;</p>
<p>As thus mine indignation spake, below <br />
If conscience waked or rage I may not know, <br />
But wild and furious sprawled his feet. My guide <br />
I glanced at, fearful lest his looks should chide, <br />
And faced assent. Again he lifted me, <br />
And by that path the boldest goat had shunned, <br />
He bore me to the crossway back. Beneath, <br />
The fifth great cleft gave other woes to see.</p>
<p>
Canto XX</p>
<p>
ANOTHER valley in its turn I tell. <br />
Another guilt, another depth of hell, <br />
Extends beneath. The great trench circular <br />
We gazed on from the crossing arch, and far <br />
I saw that silent weeping crowd and slow <br />
That moves around it, as the chanters go <br />
In earthly process of the Litanies. <br />
But other cause for shortened steps have these, <br />
For when my distant glance I dropped more low <br />
On those beneath, an unfamiliar woe <br />
They showed, neck-twisted where the body joins, <br />
Till each his own and not his neighbour&#8217;s loins <br />
Could gaze on while he walked, and for this cause <br />
They needs went backwards. Some by Nature&#8217;s laws <br />
Distorting palsies so may wrench, but I <br />
Have seen nought like it, nor believe the sky <br />
Looks down on such contortion. <br />
Ye who read <br />
- God give ye vintage of the words ye heed &#8211; <br />
Reflect how I, who watched our human seed <br />
So altered and debased, with visage dry <br />
Could watch them. They of heavenly form bereft <br />
So far, that where the hinder parts are cleft <br />
The tears rolled down them as they wept, and I, <br />
Whose eyes thereat with kindred tears were wet, <br />
Bowed down upon the cold stone parapet, <br />
And wept beyond controlling. <br />
But my guide <br />
Spake sharply. &#8220;Art thou of those fools,&#8221; he said, <br />
&#8220;Whose pity liveth where it best were dead? <br />
For what more impious than the thought that dares <br />
Beyond man&#8217;s province, and in fancy shares <br />
The mind of the Creator? Raise thine head. <br />
Look up! For near us is Amyhiara&uuml;s <br />
For whom Hell gaped. The wondering Thebans cried, <br />
&#8216;Why dost thou leave the war? Why hasten thus <br />
Thy chariot horses down the steep?&#8217; But he <br />
Nor paused, nor turned, till Minos&#8217; seat before <br />
He stayed and trembled. Not this guise he wore <br />
In that proud kinghood of his fame. Dost see <br />
How loth his shoulders form his breast? He thought <br />
To see far forward. Now his limbs are taught <br />
To bear him backward. Next Tiresias, <br />
Who smote too boldly with his sorcerous rod <br />
The entangled snakes, and found his limbs transform <br />
To woman&#8217;s comelier contours, soft and warm; <br />
Which aspect lasted till he smote again <br />
The twisted dealers of the earlier bane. <br />
The next is Aruns who, in Luni&#8217;s hills, <br />
Whereunder toil the Carrarese for bread, <br />
Cave-couched amidst the marble; all the ills <br />
That lay fore-fated in the thought of God, <br />
He sought to read from unobstructed seas, <br />
Or where the night her starry legions led. <br />
Now walks he backward for his wage. With these <br />
Observe that body with the wry-necked head <br />
That onward shuffles, while her hair is spread <br />
Upon the breasts we see not. Bear with me <br />
A little while I tell. For here is she, <br />
Manto, who after her long wandering <br />
Found roothold in my native place. Her sire <br />
Died, and the city of the Bacchic rites <br />
Groaned to the scourging of an alien king, <br />
And she went forth. In northern Italy <br />
Where the wild Tyrol bars the German mire, <br />
The hills are hollowed. Like an inland sea <br />
The lake of Garda lies. A thousand streams <br />
Flash foaming downward from the Alpine heights <br />
From Garda to the Val Camonica <br />
To feed it, till the basin brims, and then <br />
Flows over at a point where all the sees, <br />
Trentine and Brescian and Veronese, <br />
Unite, that all their passing priests it seems <br />
Might bless the men that dwell there. Builded strong, <br />
To tame the Brescian and the Bergamese, <br />
That truth I hear. But wilt thou bear with me <br />
That backward turns my mind to these that move <br />
In that sad process underneath?&#8221; <br />
He said: <br />
&#8220;Regard thou him whose dusky shoulders spread <br />
His weight of beard. A Grecian augur he <br />
When Greece so empty of its males became <br />
That scarce the cradles held them. Aulis heard <br />
Eurypilus and Calchas speak the word <br />
That loosed the cables of their ships. The tale <br />
I told before in my great tragedy, <br />
As well thou knowest. And here Eurypilus <br />
Beneath thee moves. The next is Michael Scot, <br />
Lean-flanked, who could by magic artistry <br />
Against the demons&#8217; subtlest wiles prevail. <br />
Guido Bonatti comes behind, and next <br />
Asdente weeps that his vain mind forgot <br />
His bench and leather. Mark those crones unsexed <br />
That follow. Witchcraft with their waxen dolls <br />
And mystic herbs they wrought, and left therefor <br />
The seemly ordered life which Heaven extols, <br />
The loom and needle. But the time permits <br />
No more to tarry. Come! The western wave <br />
At Seville yields the moon her watery grave. <br />
Full was she two days since, that late ye saw <br />
So thinly crescent in the pathless wood.&#8221; <br />
We left them, twisted in their sorcerous pits, <br />
Conversing as we onward walked, until <br />
We reached the shadow of a darker ill, <br />
When gazing down the fifth black chasm we stood.</p>
