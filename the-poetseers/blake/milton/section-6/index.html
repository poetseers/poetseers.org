MILTON: BOOK THE SECOND</p>
<p>There is a place where Contrarieties are equally True<br />
&#8220;This place is called Beulah, It is a pleasant lovely Shadow&#8221;<br />
Where no dispute can come. Because of those who Sleep.<br />
Into this place the Sons &amp; Daughters of Ololon descended<br />
With solemn mourning into Beulahs moony shades &amp; hills<br />
Weeping for Milton: mute wonder held the Daughters of Beulah<br />
Enrapturd with affection sweet and mild benevolence</p>
<p>Beulah is evermore Created around Eternity; appearing<br />
&#8220;To the Inhabitants of Eden, around them on all sides.&#8221;<br />
But Beulah to its Inhabitants appears within each district<br />
As the beloved infant in his mothers bosom round incircled<br />
With arms of love &amp; pity &amp; sweet compassion. But to<br />
&#8220;The Sons of Eden the moony habitations of Beulah,&#8221;<br />
Are from Great Eternity a mild &amp; pleasant Rest.</p>
<p>And it is thus Created. Lo the Eternal Great Humanity<br />
To whom be Glory &amp; Dominion Evermore Amen<br />
Walks among all his awful Family see in every face<br />
As the breath of the Almighty. such are the words of man to man<br />
&#8220;In the great Wars of Eternity, in fury of Poetic Inspiration,&#8221;<br />
To build the Universe stupendous: Mental forms Creating</p>
<p>&#8220;But the Emanations trembled exceedingly, nor could they&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Live, because the life of Man was too exceeding unbounded&#8221;<br />
His joy became terrible to them they trembled &amp; wept<br />
Crying with one voice. Give us a habitation &amp; a place<br />
In which we may be hidden under the shadow of wings<br />
&#8220;For if we who are but for a time, &amp; who pass away in winter&#8221;<br />
Behold these wonders of Eternity we shall consume<br />
&#8220;But you O our Fathers &amp; Brothers, remain in Eternity&#8221;</p>
<p>But grant us a Temporal Habitation. do you speak<br />
To us; we will obey your words as you obey Jesus<br />
The Eternal who is blessed for ever &amp; ever. Amen</p>
<p>So spake the lovely Emanations; &amp; there appeard a pleasant<br />
&#8220;Mild Shadow above: beneath: &amp; on all sides round,&#8221;</p>
<p>Into this pleasant Shadow all the weak &amp; weary<br />
Like Women &amp; Children were taken away as on wings<br />
&#8220;Of dovelike softness, &amp; shadowy habitations prepared for them&#8221;<br />
But every Man returnd &amp; went still going forward thro&#8217;<br />
The Bosom of the Father in Eternity on Eternity<br />
Neither did any lack or fall into Error without<br />
A Shadow to repose in all the Days of happy Eternity</p>
<p>&#8220;Into this pleasant Shadow Beulah, all Ololon descended&#8221;<br />
And when the Daughters of Beulah heard the lamentation<br />
&#8220;All Beulah wept, for they saw the Lord coming in the Clouds&#8221;<br />
And the Shadows of Beulah terminate in rocky Albion.</p>
<p>And all Nations wept in affliction Family by Family<br />
Germany wept towards France &amp; Italy: England wept &amp; trembled<br />
Towards America: India rose up from his golden bed:<br />
As one awakend in the night: they saw the Lord coming<br />
In the Clouds of Ololon with Power &amp; Great Glory!</p>
<p>&#8220;And all the Living Creatures of the Four Elements, wail&#8217;d&#8221;<br />
With bitter wailing: these in the aggregate are named Satan<br />
&#8220;And Rahab: they know not of Regeneration, but only of Generation&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The Fairies, Nymphs, Gnomes &amp; Genii of the Four Elements&#8221;<br />
Unforgiving &amp; unalterable: these cannot be Regenerated<br />
&#8220;But must be Created, for they know only of Generation&#8221;<br />
These are the Gods of the Kingdoms of the Earth: in contrarious<br />
&#8220;And cruel opposition: Element against Element, opposed in War&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Not Mental, as the Wars of Eternity, but a Corporeal Strife&#8221;<br />
In Los&#8217;s Halls continual labouring in the Furnaces of Golgonooza<br />
Orc howls on the Atlantic: Enitharmon trembles: All Beulah weeps</p>
<p>Thou hearest the Nightingale begin the Song of Spring;<br />
The Lark sitting upon his earthy bed: just as the morn<br />
Appears; listens silent; then springing from the waving Corn-field! loud<br />
&#8220;He leads the Choir of Day! trill, trill, trill, trill,&#8221;<br />
Mounting upon the wings of light into the Great Expanse:<br />
Reecchoing against the lovely blue &amp; shining heavenly Shell:<br />
His little throat labours with inspiration; every feather<br />
On throat &amp; breast &amp; wings vibrates with the effluence Divine<br />
All Nature listens silent to him &amp; the awful Sun<br />
Stands still upon the Mountain looking on this little Bird</p>
<p>&#8220;With eyes of soft humility, &amp; wonder love &amp; awe.&#8221;<br />
Then loud from their green covert all the Birds begin their Song<br />
&#8220;The Thrush, the Linnet &amp; the Goldfinch, Robin &amp; the Wren&#8221;<br />
Awake the Sun from his sweet reverie upon the Mountain:<br />
&#8220;The Nightingale again assays his song, &amp; thro the day,&#8221;<br />
And thro the night warbles luxuriant; every Bird of Song<br />
Attending his loud harmony with admiration &amp; love.<br />
This is a Vision of the lamentation of Beulah over Ololon!</p>
<p>Thou percievest the Flowers put forth their precious Odours!<br />
And none can tell how from so small a center comes such sweets<br />
Forgetting that within that Center Eternity expands<br />
&#8220;Its ever during doors, that Og &amp; Anak fiercely guard[.]&#8220;<br />
First eer the morning breaks joy opens in the flowery bosoms<br />
&#8220;Joy even to tears, which the Sun rising dries; first the Wild Thyme&#8221;<br />
And Meadow-sweet downy &amp; soft waving among the reeds.<br />
Light springing on the air lead the sweet Dance: they wake<br />
The Honeysuckle sleeping on the Oak: the flaunting beauty<br />
Revels along upon the wind; the White-thorn lovely May<br />
Opens her many lovely eyes: listening the Rose still sleeps t243<br />
None dare to wake her. soon she bursts her crimson curtaind bed<br />
And comes forth in the majesty of beauty; every Flower:<br />
&#8220;The Pink, the Jessamine, the Wall-flower, the Carnation&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The Jonquil, the mild Lilly opes her heavens! every Tree,&#8221;<br />
And Flower &amp; Herb soon fill the air with an innumerable Dance<br />
&#8220;Yet all in order sweet &amp; lovely, Men are sick with Love!&#8221;<br />
Such is a Vision of the lamentation of Beulah over Ololon</p>
<p>And Milton oft sat up on the Couch of Death &amp; oft conversed<br />
In vision &amp; dream beatific with the Seven Angels of the Presence</p>
<p>I have turned my back upon these Heavens builded on cruelty<br />
My Spectre still wandering thro&#8217; them follows my Emanation<br />
He hunts her footsteps thro&#8217; the snow &amp; the wintry hail &amp; rain<br />
The idiot Reasoner laughs at the Man of Imagination<br />
And from laughter proceeds to murder by undervaluing calumny</p>
<p>Then Hillel who is Lucifer replied over the Couch of Death<br />
And thus the Seven Angels instructed him &amp; thus they converse.</p>
<p>We are not Individuals but States: Combinations of Individuals<br />
We were Angels of the Divine Presence: &amp; were Druids in Annandale<br />
&#8220;Compelld to combine into Form by Satan, the Spectre of Albion,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Who made himself a God &amp;, destroyed the Human Form Divine. [Hebrew text]&#8220;<br />
But the Divine Humanity &amp; Mercy gave us a Human Form as multitudes<br />
Because we were combind in Freedom &amp; holy Brotherhood Vox Populi t245</p>
<p>While those combind by Satans Tyranny first in the blood of War<br />
&#8220;And Sacrifice &amp;, next, in Chains of imprisonment: are Shapeless Rocks&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Retaining only Satans Mathematic Holiness, Length: Bredth &amp; Highth&#8221;<br />
Calling the Human Imagination: which is the Divine Vision &amp; Fruition<br />
&#8220;In which Man liveth eternally: madness &amp; blasphemy, against&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Its own Qualities, which are Servants of Humanity, not Gods or Lords[.]&#8220;<br />
Distinguish therefore States from Individuals in those States.<br />
States Change: but Individual Identities never change nor cease:<br />
You cannot go to Eternal Death in that which can never Die.<br />
Satan &amp; Adam are States Created into Twenty-seven Churches<br />
And thou O Milton art a State about to be Created<br />
Called Eternal Annihilation that none but the Living shall<br />
Dare to enter: &amp; they shall enter triumphant over Death<br />
&#8220;And Hell &amp; the Grave! States that are not, but ah! Seem to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judge then of thy Own Self: thy Eternal Lineaments explore<br />
What is Eternal &amp; what Changeable? &amp; what Annihilable!</p>
<p>The Imagination is not a State: it is the Human Existence itself<br />
&#8220;Affection or Love becomes a State, when divided from Imagination&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The Memory is a State always, &amp; the Reason is a State&#8221;<br />
Created to be Annihilated &amp; a new Ratio Created<br />
Whatever can be Created can be Annihilated Forms cannot<br />
&#8220;The Oak is cut down by the Ax, the Lamb falls by the Knife&#8221;<br />
&#8220;But their Forms Eternal Exist, For-ever. Amen Halle[l]ujah&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus they converse with the Dead watching round the Couch of Death.<br />
For God himself enters Death&#8217;s Door always with those that enter<br />
&#8220;And lays down in the Grave with them, in Visions of Eternity&#8221;<br />
Till they awake &amp; see Jesus &amp; the Linen Clothes lying<br />
&#8220;That the Females had Woven for them, &amp; the Gates of their Fathers House&#8221;</p>
<p>And the Divine Voice was heard in the Songs of Beulah Saying</p>
<p>&#8220;When I first Married you, I gave you all my whole Soul&#8221;<br />
I thought that you would love my loves &amp; joy in my delights<br />
Seeking for pleasures in my pleasures O Daughter of Babylon<br />
&#8220;Then thou wast lovely, mild &amp; gentle. now thou art terrible&#8221;<br />
&#8220;In jealousy &amp; unlovely in my sight, because thou hast cruelly&#8221;<br />
Cut off my loves in fury till I have no love left for thee<br />
Thy love depends on him thou lovest &amp; on his dear loves<br />
Depend thy pleasures which thou hast cut off by jealousy<br />
Therefore I shew my jealousy &amp; set before you Death.<br />
Behold Milton descended to Redeem the Female Shade</p>
<p>&#8220;From Death Eternal; such your lot, to be continually Redeem&#8217;d&#8221;<br />
By death &amp; misery of those you love &amp; by Annihilation<br />
When the Sixfold Female percieves that Milton annihilates<br />
Himself: that seeing all his loves by her cut off: he leaves<br />
Her also: intirely abstracting himself from Female loves<br />
She shall relent in fear of death: She shall begin to give<br />
Her maidens to her husband: delighting in his delight<br />
And then &amp; then alone begins the happy Female joy<br />
&#8220;As it is done in Beulah, &amp; thou O Virgin Babylon Mother of Whoredoms&#8221;<br />
Shalt bring Jerusalem in thine arms in the night watches; and<br />
No longer turning her a wandering Harlot in the streets<br />
Shalt give her into the arms of God your Lord &amp; Husband.</p>
<p>Such are the Songs of Beulah in the Lamentations of Ololon</p>
<p>And all the Songs of Beulah sounded comfortable notes<br />
&#8220;To comfort Ololons lamentation, for they said[:]&#8220;<br />
Are you the Fiery Circle that late drove in fury &amp; fire<br />
The Eight Immortal Starry-Ones down into Ulro dark<br />
Rending the Heavens of Beulah with your thunder &amp; lightnings<br />
And can you thus lament &amp; can you pity &amp; forgive?<br />
Is terror changd to pity O wonder of Eternity!</p>
<p>&#8220;And the Four States of Humanity in its Repose,&#8221;<br />
Were shewed them. First of Beulah a most pleasant Sleep<br />
&#8220;On Couches soft, with mild music, tended by Flowers of Beulah&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Sweet Female forms, winged or floating in the air spontaneous&#8221;<br />
The Second State is Alla &amp; the third State Al-Ulro;<br />
But the Fourth State is dreadful; it is named Or-Ulro:<br />
&#8220;The First State is in the Head, the Second is in the Heart:&#8221;<br />
The Third in the Loins &amp; Seminal Vessels &amp; the Fourth<br />
&#8220;In the Stomach &amp; Intestines terrible, deadly, unutterable&#8221;<br />
And he whose Gates are opend in those Regions of his Body<br />
Can from those Gates view all these wondrous Imaginations</p>
<p>But Ololon sought the Or-Ulro &amp; its fiery Gates<br />
And the Couches of the Martyrs: &amp; many Daughters of Beulah<br />
Accompany them down to the Ulro with soft melodious tears<br />
A long journey &amp; dark thro Chaos in the track of Miltons course<br />
To where the Contraries of Beulah War beneath Negations Banner</p>
<p>Then view&#8217;d from Miltons Track they see the Ulro: a vast Polypus<br />
Of living fibres down into the Sea of Time &amp; Space growing<br />
A self-devouring monstrous human Death Twenty-seven fold<br />
Within it sit Five Females &amp; the nameless Shadowy Mother<br />
Spinning it from their bowels with songs of amorous delight<br />
And melting cadences that lure the Sleepers of Beulah down<br />
The River Storge (which is Arnon) into the Dead Sea:<br />
Around this Polypus Los continual builds the Mundane Shell</p>
<p>Four Universes round the Universe of Los remain Chaotic<br />
&#8220;Four intersecting Globes, &amp; the Egg form&#8217;d World of Los&#8221;<br />
&#8220;In midst; stretching from Zenith to Nadir, in midst of Chaos.&#8221;<br />
One of these Ruind Universes is to the North named Urthona<br />
One to the South this was the glorious World of Urizen<br />
&#8220;One to the East, of Luvah: One to the West; of Tharmas.&#8221;<br />
But when Luvah assumed the World of Urizen in the South<br />
All fell towards the Center sinking downward in dire Ruin<br />
Here in these Chaoses the Sons of Ololon took their abode<br />
In Chasms of the Mundane Shell which open on all sides round<br />
Southward &amp; by the East within the Breach of Miltons descent<br />
&#8220;To watch the time, pitying &amp; gentle to awaken Urizen&#8221;<br />
They stood in a dark land of death of fiery corroding waters<br />
Where lie in evil death the Four Immortals pale and cold<br />
And the Eternal Man even Albion upon the Rock of Ages[.]<br />
&#8220;Seeing Miltons Shadow, some Daughters of Beulah trembling&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Returnd, but Ololon remaind before the Gates of the Dead&#8221;</p>
<p>And Ololon looked down into the Heavens of Ulro in fear<br />
They said. How are the Wars of Man which in Great Eternity</p>
<p>&#8220;Appear around, in the External Spheres of Visionary Life&#8221;<br />
Here renderd Deadly within the Life &amp; Interior Vision<br />
&#8220;How are the Beasts &amp; Birds &amp; Fishes, &amp; Plants &amp; Minerals&#8221;<br />
Here fixd into a frozen bulk subject to decay &amp; death[?]<br />
Those Visions of Human Life &amp; Shadows of Wisdom &amp; Knowledge</p>
<p>Are here frozen to unexpansive deadly destroying terrors[.]<br />
And War &amp; Hunting: the Two Fountains of the River of Life<br />
Are become Fountains of bitter Death &amp; of corroding Hell<br />
Till Brotherhood is changd into a Curse &amp; a Flattery<br />
&#8220;By Differences between Ideas, that Ideas themselves, (which are&#8221;<br />
The Divine Members) may be slain in offerings for sin<br />
O dreadful Loom of Death! O piteous Female forms compelld<br />
&#8220;To weave the Woof of Death, On Camberwell Tirzahs Courts&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Malahs on Blackheath, Rahab &amp; Noah. dwell on Windsors heights&#8221;<br />
Where once the Cherubs of Jerusalem spread to Lambeths Vale<br />
Milcahs Pillars shine from Harrow to Hampstead where Hoglah<br />
On Highgates heights magnificent Weaves overtrembling Thames<br />
To Shooters Hill and thence to Blackheath the dark Woof! Loud<br />
Loud roll the Weights &amp; Spindles over the whole Earth let down<br />
&#8220;On all sides round to the Four Quarters of the World, eastward on&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Europe to Euphrates &amp; Hindu, to Nile &amp; back in Clouds&#8221;<br />
Of Death across the Atlantic to America North &amp; South</p>
<p>&#8220;So spake Ololon in reminiscence astonishd, but they&#8221;<br />
Could not behold Golgonooza without passing the Polypus<br />
&#8220;A wondrous journey not passable by Immortal feet, &amp; none&#8221;<br />
But the Divine Saviour can pass it without annihilation.<br />
For Golgonooza cannot be seen till having passd the Polypus<br />
It is viewed on all sides round by a Four-fold Vision<br />
Or till you become Mortal &amp; Vegetable in Sexuality<br />
Then you behold its mighty Spires &amp; Domes of ivory &amp; gold<br />
And Ololon examined all the Couches of the Dead.<br />
Even of Los &amp; Enitharmon &amp; all the Sons of Albion<br />
And his Four Zoas terrified &amp; on the verge of Death<br />
&#8220;In midst of these was Miltons Couch, &amp; when they saw Eight&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Immortal Starry-Ones, guarding the Couch in flaming fires&#8221;<br />
They thunderous utterd all a universal groan falling down<br />
Prostrate before the Starry Eight asking with tears forgiveness<br />
Confessing their crime with humiliation and sorrow.</p>
<p>O how the Starry Eight rejoic&#8217;d to see Ololon descended!<br />
&#8220;And now that a wide road was open to Eternity,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By Ololons descent thro Beulah to Los &amp; Enitharmon,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For mighty were the multitudes of Ololon, vast the extent&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Of their great sway, reaching from Ulro to Eternity&#8221;</p>
<p>Surrounding the Mundane Shell outside in its Caverns<br />
And through Beulah. and all silent forbore to contend<br />
With Ololon for they saw the Lord in the Clouds of Ololon</p>
<p>There is a Moment in each Day that Satan cannot find<br />
&#8220;Nor can his Watch Fiends find it, but the Industrious find&#8221;<br />
This Moment &amp; it multiply. &amp; when it once is found<br />
It renovates every Moment of the Day if rightly placed[.]<br />
In this Moment Ololon descended to Los &amp; Enitharmon<br />
Unseen beyond the Mundane Shell Southward in Miltons track</p>
<p>Just in this Moment when the morning odours rise abroad<br />
&#8220;And first from the Wild Thyme, stands a Fountain in a rock&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Of crystal flowing into two Streams, one flows thro Golgonooza&#8221;<br />
And thro Beulah to Eden beneath Los&#8217;s western Wall<br />
The other flows thro the Aerial Void &amp; all the Churches<br />
Meeting again in Golgonooza beyond Satans Seat</p>
<p>&#8220;The Wild Thyme is Los&#8217;s Messenger to Eden, a mighty Demon&#8221;<br />
Terrible deadly &amp; poisonous his presence in Ulro dark<br />
Therefore he appears only a small Root creeping in grass<br />
Covering over the Rock of Odours his bright purple mantle<br />
Beside the Fount above the Larks nest in Golgonooza<br />
Luvah slept here in death &amp; here is Luvahs empty Tomb<br />
Ololon sat beside this Fountain on the Rock of Odours.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just at the place to where the Lark mounts, is a Crystal Gate&#8221;<br />
It is the enterance of the First Heaven named Luther: for<br />
The Lark is Los&#8217;s Messenger thro the Twenty-seven Churches<br />
That the Seven Eyes of God who walk even to Satans Seat<br />
Thro all the Twenty-seven Heavens may not slumber nor sleep</p>
<p>&#8220;But the Larks Nest is at the Gate of Los, at the eastern&#8221;<br />
Gate of wide Golgonooza &amp; the Lark is Los&#8217;s Messenger</p>
<p>When on the highest lift of his light pinions he arrives<br />
&#8220;At that bright Gate, another Lark meets him &amp; back to back&#8221;<br />
They touch their pinions tip tip: and each descend<br />
To their respective Earths &amp; there all night consult with Angels<br />
Of Providence &amp; with the Eyes of God all night in slumbers<br />
Inspired: &amp; at the dawn of day send out another Lark<br />
Into another Heaven to carry news upon his wings<br />
Thus are the Messengers dispatchd till they reach the Earth again<br />
&#8220;In the East Gate of Golgonooza, &amp; the Twenty-eighth bright&#8221;<br />
Lark. met the Female Ololon descending into my Garden<br />
Thus it appears to Mortal eyes &amp; those of the Ulro Heavens<br />
&#8220;But not thus to Immortals, the Lark is a mighty Angel.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Ololon step&#8217;d into the Polypus within the Mundane Shell<br />
They could not step into Vegetable Worlds without becoming</p>
<p>The enemies of Humanity except in a Female Form<br />
&#8220;And as One Female, Ololon and all its mighty Hosts&#8221;<br />
Appear&#8217;d: a Virgin of twelve years nor time nor space was<br />
To the perception of the Virgin Ololon but as the<br />
Flash of lightning but more quick the Virgin in my Garden<br />
Before my Cottage stood for the Satanic Space is delusion</p>
<p>For when Los joind with me he took me in his firy whirlwind<br />
My Vegetated portion was hurried from Lambeths shades<br />
He set me down in Felphams Vale &amp; prepard a beautiful<br />
Cottage for me that in three years I might write all these Visions<br />
To display Natures cruel holiness: the deceits of Natural Religion[.]<br />
&#8220;Walking in my Cottage Garden, sudden I beheld&#8221;<br />
The Virgin Ololon &amp; address&#8217;d her as a Daughter of Beulah[:]</p>
<p>Virgin of Providence fear not to enter into my Cottage<br />
What is thy message to thy friend: What am I now to do<br />
Is it again to plunge into deeper affliction? behold me<br />
&#8220;Ready to obey, but pity thou my Shadow of Delight&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Enter my Cottage, comfort her, for she is sick with fatigue t247&#8243;</p>
<p>The Virgin answerd. Knowest thou of Milton who descended<br />
Driven from Eternity; him I seek! terrified at my Act<br />
In Great Eternity which thou knowest! I come him to seek</p>
<p>So Ololon utterd in words distinct the anxious thought<br />
&#8220;Mild was the voice, but more distinct than any earthly&#8221;<br />
That Miltons Shadow heard &amp; condensing all his Fibres<br />
Into a strength impregnable of majesty &amp; beauty infinite<br />
I saw he was the Covering Cherub &amp; within him Satan<br />
&#8220;And Raha[b], in an outside which is fallacious! within t248&#8243;<br />
&#8220;Beyond the outline of Identity, in the Selfhood deadly&#8221;<br />
And he appeard the Wicker Man of Scandinavia in whom<br />
Jerusalems children consume in flames among the Stars</p>
