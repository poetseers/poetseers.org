				<p>&#8220;Descending down into my Garden, a Human Wonder of God&#8221;<br />
Reaching from heaven to earth a Cloud &amp; Human Form<br />
I beheld Milton with astonishment &amp; in him beheld<br />
&#8220;The Monstrous Churches of Beulah, the Gods of Ulro dark&#8221;<br />
Twelve monstrous dishumanizd terrors Synagogues of Satan.<br />
A Double Twelve &amp; Thrice Nine: such their divisions.</p>
<p>And these their Names &amp; their Places within the Mundane Shell</p>
<p>In Tyre &amp; Sidon I saw Baal &amp; Ashtaroth. In Moab Chemosh<br />
&#8220;In Ammon, Molech: loud his Furnaces rage among the Wheels&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Of Og, &amp; pealing loud the cries of the Victims of Fire!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;And pale his Priestesses infolded in Veils of Pestilence, border&#8217;d&#8221;<br />
With War; Woven in Looms of Tyre &amp; Sidon by beautiful Ashtaroth.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Palestine Dagon, Sea Monster! worshipd o&#8217;er the Sea.&#8221;<br />
Thammuz in Lebanon &amp; Rimmon in Damascus curtaind<br />
Osiris: Isis: Orus: in Egypt: dark their Tabernacles on Nile<br />
&#8220;Floating with solemn songs, &amp; on the Lakes of Egypt nightly&#8221;<br />
&#8220;With pomp, even till morning break &amp; Osiris appear in the sky&#8221;<br />
&#8220;But Belial of Sodom &amp; Gomorrha, obscure Demon of Bribes&#8221;<br />
&#8220;And secret Assasinations, not worshipd nor adord; but t249&#8243;<br />
With the finger on the lips &amp; the back turnd to the light<br />
And Saturn Jove &amp; Rhea of the Isles of the Sea remote<br />
These Twelve Gods. are the Twelve Spectre Sons of the Druid Albion</p>
<p>And these the names of the Twenty-seven Heavens &amp; their Churches<br />
&#8220;Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Methuselah, Lamech: these are Giants mighty Hermaphroditic&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Noah, Shem, Arphaxad, Cainan the second, Salah, Heber,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Peeg, Reu, Serug, Nahor, Terah, these are the Female-Males&#8221;<br />
&#8220;A Male within a Female hid as in an Ark &amp; Curtains,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Abraham, Moses, Solomon, Paul, Constantine, Charlemaine&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Luther, these seven are the Male-Females, the Dragon Forms&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Religion hid in War, a Dragon red &amp; hidden Harlot&#8221;</p>
<p>All these are seen in Miltons Shadow who is the Covering Cherub<br />
The Spectre of Albion in which the Spectre of Luvah inhabits<br />
In the Newtonian Voids between the Substances of Creation</p>
<p>For the Chaotic Voids outside of the Stars are measured by<br />
&#8220;The Stars, which are the boundaries of Kingdoms, Provinces&#8221;<br />
And Empires of Chaos invisible to the Vegetable Man<br />
The Kingdom of Og. is in Orion: Sihon is in Ophiucus<br />
Og has Twenty-seven Districts; Sihons Districts Twenty-one<br />
&#8220;From Star to Star, Mountains &amp; Valleys, terrible dimension&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Stretchd out, compose the Mundane Shell, a mighty Incrustation&#8221;<br />
Of Forty-eight deformed Human Wonders of the Almighty<br />
With Caverns whose remotest bottoms meet again beyond<br />
&#8220;The Mundane Shell in Golgonooza, but the Fires of Los, rage&#8221;<br />
&#8220;In the remotest bottoms of the Caves, that none can pass&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Into Eternity that way, but all descend to Los&#8221;<br />
To Bowlahoola &amp; Allamanda &amp; to Entuthon Benython</p>
<p>&#8220;The Heavens are the Cherub, the Twelve Gods are Satan&#8221;</p>
<p>And the Forty-eight Starry Regions are Cities of the Levites<br />
&#8220;The Heads of the Great Polypus, Four-fold twelve enormity&#8221;<br />
In mighty &amp; mysterious comingling enemy with enemy<br />
Woven by Urizen into Sexes from his mantle of years[.]<br />
And Milton collecting all his fibres into impregnable strength<br />
Descended down a Paved work of all kinds of precious stones<br />
Out from the eastern sky; descending down into my Cottage<br />
&#8220;Garden: clothed in black, severe &amp; silent he descended.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Spectre of Satan stood upon the roaring sea &amp; beheld<br />
Milton within hi sleeping Humanity! trembling &amp; shuddring<br />
He stood upon the waves a Twenty-seven-fold mighty Demon<br />
Gorgeous &amp; beautiful: loud roll his thunders against Milton<br />
&#8220;Loud Satan thunderd, loud &amp; dark upon mild Felpham shore&#8221;<br />
Not daring to touch one fibre he howld round upon the Sea.</p>
<p>I also stood in Satans bosom &amp; beheld its desolations!<br />
A ruind Man: a ruind building of God not made with hands;<br />
&#8220;Its plains of burning sand, its mountains of marble terrible:&#8221;<br />
Its pits &amp; declivities flowing with molten ore &amp; fountains<br />
Of pitch &amp; nitre: its ruind palaces &amp; cities &amp; mighty works;<br />
Its furnaces of affliction in which his Angels &amp; Emanations<br />
Labour with blackend visages among its stupendous ruins<br />
Arches &amp; pyramids &amp; porches colonades &amp; domes:<br />
&#8220;In which dwells Mystery Babylon, here is her secret place&#8221;<br />
From hence she comes forth on the Churches in delight<br />
&#8220;Here is her Cup filld with its poisons, in these horrid vales&#8221;<br />
And here her scarlet Veil woven in pestilence &amp; war:<br />
&#8220;Here is Jerusalem bound in chains, in the Dens of Babylon&#8221;</p>
<p>In the Eastern porch of Satans Universe Milton stood &amp; said</p>
<p>Satan! my Spectre! I know my power thee to annihilate<br />
&#8220;And be a greater in thy place, &amp; be thy Tabernacle&#8221;<br />
&#8220;A covering for thee to do thy will, till one greater comes&#8221;<br />
And smites me as I smote thee &amp; becomes my covering.<br />
Such are the Laws of thy false Heavns! but Laws of Eternity<br />
Are not such: know thou: I come to Self Annihilation<br />
Such are the Laws of Eternity that each shall mutually<br />
&#8220;Annihilate himself for others good, as I for thee[.]&#8220;<br />
Thy purpose &amp; the purpose of thy Priests &amp; of thy Churches<br />
Is to impress on men the fear of death; to teach<br />
&#8220;Trembling &amp; fear, terror, constriction; abject selfishness&#8221;<br />
Mine is to teach Men to despise death &amp; to go on<br />
&#8220;In fearless majesty annihilating Self, laughing to scorn&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Thy Laws &amp; terrors, shaking down thy Synagogues as webs&#8221;<br />
I come to discover before Heavn &amp; Hell the Self righteousness<br />
&#8220;In all its Hypocritic turpitude, opening to every eye&#8221;<br />
These wonders of Satans holiness shewing to the Earth<br />
&#8220;The Idol Virtues of the Natural Heart, &amp; Satans Seat&#8221;<br />
Explore in all its Selfish Natural Virtue &amp; put off<br />
In Self annihilation all that is not of God alone:<br />
To put off Self &amp; all I have ever &amp; ever Amen</p>
<p>&#8220;Satan heard! Coming in a cloud, with trumpets &amp; flaming fire&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Saying I am God the judge of all, the living &amp; the dead&#8221;<br />
Fall therefore down &amp; worship me. submit thy supreme<br />
&#8220;Dictate, to my eternal Will &amp; to my dictate bow&#8221;</p>
<p>I hold the Balances of Right &amp; Just &amp; mine the Sword<br />
Seven Angels bear my Name &amp; in those Seven I appear<br />
But I alone am God &amp; I alone in Heavn &amp; Earth<br />
&#8220;Of all that live dare utter this, others tremble &amp; bow&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Till All Things become One Great Satan, in Holiness&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Oppos&#8217;d to Mercy, and the Divine Delusion Jesus be no more&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suddenly around Milton on my Path, the Starry Seven&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Burnd terrible! my Path became a solid fire, as bright&#8221;<br />
As the clear Sun &amp; Milton silent came down on my Path.<br />
And there went forth from the Starry limbs of the Seven: Forms<br />
&#8220;Human; with Trumpets innumerable, sounding articulate&#8221;<br />
As the Seven spake; and they stood in a mighty Column of Fire<br />
&#8220;Surrounding Felphams Vale, reaching to the Mundane Shell, Saying&#8221;<br />
Awake Albion awake! reclaim thy Reasoning Spectre. Subdue</p>
<p>&#8220;Him to the Divine Mercy, Cast him down into the Lake&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Of Los, that ever burneth with fire, ever &amp; ever Amen!&#8221;<br />
Let the Four Zoa&#8217;s awake from Slumbers of Six Thousand Years</p>
<p>Then loud the Furnaces of Los were heard! &amp; seen as Seven heavens<br />
Stretching from south to north over the mountains of Albion</p>
<p>&#8220;Satan heard; trembling round his Body, he incircled it&#8221;<br />
He trembled with exceeding great trembling &amp; astonishment<br />
Howling in his Spectre round his Body hungring to devour<br />
&#8220;But fearing for the pain for if he touches a Vital,&#8221;<br />
His torment is unendurable: therefore he cannot devour:<br />
But howls round it as a lion round his prey continually<br />
&#8220;Loud Satan thunderd, loud &amp; dark upon mild Felphams Shore&#8221;<br />
Coming in a Cloud with Trumpets &amp; with Fiery Flame<br />
An awful Form eastward from midst of a bright Paved-work<br />
Of precious stones by Cherubim surrounded: so permitted<br />
(Lest he should fall apart in his Eternal Death) to imitate<br />
The Eternal Great Humanity Divine surrounded by<br />
His Cherubim &amp; Seraphim in ever happy Eternity<br />
Beneath sat Chaos: Sin on his right hand Death on his left<br />
And Ancient Night spread over all the heavn his Mantle of Laws<br />
He trembled with exceeding great trembling &amp; astonishment</p>
<p>Then Albion rose up in the Night of Beulah on his Couch<br />
Of dread repose seen by the visionary eye; his face is toward<br />
&#8220;The east, toward Jerusalems Gates: groaning he sat above&#8221;<br />
His rocks. London &amp; Bath &amp; Legions &amp; Edinburgh<br />
Are the four pillars of his Throne; his left foot near London<br />
Covers the shades of Tyburn: his instep from Windsor<br />
To Primrose Hill stretching to Highgate &amp; Holloway</p>
<p>London is between his knees: its basements fourfold<br />
&#8220;His right foot stretches to the sea on Dover cliffs, his heel&#8221;<br />
On Canterburys ruins; his right hand covers lofty Wales<br />
His left Scotland; his bosom girt with gold involves<br />
&#8220;York, Edinburgh, Durham &amp; Carlisle &amp; on the front&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Bath, Oxford, Cambridge Norwich; his right elbow&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Leans on the Rocks of Erins Land, Ireland ancient nation[,]&#8220;<br />
His head bends over London: he sees his embodied Spectre<br />
Trembling before him with exceeding great trembling &amp; fear<br />
&#8220;He views Jerusalem &amp; Babylon, his tears flow down&#8221;<br />
&#8220;He movd his right foot to Cornwall, his left to the Rocks of Bognor&#8221;<br />
He strove to rise to walk into the Deep. but strength failing<br />
Forbad &amp; down with dreadful groans he sunk upon his Couch<br />
In moony Beulah. Los his strong Guard walks round beneath the Moon</p>
<p>Urizen faints in terror striving among the Brooks of Arnon<br />
With Miltons Spirit: as the Plowman or Artificer or Shepherd<br />
While in the labours of his Calling sends his Thought abroad t250<br />
To labour in the ocean or in the starry heaven. So Milton<br />
&#8220;Labourd in Chasms of the Mundane Shell, tho here before&#8221;<br />
&#8220;My Cottage midst the Starry Seven, where the Virgin Ololon&#8221;<br />
Stood trembling in the Porch: loud Satan thunderd on the stormy Sea<br />
Circling Albions Cliffs in which the Four-fold World resides<br />
Tho seen in fallacy outside: a fallacy of Satans Churches</p>
<p>Before Ololon Milton stood &amp; percievd the Eternal Form<br />
Of that mild Vision; wondrous were their acts by me unknown<br />
Except remotely; and I heard Ololon say to Milton</p>
<p>I see thee strive upon the Brooks of Arnon. there a dread<br />
&#8220;And awful Man I see, oercoverd with the mantle of years.&#8221;<br />
I behold Los &amp; Urizen. I behold Orc &amp; Tharmas;<br />
The Four Zoa&#8217;s of Albion &amp; thy Spirit with them striving<br />
In Self annihilation giving thy life to thy enemies<br />
Are those who contemn Religion &amp; seek to annihilate it<br />
Become in their Femin[in]e portions the causes &amp; promoters<br />
&#8220;Of these Religions, how is this thing? this Newtonian Phantasm&#8221;<br />
This Voltaire &amp; Rousseau: this Hume &amp; Gibbon &amp; Bolingbroke<br />
This Natural Religion! this impossible absurdity<br />
Is Ololon the cause of this? O where shall I hide my face<br />
These tears fall for the little-ones: the Children of Jerusalem<br />
Lest they be annihilated in thy annihilation.</p>
<p>No sooner she had spoke but Rahab Babylon appeard<br />
Eastward upon the Paved work across Europe &amp; Asia<br />
Glorious as the midday Sun in Satans bosom glowing:<br />
&#8220;A Female hidden in a Male, Religion hidden in War&#8221;</p>
<p>
Namd Moral Virtue; cruel two-fold Monster shining bright<br />
A Dragon red &amp; hidden Harlot which John in Patmos saw</p>
<p>And all beneath the Nations innumerable of Ulro<br />
&#8220;Appeard, the Seven Kingdoms of Canaan &amp; Five Baalim&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Of Philistea. into Twelve divided, calld after the Names&#8221;<br />
Of Israel: as they are in Eden. Mountain. River &amp; Plain<br />
City &amp; sandy Desart intermingled beyond mortal ken<br />
But turning toward Ololon in terrible majesty Milton<br />
Replied. Obey thou the Words of the Inspired Man<br />
All that can be annihilated must be annihilated t251</p>
<p>That the Children of Jerusalem may be saved from slavery<br />
&#8220;There is a Negation, &amp; there is a Contrary&#8221;<br />
The Negation must be destroyd to redeem the Contraries<br />
The Negation is the Spectre; the Reasoning Power in Man<br />
This is a false Body: an Incrustation over my Immortal<br />
&#8220;Spirit; a Selfhood, which must be put off &amp; annihilated alway&#8221;<br />
To cleanse the Face of my Spirit by Self-examination.</p>
<p>To bathe in the Waters of Life; to wash off the Not Human<br />
I come in Self-annihilation &amp; the grandeur of Inspiration<br />
To cast off Rational Demonstration by Faith in the Saviour<br />
To cast off the rotten rags of Memory by Inspiration<br />
&#8220;To cast off Bacon, Locke &amp; Newton from Albions covering&#8221;<br />
&#8220;To take off his filthy garments, &amp; clothe him with Imagination&#8221;<br />
&#8220;To cast aside from Poetry, all that is not Inspiration&#8221;<br />
That it no longer shall dare to mock with the aspersion of Madness<br />
&#8220;Cast on the Inspired, by the tame high finisher of paltry Blots,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Indefinite, or paltry Rhymes; or paltry Harmonies.&#8221;<br />
Who creeps into State Government like a catterpiller to destroy<br />
&#8220;To cast off the idiot Questioner who is always questioning,&#8221;<br />
But never capable of answering; who sits with a sly grin<br />
&#8220;Silent plotting when to question, like a thief in a cave;&#8221;<br />
Who publishes doubt &amp; calls it knowledge; whose Science is Despair<br />
&#8220;Whose pretence to knowledge is Envy, whose whole Science is&#8221;<br />
To destroy the wisdom of ages to gratify ravenous Envy;<br />
That rages round him like a Wolf day &amp; night without rest<br />
He smiles with condescension; he talks of Benevolence &amp; Virtue<br />
&#8220;And those who act with Benevolence &amp; Virtue, they murder time on time&#8221;<br />
&#8220;These are the destroyers of Jerusalem, these are the murderers&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Of Jesus, who deny the Faith &amp; mock at Eternal Life:&#8221;<br />
Who pretend to Poetry that they may destroy Imagination;<br />
By imitation of Natures Images drawn from Remembrance<br />
&#8220;These are the Sexual Garments, the Abomination of Desolation&#8221;<br />
Hiding the Human lineaments as with an Ark &amp; Curtains</p>
<p>Which Jesus rent: &amp; now shall wholly purge away with Fire<br />
Till Generation is swallowd up in Regeneration.</p>
<p>Then trembled the Virgin Ololon &amp; replyd in clouds of despair</p>
<p>Is this our Femin[in]e Portion the Six-fold Miltonic Female<br />
Terribly this Portion trembles before thee O awful Man<br />
Altho&#8217; our Human Power can sustain the severe contentions<br />
&#8220;Of Friendship, our Sexual cannot: but flies into the Ulro.&#8221;<br />
Hence arose all our terrors in Eternity! &amp; now remembrance<br />
&#8220;Returns upon us! are we Contraries O Milton, Thou &amp; I&#8221;<br />
O Immortal! how were we led to War the Wars of Death<br />
&#8220;Is this the Void Outside of Existence, which if enterd into&#8221;</p>
<p>Becomes a Womb? &amp; is this the Death Couch of Albion<br />
Thou goest to Eternal Death &amp; all must go with thee</p>
<p>&#8220;So saying, the Virgin divided Six-fold &amp; with a shriek&#8221;<br />
Dolorous that ran thro all Creation a Double Six-fold Wonder!<br />
Away from Ololon she divided &amp; fled into the depths<br />
Of Miltons Shadow as a Dove upon the stormy Sea.</p>
<p>Then as a Moony Ark Ololon descended to Felphams Vale<br />
&#8220;In clouds of blood, in streams of gore, with dreadful thunderings&#8221;<br />
Into the Fires of Intellect that rejoic&#8217;d in Felphams Vale<br />
Around the Starry Eight: with one accord the Starry Eight became<br />
One Man Jesus the Saviour. wonderful! round his limbs<br />
The Clouds of Ololon folded as a Garment dipped in blood<br />
Written within &amp; without in woven letters: &amp; the Writing<br />
Is the Divine Revelation in the Litteral expression:<br />
&#8220;A Garment of War, I heard it namd the Woof of Six Thousand Years&#8221;</p>
<p>And I beheld the Twenty-four Cities of Albion<br />
Arise upon their Thrones to Judge the Nations of the Earth<br />
And the Immortal Four in whom the Twenty-four appear Four-fold<br />
Arose around Albions body: Jesus wept &amp; walked forth<br />
&#8220;From Felphams Vale clothed in Clouds of blood, to enter into&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Albions Bosom, the bosom of death &amp; the Four surrounded him&#8221;<br />
In the Column of Fire in Felphams Vale; then to their mouths the Four<br />
Applied their Four Trumpets &amp; them sounded to the Four winds</p>
<p>Terror struck in the Vale I stood at that immortal sound<br />
My bones trembled. I fell outstretchd upon the path<br />
&#8220;A moment, &amp; my Soul returnd into its mortal state&#8221;<br />
To Resurrection &amp; Judgment in the Vegetable Body<br />
And my sweet Shadow of Delight stood trembling by my side</p>
<p>Immediately the Lark mounted with a loud trill from Felphams Vale<br />
And the Wild Thyme from Wimbletons green &amp; impurpled Hills</p>
<p>And Los &amp; Enitharmon rose over the Hills of Surrey<br />
&#8220;Their clouds roll over London with a south wind, soft Oothoon&#8221;<br />
Pants in the Vales of Lambeth weeping oer her Human Harvest<br />
Los listens to the Cry of the Poor Man: his Cloud<br />
&#8220;Over London in volume terrific, low bended in anger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rintrah &amp; Palamabron view the Human Harvest beneath<br />
Their Wine-presses &amp; Barns stand open; the Ovens are prepar&#8217;d<br />
The Waggons ready: terrific Lions &amp; Tygers sport &amp; play<br />
&#8220;All Animals upon the Earth, are prepard in all their strength&#8221;</p>
<p>To go forth to the Great Harvest &amp; Vintage of the Nations.</p>
<p>
The End</p>
