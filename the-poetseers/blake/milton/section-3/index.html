				<p>&#8220;The Mundane Shell, is a vast Concave Earth: an immense&#8221;<br />
Hardend shadow of all things upon our Vegetated Earth<br />
&#8220;Enlarg&#8217;d into dimension &amp; deform&#8217;d into indefinite space,&#8221;<br />
In Twenty-seven Heavens and all their Hells; with Chaos<br />
And Ancient Night; &amp; Purgatory. It is a cavernous Earth</p>
<p>&#8220;Of labyrinthine intricacy, twenty-seven folds of opakeness&#8221;<br />
And finishes where the lark mounts; here Milton journeyed<br />
In that Region calld Midian among the Rocks of Horeb<br />
&#8220;For travellers from Eternity. pass outward to Satans seat,&#8221;<br />
But travellers to Eternity. pass inward to Golgonooza.</p>
<p>&#8220;Los the Vehicular terror beheld him, &amp; divine Enitharmon&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Call&#8217;d all her daughters, Saying. Surely to unloose my bond&#8221;<br />
Is this Man come! Satan shall be unloosd upon Albion<br />
Los heard in terror Enitharmons words: in fibrous strength<br />
His limbs shot forth like roots of trees against the forward path<br />
&#8220;Of Miltons jouney. Urizen beheld the immortal Man,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Tharmas Demon of the Waters, &amp; Orc, who is Luvah&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Shadowy Female seeing Milton, howl&#8217;d in her lamentation&#8221;<br />
Over the Deeps. outstretching her Twenty seven Heavens over Albion</p>
<p>And thus the Shadowy Female howls in articulate howlings</p>
<p>I will lament over Milton in the lamentations of the afflicted<br />
My Garments shall be woven of sighs &amp; heart broken lamentations<br />
The misery of unhappy Families shall be drawn out into its border<br />
Wrought with the needle with dire sufferings poverty pain &amp; woe<br />
Along the rocky Island &amp; thence throughout the whole Earth<br />
There shall be the sick Father &amp; his starving Family! there<br />
The Prisoner in the stone Dungeon &amp; the Slave at the Mill<br />
I will have Writings written all over it in Human Words<br />
That every Infant that is born upon the Earth shall read<br />
And get by rote as a hard task of a life of sixty years<br />
&#8220;I will have Kings inwoven upon it, &amp; Councellors &amp; Mighty Men&#8221;<br />
The Famine shall clasp it together with buckles &amp; Clasps<br />
And the Pestilence shall be its fringe &amp; the War its girdle<br />
To divide into Rahab &amp; Tirzah that Milton may come to our tents<br />
For I will put on the Human Form &amp; take the Image of God<br />
Even Pity &amp; Humanity but my Clothing shall be Cruelty<br />
And I will put on Holiness as a breastplate &amp; as a helmet<br />
And all my ornaments shall be of the gold of broken hearts<br />
And the precious stones of anxiety &amp; care &amp; desperation &amp; death<br />
And repentance for sin &amp; sorrow &amp; punishment &amp; fear<br />
To defend me from thy terrors O Orc! my only beloved!</p>
<p>Orc answerd. Take not the Human Form O loveliest. Take not<br />
Terror upon thee! Behold how I am &amp; tremble lest thou also<br />
Consume in my Consummation; but thou maist take a Form<br />
&#8220;Female &amp; lovely, that cannot consume in Mans consmmation&#8221;<br />
Wherefore dost thou Create &amp; Weave this Satan for a Covering[?]<br />
&#8220;When thou attemptest to put on the Human Form, my wrath&#8221;</p>
<p>Burns to the top of heaven against thee in Jealousy &amp; Fear.<br />
&#8220;Then I rend thee asunder, then I howl over thy clay &amp; ashes&#8221;<br />
When wilt thou put on the Female Form as in times of old<br />
With a Garment of Pity &amp; Compassion like the Garment of God<br />
His garments are long sufferings for the Children of Men<br />
Jerusalem is his Garment &amp; not thy Covering Cherub O lovely<br />
Shadow of my delight who wanderest seeking for the prey.</p>
<p>So spoke Orc when Oothoon &amp; Leutha hoverd over his Couch<br />
Of fire in interchange of Beauty &amp; Perfection in the darkness<br />
Opening interiorly into Jerusalem &amp; Babylon shining glorious<br />
In the Shadowy Females bosom. Jealous her darkness grew:<br />
Howlings filld all the desolate places in accusations of Sin<br />
In Female beauty shining in the unformd void &amp; Orc in vain<br />
&#8220;Stretch&#8217;d out his hands of fire, &amp; wooed: they triumph in his pain&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus darkend the Shadowy Female tenfold &amp; Orc tenfold<br />
Glowd on his rocky Couch against the darkness: loud thunders<br />
Told of the enormous conflict[.] Earthquake beneath: around;<br />
&#8220;Rent the Immortal Females, limb from limb &amp; joint from joint&#8221;<br />
And moved the fast foundations of the Earth to wake the Dead</p>
<p>&#8220;Urizen emerged from his Rocky Form &amp; from his Snows,&#8221;</p>
<p>And he also darkend his brows: freezing dark rocks between<br />
The footsteps. and infixing deep the feet in marble beds:<br />
&#8220;That Milton labourd with his journey, &amp; his feet bled sore&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Upon the clay now chang&#8217;d to marble; also Urizen rose,&#8221;<br />
And met him on the shores of Arnon; &amp; by the streams of the brooks</p>
<p>&#8220;Silent they met, and silent strove among the streams, of Arnon&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Even to Mahanaim, when with cold hand Urizen stoop&#8217;d down&#8221;<br />
And took up water from the river Jordan: pouring on<br />
To Miltons brain the icy fluid from his broad cold palm.<br />
&#8220;But Milton took of the red clay of Succoth, moulding it with care&#8221;<br />
Between his palms: and filling up the furrows of many years<br />
&#8220;Beginning at the feet of Urizen, and on the bones&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Creating new flesh on the Demon cold, and building him,&#8221;<br />
As with new clay a Human form in the Valley of Beth Peor.</p>
<p>Four Universes round the Mundane Egg remain Chaotic<br />
&#8220;One to the North, named Urthona: One to the South, named Urizen:&#8221;<br />
&#8220;One to the East, named Luvah: One to the West, named Tharmas&#8221;<br />
They are the Four Zoa&#8217;s that stood around the Throne Divine!<br />
But when Luvah assum&#8217;d the World of Urizen to the South:<br />
&#8220;And Albion was slain upon his mountains, &amp; in his tent;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;All fell towards the Center in dire ruin, sinking down.&#8221;<br />
And in the South remains a burning fire; in the East a void.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the West, a world of raging waters; in the North a solid,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Unfathomable! without end. But in the midst of these,&#8221;<br />
Is built eternally the Universe of Los and Enitharmon:<br />
&#8220;Towards which Milton went, but Urizen oppos&#8217;d his path.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Man and Demon strove many periods. Rahab beheld<br />
Standing on Carmel; Rahab and Tirzah trembled to behold<br />
&#8220;The enormous strife. one giving life, the other giving death&#8221;<br />
To his adversary. and they sent forth all their sons &amp; daughters<br />
&#8220;In all their beauty to entice Milton across the river,&#8221;</p>
<p>The Twofold form Hermaphroditic: and the Double-sexed;<br />
&#8220;The Female-male &amp; the Male-female, self-dividing stood&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Before him in their beauty, &amp; in cruelties of holiness!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Shining in darkness, glorious upon the deeps of Entuthon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saying. Come thou to Ephraim! behold the Kings of Canaan!<br />
&#8220;The beautiful Amalekites, behold the fires of youth&#8221;<br />
Bound with the Chain of jealousy by Los &amp; Enitharmon;<br />
The banks of Cam: cold learnings streams: Londons dark-frowning towers;<br />
Lament upon the winds of Europe in Rephaims Vale.<br />
&#8220;Because Ahania rent apart into a desolate night,&#8221;<br />
Laments! &amp; Enion wanders like a weeping inarticulate voice<br />
And Vala labours for her bread &amp; water among the Furnaces<br />
Therefore bright Tirzah triumphs: putting on all beauty.<br />
&#8220;And all perfection, in her cruel sports among the Victims,&#8221;<br />
Come bring with thee Jerusalem with songs on the Grecian Lyre!<br />
&#8220;In Natural Religion! in experiments on Men,&#8221;<br />
Let her be Offerd up to Holiness! Tirzah numbers her;<br />
She numbers with her fingers every fibre ere it grow;<br />
Where is the Lamb of God? where is the promise of his coming?<br />
&#8220;Her shadowy Sisters form the bones, even the bones of Horeb:&#8221;<br />
Around the marrow! and the orbed scull around the brain!<br />
His Images are born for War! for Sacrifice to Tirzah!<br />
To Natural Religion! to Tirzah the Daughter of Rahab the Holy!<br />
&#8220;She ties the knot of nervous fibres, into a white brain!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;She ties the knot of bloody veins, into a red hot heart!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Within her bosom Albion lies embalmd, never to awake&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Hand is become a rock! Sinai &amp; Horeb, is Hyle &amp; Coban: t228&#8243;<br />
Scofield is bound in iron armour before Reubens Gate!<br />
&#8220;She ties the knot of milky seed into two lovely Heavens,&#8221;</p>
<p>Two yet but one: each in the other sweet reflected! these<br />
&#8220;Are our Three Heavens beneath the shades of Beulah, land of rest!&#8221;<br />
Come then to Ephraim &amp; Manasseh O beloved-one!<br />
Come to my ivory palaces O beloved of thy mother!</p>
<p>And let us bind thee in the bands of War &amp; be thou King<br />
Of Canaan and reign in Hazor where the Twelve Tribes meet.</p>
<p>So spoke they as in one voice! Silent Milton stood before<br />
The darkend Urizen; as the sculptor silent stands before<br />
His forming image; he walks round it patient labouring.<br />
&#8220;Thus Milton stood forming bright Urizen, while his Mortal part&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Sat frozen in the rock of Horeb: and his Redeemed portion,&#8221;<br />
Thus form&#8217;d the Clay of Urizen; but within that portion<br />
His real Human walkd above in power and majesty<br />
Tho darkend; and the Seven Angels of the Presence attended him.</p>
<p>&#8220;O how can I with my gross tongue that cleaveth to the dust,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Tell of the Four-fold Man, in starry numbers fitly orderd&#8221;<br />
Or how can I with my cold hand of clay! But thou O Lord<br />
&#8220;Do with me as thou wilt! for I am nothing, and vanity.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;If thou chuse to elect a worm, it shall remove the mountains.&#8221;<br />
For that portion namd the Elect: the Spectrous body of Milton:<br />
&#8220;Redounding from my left foot into Los&#8217;s Mundane space,&#8221;<br />
Brooded over his Body in Horeb against the Resurrection<br />
Preparing it for the Great Consummation; red the Cherub on Sinai<br />
Glow&#8217;d; but in terrors folded round his clouds of blood.</p>
<p>Now Albions sleeping Humanity began to turn upon his Couch;<br />
Feeling the electric flame of Miltons awful precipitate descent.<br />
&#8220;Seest thou the little winged fly, smaller than a grain of sand?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;It has a heart like thee; a brain open to heaven &amp; hell,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Withinside wondrous &amp; expansive; its gates are not clos&#8217;d,&#8221;<br />
I hope thine are not: hence it clothes itself in rich array;<br />
Hence thou art cloth&#8217;d with human beauty O thou mortal man.<br />
Seek not thy heavenly father then beyond the skies:<br />
There Chaos dwells &amp; ancient Night &amp; Og &amp; Anak old:<br />
&#8220;For every human heart has gates of brass &amp; bars of adamant,&#8221;<br />
Which few dare unbar because dread Og &amp; Anak guard the gates<br />
Terrific! and each mortal brain is walld and moated round<br />
Within: and Og &amp; Anak watch here; here is the Seat<br />
Of Satan in its Webs; for in brain and heart and loins<br />
Gates open behind Satans Seat to the City of Golgonooza<br />
&#8220;Which is the spiritual fourfold London, in the loins of Albion&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus Milton fell thro Albions heart, travlling outside of Humanity&#8221;<br />
Beyond the Stars in Chaos in Caverns of the Mundane Shell.</p>
<p>But many of the Eternals rose up from eternal tables<br />
&#8220;Drunk with the Spirit, burning round the Couch of death they stood&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Looking down into Beulah: wrathful, fill&#8217;d with rage!&#8221;<br />
They rend the heavens round the Watchers in a fiery circle:<br />
And round the Shadowy Eighth: the Eight close up the Couch</p>
<p>&#8220;Into a tabernacle, and flee with cries down to the Deeps:&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Where Los opens his three wide gates, surrounded by raging fires!&#8221;<br />
They soon find their own place &amp; join the Watchers of the Ulro.</p>
<p>Los saw them and a cold pale horror coverd o&#8217;er his limbs<br />
Pondering he knew that Rintrah &amp; Palamabron might depart:<br />
Even as Reuben &amp; as Gad; gave up himself to tears.<br />
He sat down on his anvil-stock; and leand upon the trough.<br />
&#8220;Looking into the black water, mingling it with tears.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last when desperation almost tore his heart in twain<br />
&#8220;He recollected an old Prophecy in Eden recorded,&#8221;<br />
And often sung to the loud harp at the immortal feasts<br />
That Milton of the Land of Albion should up ascend<br />
Forwards from Ulro from the Vale of Felpham; and set free<br />
&#8220;Orc from his Chain of Jealousy, he started at the thought&#8221;</p>
<p>And down descended into Udan-Adan; it was night:<br />
And Satan sat sleeping upon his Couch in Udan-Adan:<br />
&#8220;His Spectre slept, his Shadow woke; when one sleeps th&#8217;other wakes&#8221;</p>
<p>But Milton entering my Foot; I saw in the nether<br />
&#8220;Regions of the Imagination; also all men on Earth,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;And all in Heaven, saw in the nether regions of the Imagination&#8221;<br />
&#8220;In Ulro beneath Beulah, the vast breach of Miltons descent.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;But I knew not that it was Milton, for man cannot know&#8221;<br />
What passes in his members till periods of Space &amp; Time<br />
Reveal the secrets of Eternity: for more extensive<br />
&#8220;Than any other earthly things, are Mans earthly lineaments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And all this Vegetable World appeard on my left Foot,&#8221;<br />
As a bright sandal formd immortal of precious stones &amp; gold:<br />
I stooped down &amp; bound it on to walk forward thro&#8217; Eternity.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is in Eden a sweet River, of milk &amp; liquid pearl,&#8221;<br />
Namd Ololon; on whose mild banks dwelt those who Milton drove<br />
Down into Ulro: and they wept in long resounding song<br />
&#8220;For seven days of eternity, and the rivers living banks&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The mountains waild! &amp; every plant that grew, in solemn sighs lamented.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Luvahs bulls each morning drag the sulphur Sun out of the Deep<br />
Harnessd with starry harness black &amp; shining kept by black slaves<br />
That work all night at the starry harness. Strong and vigorous<br />
They drag the unwilling Orb: at this time all the Family<br />
&#8220;Of Eden heard the lamentation, and Providence began.&#8221;<br />
But when the clarions of day sounded they drownd the lamentations</p>
<p>And when night came all was silent in Ololon: &amp; all refusd to lament<br />
In the still night fearing lest they should others molest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven mornings Los heard them, as the poor bird within the shell&#8221;<br />
Hears its impatient parent bird; and Enitharmon heard them:<br />
&#8220;But saw them not, for the blue Mundane Shell inclosd them in.&#8221;</p>
<p>And they lamented that they had in wrath &amp; fury &amp; fire<br />
Driven Milton into the Ulro; for now they knew too late<br />
&#8220;That it was Milton the Awakener: they had not heard the Bard,&#8221;<br />
Whose song calld Milton to the attempt; and Los heard these laments.<br />
He heard them call in prayer all the Divine Family;<br />
And he beheld the Cloud of Milton stretching over Europe.</p>
<p>But all the Family Divine collected as Four Suns<br />
&#8220;In the Four Points of heaven East, West &amp; North &amp; South&#8221;<br />
Enlarging and enlarging till their Disks approachd each other;<br />
And when they touch&#8217;d closed together Southward in One Sun<br />
&#8220;Over Ololon: and as One Man, who weeps over his brother,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;In a dark tomb, so all the Family Divine. wept over Ololon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saying, Milton goes to Eternal Death! so saying, they groan&#8217;d in spirit&#8221;<br />
And were troubled! and again the Divine Family groaned in spirit!</p>
<p>&#8220;And Ololon said, Let us descend also, and let us give&#8221;<br />
Ourselves to death in Ulro among the Transgressors.<br />
Is Virtue a Punisher? O no! how is this wondrous thing?<br />
&#8220;This World beneath, unseen before: this refuge from the wars&#8221;<br />
Of Great Eternity! unnatural refuge! unknown by us till now!<br />
Or are these the pangs of repentance? let us enter into them</p>
<p>Then the Divine Family said. Six Thousand Years are now<br />
Accomplish&#8217;d in this World of Sorrow; Miltons Angel knew<br />
The Universal Dictate; and you also feel this Dictate.<br />
&#8220;And now you know this World of Sorrow, and feel Pity. Obey&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The Dictate! Watch over this World, and with your brooding wings,&#8221;<br />
Renew it to Eternal Life: Lo! I am with you alway<br />
But you cannot renew Milton he goes to Eternal Death</p>
<p>So spake the Family Divine as One Man even Jesus<br />
Uniting in One with Ololon &amp; the appearance of One Man<br />
Jesus the Saviour appeard coming in the Clouds of Ololon!</p>
<p>Tho driven away with the Seven Starry Ones into the Ulro<br />
Yet the Divine Vision remains Every-where For-ever. Amen.<br />
And Ololon lamented for Milton with a great lamentation.</p>
<p>&#8220;While Los heard indistinct in fear, what time I bound my sandals&#8221;<br />
&#8220;On; to walk forward thro&#8217; Eternity, Los descended to me:&#8221;<br />
And Los behind me stood; a terrible flaming Sun: just close</p>
<p>&#8220;Behind my back; I turned round in terror, and behold.&#8221;<br />
Los stood in that fierce glowing fire; &amp; he also stoop&#8217;d down<br />
And bound my sandals on in Udan-Adan; trembling I stood<br />
&#8220;Exceedingly with fear &amp; terror, standing in the Vale&#8221;<br />
Of Lambeth: but he kissed me and wishd me health.<br />
And I became One Man with him arising in my strength:<br />
Twas too late now to recede. Los had enterd into my soul:<br />
His terrors now posses&#8217;d me whole! I arose in fury &amp; strength.</p>
<p>I am that Shadowy Prophet who Six Thousand Years ago<br />
Fell from my station in the Eternal bosom. Six Thousand Years<br />
Are finishd. I return! both Time &amp; Space obey my will.<br />
I in Six Thousand Years walk up and down: for not one Moment<br />
&#8220;Of Time is lost, nor one Event of Space unpermanent&#8221;<br />
But all remain: every fabric of Six Thousand Years<br />
Remains permanent: tho&#8217; on the Earth where Satan<br />
&#8220;Fell, and was cut off all things vanish &amp; are seen no more&#8221;<br />
&#8220;They vanish not from me &amp; mine, we guard them first &amp; last&#8221;<br />
The generations of men run on in the tide of Time<br />
But leave their destind lineaments permanent for ever &amp; ever.</p>
