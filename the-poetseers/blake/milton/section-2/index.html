				<p>&#8220;So Los lamented over Satan, who triumphant divided the Nations&#8221;</p>
<p>He set his face against Jerusalem to destroy the Eon of Albion</p>
<p>&#8220;But Los hid Enitharmon from the sight of all these things,&#8221;<br />
Upon the Thames whose lulling harmony repos&#8217;d her soul:<br />
Where Beulah lovely terminates in rocky Albion:<br />
&#8220;Terminating in Hyde Park, on Tyburns awful brook.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the Mills of Satan were separated into a moony Space<br />
&#8220;Among the rocks of Albions Temples, and Satans Druid sons&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Offer the Human Victims throughout all the Earth, and Albions&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Dread Tomb immortal on his Rock, overshadowd the whole Earth:&#8221;<br />
Where Satan making to himself Laws from his own identity.<br />
Compell&#8217;d others to serve him in moral gratitude &amp; submission<br />
Being call&#8217;d God: setting himself above all that is called God.<br />
And all the Spectres of the Dead calling themselves Sons of God<br />
In his Synagogues worship Satan under the Unutterable Name</p>
<p>And it was enquir&#8217;d: Why in a Great Solemn Assembly<br />
The Innocent should be condemn&#8217;d for the Guilty? Then an Eternal rose<br />
&#8220;Saying. If the Guilty should be condemn&#8217;d, he must be an Eternal Death&#8221;<br />
And one must die for another throughout all Eternity.<br />
Satan is fall&#8217;n from his station &amp; never can be redeem&#8217;d<br />
But must be new created continually moment by moment<br />
&#8220;And therefore the Class of Satan shall be calld the Elect, &amp; those&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Of Rintrah. the Reprobate, &amp; those of Palamabron the Redeem&#8217;d&#8221;<br />
&#8220;For he is redeem&#8217;d from Satans Law, the wrath falling on Rintrah,&#8221;<br />
And therefore Palamabron dared not to call a solemn Assembly<br />
Till Satan had assum&#8217;d Rintrahs wrath in the day of mourning<br />
In a feminine delusion of false pride self-deciev&#8217;d.</p>
<p>So spake the Eternal and confirm&#8217;d it with a thunderous oath</p>
<p>But when Leutha a Daughter of Beulah) beheld Satans condemnation<br />
She down descended into the midst of the Great Solemn Assembly<br />
&#8220;Offering herself a Ransom for Satan, taking on her, his Sin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mark well my words. they are of your eternal salvation!</p>
<p>&#8220;And Leutha stood glowing with varying colours immortal, heart-piercing&#8221;<br />
And lovely: &amp; her moth-like elegance shone over the Assembly</p>
<p>At length standing upon the golden floor of Palamabron<br />
She spake: I am the Author of this Sin! by my suggestion<br />
My Parent power Satan has committed this transgression.<br />
&#8220;I loved Palamabron &amp; I sought to approach his Tent,&#8221;<br />
But beautiful Elynittria with her silver arrows repelld me.</p>
<p>For her light is terrible to me. I fade before her immortal beauty.<br />
O wherefore doth a Dragon-form forth issue from my limbs<br />
To sieze her new born son? Ah me! the wretched Leutha!<br />
&#8220;This to prevent, entering the doors of Satans brain night after night&#8221;<br />
Like sweet perfumes I stupified the masculine perceptions<br />
&#8220;And kept only the feminine awake, hence rose his soft&#8221;<br />
Delusory love to Palamabron: admiration join&#8217;d with envy<br />
&#8220;Cupidity unconquerable! my fault, when at noon of day&#8221;<br />
The Horses of Palamabron call&#8217;d for rest and pleasant death:<br />
&#8220;I sprang out of the breast of Satan, over the Harrow beaming&#8221;<br />
In all my beauty! that I might unloose the flaming steeds<br />
As Elynittria use&#8217;d to do; but too well those living creatures<br />
&#8220;Knew that I was not Elynittria, and they brake the traces&#8221;<br />
&#8220;But me, the servants of the Harrow saw not: but as a bow&#8221;<br />
Of varying colours on the hills; terribly rag&#8217;d the horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Satan astonishd, and with power above his own controll&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Compell&#8217;d the Gnomes to curb the horses, &amp; to throw banks of sand&#8221;<br />
Around the fiery flaming Harrow in labyrinthine forms.<br />
And brooks between to intersect the meadows in their course.<br />
The Harrow cast thick flames: Jehovah thunderd above:<br />
Chaos &amp; ancient night fled from beneath the fiery Harrow:<br />
The Harrow cast thick flames &amp; orb&#8217;d us round in concave fires<br />
&#8220;A Hell of our own making. see, its flames still gird me round.&#8221;<br />
Jehovah thunder&#8217;d above! Satan in pride of heart<br />
Drove the fierce Harrow among the constellations of Jehovah<br />
Drawing a third part in the fires as stubble north &amp; south<br />
To devour Albion and Jerusalem the Emanation of Albion<br />
&#8220;Driving the Harrow in Pitys paths. &#8217;twas then, with our dark fires&#8221;<br />
Which now gird round us (O eternal torment) I form&#8217;d the Serpent<br />
Of precious stones &amp; gold turn&#8217;d poisons on the sultry wastes<br />
The Gnomes in all that day spar&#8217;d not; they curs&#8217;d Satan bitterly.<br />
&#8220;To do unkind things in kindness! with power armd, to say&#8221;<br />
The most irritating things in the midst of tears and love<br />
These are the stings of the Serpent! thus did we by them; till thus<br />
&#8220;They in return retaliated, and the Living Creatures maddend.&#8221;<br />
The Gnomes labourd. I weeping hid in Satans inmost brain;<br />
&#8220;But when the Gnomes refus&#8217;d to labour more, with blandishments&#8221;<br />
I came forth from the head of Satan! back the Gnomes recoil&#8217;d.<br />
&#8220;And call&#8217;d me Sin, and for a sign portentous held me. Soon&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Day sunk and Palamabron return&#8217;d, trembling I hid myself&#8221;<br />
In Satans inmost Palace of his nervous fine wrought Brain:<br />
For Elynittria met Satan with all her singing women.<br />
Terrific in their joy &amp; pouring wine of wildest power<br />
They gave Satan their wine: indignant at the burning wrath.<br />
Wild with prophetic fury his former life became like a dream<br />
&#8220;Cloth&#8217;d in the Serpents folds, in selfish holiness demanding purity&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Being Most impure, self-condemn&#8217;d to eternal tears, he drove&#8221;<br />
Me from his inmost Brain &amp; the doors clos&#8217;d with thunders sound<br />
O Divine Vision who didst create the Female: to repose<br />
The Sleepers of Beulah: pity the repentant Leutha. My</p>
<p>Sick Couch bears the dark shades of Eternal Death infolding<br />
The Spectre of Satan. he furious refuses to repose in sleep<br />
I humbly bow in all my Sin before the Throne Divine.<br />
Not so the Sick-one; Alas what shall be done him to restore?<br />
&#8220;Who calls the Individual Law, Holy: and despises the Saviour.&#8221;<br />
Glorying to involve Albions Body in fires of eternal War&#8211;</p>
<p>Now Leutha ceas&#8217;d: tears flow&#8217;d: but the Divine Pity supported her.</p>
<p>All is my fault! We are the Spectre of Luvah the murderer.<br />
Of Albion: O Vala! O Luvah! O Albion! O lovely Jerusalem</p>
<p>&#8220;The Sin was begun in Eternity, and will not rest to Eternity&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Till two Eternitys meet together, Ah! lost! lost! lost! for ever!&#8221;</p>
<p>So Leutha spoke. But when she saw that Enitharmon had<br />
Created a New Space to protect Satan from punishment;<br />
She fled to Enitharmons Tent &amp; hid herself. Loud raging<br />
&#8220;Thundered the Assembly dark &amp; clouded, and they ratify&#8217;d&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The kind decision of Enitharmon &amp; gave a Time to the Space,&#8221;<br />
Even Six Thousand years; and sent Lucifer for its Guard.<br />
But Lucifer refus&#8217;d to die &amp; in pride he forsook his charge<br />
&#8220;And they elected Molech, and when Molech was impatient&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The Divine hand found the Two Limits: first of Opacity, then of Contraction&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Opacity was named Satan, Contraction was named Adam.&#8221;<br />
Triple Elohim came: Elohim wearied fainted: they elected Shaddai.<br />
&#8220;Shaddai angry, Pahad descended: Pahad terrified, they sent Jehovah&#8221;<br />
&#8220;And Jehovah was leprous; loud he call&#8217;d, stretching his hand to Eternity&#8221;<br />
&#8220;For then the Body of Death was perfected in hypocritic holiness,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Around the Lamb, a Female Tabernacle woven in Cathedrons Looms&#8221;<br />
He died as a Reprobate. he was Punish&#8217;d as a Transgressor!<br />
Glory! Glory! Glory! to the Holy Lamb of God<br />
I touch the heavens as an instrument to glorify the Lord!</p>
<p>The Elect shall meet the Redeem&#8217;d. on Albions rocks they shall meet<br />
&#8220;Astonish&#8217;d at the Transgressor, in him beholding the Saviour.&#8221;<br />
And the Elect shall say to the Redeemd. We behold it is of Divine<br />
Mercy alone! of Free Gift and Election that we live.<br />
&#8220;Our Virtues &amp; Cruel Goodnesses, have deserv&#8217;d Eternal Death.&#8221;<br />
Thus they weep upon the fatal Brook of Albions River.</p>
<p>But Elynittria met Leutha in the place where she was hidden.<br />
&#8220;And threw aside her arrows, and laid down her sounding Bow;&#8221;<br />
She sooth&#8217;d her with soft words &amp; brought her to Palamabrons bed<br />
&#8220;In moments new created for delusion, interwoven round about,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;In dreams she bore the shadowy Spectre of Sleep, &amp; namd him Death.&#8221;<br />
In dreams she bore Rahab the mother of Tirzah &amp; her sisters<br />
&#8220;In Lambeths vales; in Cambridge &amp; in Oxford, places of Thought&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Intricate labyrinths of Times and Spaces unknown, that Leutha lived&#8221;<br />
&#8220;In Palamabrons Tent, and Oothoon was her charming guard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bard ceas&#8217;d. All consider&#8217;d and a loud resounding murmur<br />
Continu&#8217;d round the Halls; and much they question&#8217;d the immortal<br />
Loud voicd Bard. and many condemn&#8217;d the high tone&#8217;d Song<br />
Saying Pity and Love are too venerable for the imputation<br />
Of Guilt. Others said. It it is true! if the acts have been perform&#8217;d<br />
Let the Bard himself witness. Where hadst thou this terrible Song</p>
<p>The Bard replied. I am Inspired! I know it is Truth! for I Sing</p>
<p>According to the inspiration of the Poetic Genius<br />
Who is the eternal all-protecting Divine Humanity<br />
To whom be Glory &amp; Power &amp; Dominion Evermore Amen</p>
<p>Then there was great murmuring in the Heavens of Albion<br />
Concerning Generation &amp; the Vegetative power &amp; concerning<br />
The Lamb the Saviour: Albion trembled to Italy Greece &amp; Egypt<br />
To Tartary &amp; Hindostan &amp; China &amp; to Great America<br />
Shaking the roots &amp; fast foundations of the Earth in doubtfulness<br />
The loud voic&#8217;d Bard terrify&#8217;d took refuge in Miltons bosom</p>
<p>Then Milton rose up from the heavens of Albion ardorous!<br />
&#8220;The whole Assembly wept prophetic, seeing in Miltons face&#8221;<br />
And in his lineaments divine the shades of Death &amp; Ulro<br />
&#8220;He took off the robe of the promise, &amp; ungirded himself from the oath of God&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Milton said, I go to Eternal Death! The Nations still&#8221;<br />
Follow after the detestable Gods of Priam; in pomp<br />
&#8220;Of warlike selfhood, contradicting and blaspheming.&#8221;<br />
When will the Resurrection come; to deliver the sleeping body<br />
From corruptibility: O when Lord Jesus wilt thou come?<br />
Tarry no longer; for my soul lies at the gates of death.<br />
I will arise and look forth for the morning of the grave.<br />
I will go down to the sepulcher to see if morning breaks!<br />
&#8220;I will go down to self annihilation and eternal death,&#8221;<br />
Lest the Last Judgment come &amp; find me unannihilate<br />
And I be siez&#8217;d &amp; giv&#8217;n into the hands of my own Selfhood<br />
&#8220;The Lamb of God is seen thro&#8217; mists &amp; shadows, hov&#8217;ring&#8221;<br />
Over the sepulchers in clouds of Jehovah &amp; winds of Elohim<br />
&#8220;A disk of blood, distant; &amp; heav&#8217;ns &amp; earth&#8217;s roll dark between&#8221;<br />
What do I here before the Judgment? without my Emanation?<br />
&#8220;With the daughters of memory, &amp; not with the daughters of inspiration[?]&#8220;<br />
I in my Selfhood am that Satan: I am that Evil One!<br />
He is my Spectre! in my obedience to loose him from my Hells<br />
&#8220;To claim the Hells, my Furnaces, I go to Eternal Death.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Milton said. I go to Eternal Death! Eternity shudder&#8217;d<br />
&#8220;For he took the outside course, among the graves of the dead&#8221;<br />
A mournful shade. Eternity shudderd at the image of eternal death</p>
<p>Then on the verge of Beulah he beheld his own Shadow;<br />
A mournful form double; hermaphroditic: male &amp; female<br />
In one wonderful body. and he enterd into it<br />
&#8220;In direful pain for the dread shadow, twenty-seven-fold&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reachd to the depths of direst Hell, &amp; thence to Albions land:&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Which is this earth of vegetation on which now I write,&#8221;</p>
<p>The Seven Angels of the Presence wept over Miltons Shadow!</p>
<p>&#8220;As when a man dreams, he reflects not that his body sleeps,&#8221;<br />
Else he would wake; so seem&#8217;d he entering his Shadow: but<br />
With him the Spirits of the Seven Angels of the Presence<br />
Entering; they gave him still perceptions of his Sleeping Body;<br />
&#8220;Which now arose and walk&#8217;d with them in Eden, as an Eighth&#8221;<br />
Image Divine tho&#8217; darken&#8217;d; and tho walking as one walks<br />
In sleep; and the Seven comforted and supported him.</p>
<p>Like as a Polypus that vegetates beneath the deep!<br />
They saw his Shadow vegetated underneath the Couch<br />
Of death: for when he enterd into his Shadow: Himself:<br />
His real and immortal Self: was as appeard to those<br />
&#8220;Who dwell in immortality, as One sleeping on a couch&#8221;<br />
Of gold; and those in immortality gave forth their Emanations<br />
&#8220;Like Females of sweet beauty, to guard round him &amp; to feed&#8221;<br />
His lips with food of Eden in his cold and dim repose!<br />
But to himself he seemd a wanderer lost in dreary night.</p>
<p>Onwards his Shadow kept its course among the Spectres; call&#8217;d<br />
&#8220;Satan, but swift as lightning passing them, startled the shades&#8221;<br />
Of Hell beheld him in a trail of light as of a comet<br />
That travels into Chaos: so Milton went guarded within.</p>
<p>The nature of infinity is this: That every thing has its<br />
Own Vortex; and when once a traveller thro Eternity.<br />
&#8220;Has passd that Vortex, he percieves it roll backward behind&#8221;<br />
&#8220;His path, into a globe itself infolding; like a sun:&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Or like a moon, or like a universe of starry majesty,&#8221;<br />
While he keeps onwards in his wondrous journey on the earth<br />
&#8220;Or like a human form, a friend with whom he livd benevolent.&#8221;<br />
As the eye of man views both the east &amp; west encompassing<br />
&#8220;Its vortex; and the north &amp; south, with all their starry host;&#8221;<br />
Also the rising sun &amp; setting moon he views surrounding<br />
His corn-fields and his valleys of five hundred acres square.<br />
&#8220;Thus is the earth one infinite plane, and not as apparent&#8221;<br />
To the weak traveller confin&#8217;d beneath the moony shade.<br />
&#8220;Thus is the heaven a vortex passd already, and the earth&#8221;<br />
A vortex not yet pass&#8217;d by the traveller thro&#8217; Eternity.</p>
<p>&#8220;First Milton saw Albion upon the Rock of Ages,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Deadly pale outstretchd and snowy cold, storm coverd;&#8221;<br />
A Giant form of perfect beauty outstretchd on the rock</p>
<p>In solemn death: the Sea of Time &amp; Space thunderd aloud<br />
&#8220;Against the rock, which was inwrapped with the weeds of death&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Hovering over the cold bosom, in its vortex Milton bent down&#8221;<br />
&#8220;To the bosom of death, what was underneath soon seemd above.&#8221;<br />
A cloudy heaven mingled with stormy seas in loudest ruin;<br />
&#8220;But as a wintry globe descends precipitant thro&#8217; Beulah bursting,&#8221;<br />
With thunders loud and terrible: so Miltons shadow fell<br />
Precipitant loud thundring into the Sea of Time &amp; Space.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then first I saw him in the Zenith as a falling star,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Descending perpendicular, swift as the swallow or swift;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;And on my left foot falling on the tarsus, enterd there;&#8221;<br />
But from my left foot a black cloud redounding spread over Europe.</p>
<p>Then Milton knew that the Three Heavens of Beulah were beheld<br />
By him on earth in his bright pilgrimage of sixty years</p>
<p>Full-page design. For caption see Textual Note.]</p>
<p>&#8220;In those three females whom his Wives, &amp; those three whom his Daughters&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Had represented and containd, that they might be resum&#8217;d&#8221;<br />
By giving up of Selfhood: &amp; they distant view&#8217;d his journey<br />
&#8220;In their eternal spheres, now Human, tho&#8217; their Bodies remain clos&#8217;d&#8221;<br />
In the dark Ulro till the Judgment: also Milton knew: they and<br />
&#8220;Himself was Human, tho&#8217; now wandering thro Death&#8217;s Vale&#8221;<br />
&#8220;In conflict with those Female forms, which in blood &amp; jealousy&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Surrounded him, dividing &amp; uniting without end or number.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He saw the Cruelties of Ulro, and he wrote them down&#8221;<br />
In iron tablets: and his Wives &amp; Daughters names were these<br />
&#8220;Rahab and Tirzah, &amp; Milcah &amp; Malah &amp; Noah &amp; Hoglah,&#8221;<br />
They sat rangd round him as the rocks of Horeb round the land<br />
Of Canaan: and they wrote in thunder smoke and fire<br />
&#8220;His dictate; and his body was the Rock Sinai; that body,&#8221;<br />
Which was on earth born to corruption: &amp; the six Females<br />
Are Hor &amp; Peor &amp; Bashan &amp; Abarim &amp; Lebanon &amp; Hermon<br />
Seven rocky masses terrible in the Desarts of Midian.</p>
<p>But Miltons Human Shadow continu&#8217;d journeying above<br />
The rocky masses of The Mundane Shell; in the Lands<br />
Of Edom &amp; Aram &amp; Moab &amp; Midian &amp; Amalek.</p>
