				<p>So spoke Los as we went along to his supreme abode.</p>
<p>Rintrah and Palamabron met us at the Gate of Golgonooza<br />
Clouded with discontent. &amp; brooding in their minds terrible things</p>
<p>They said. O Father most beloved! O merciful Parent!<br />
&#8220;Pitying and permitting evil, tho strong &amp; mighty to destroy.&#8221;<br />
Whence is this Shadow terrible? wherefore dost thou refuse<br />
To throw him into the Furnaces! knowest thou not that he<br />
&#8220;Will unchain Orc? &amp; let loose Satan, Og, Sihon &amp; Anak,&#8221;<br />
Upon the Body of Albion? for this he is come! behold it written<br />
Upon his fibrous left Foot black! most dismal to our eyes t229<br />
The Shadowy Female shudders thro&#8217; heaven in torment inexpressible!<br />
&#8220;And all the Daughters of Los prophetic wail: yet in deceit,&#8221;<br />
They weave a new Religion from new Jealousy of Theotormon!<br />
Miltons Religion is the cause: there is no end to destruction!<br />
Seeing the Churches at their Period in terror &amp; despair:<br />
Rahab created Voltaire; Tirzah created Rousseau;<br />
&#8220;Asserting the Self-righteousness against the Universal Saviour,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Mocking the Confessors &amp; Martyrs, claiming Self-righteousness;&#8221;<br />
With cruel Virtue: making War upon the Lambs Redeemed;<br />
To perpetuate War &amp; Glory. to perpetuate the Laws of Sin:<br />
They perverted Swedenborgs Visions in Beulah &amp; in Ulro;<br />
To destroy Jerusalem as a Harlot &amp; her Sons as Reprobates;<br />
&#8220;To raise up Mystery the Virgin Harlot Mother of War,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Babylon the Great, the Abomination of Desolation!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;O Swedenborg! strongest of men, the Samson shorn by the Churches!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shewing the Transgresors in Hell, the proud Warriors in Heaven:&#8221;<br />
Heaven as a Punisher &amp; Hell as One under Punishment:<br />
&#8220;With Laws from Plato &amp; his Greeks to renew the Trojan Gods,&#8221;<br />
In Albion; &amp; to deny the value of the Saviours blood.<br />
&#8220;But then I rais&#8217;d up Whitefield, Palamabron raisd up Westley,&#8221;<br />
And these are the cries of the Churches before the two Witnesses['] t230<br />
Faith in God the dear Saviour who took on the likeness of men:<br />
&#8220;Becoming obedient to death, even the death of the Cross&#8221;<br />
The Witnesses lie dead in the Street of the Great City<br />
No Faith is in all the Earth: the Book of God is trodden under Foot:<br />
He sent his two Servants Whitefield &amp; Westley; were they Prophets<br />
Or were they Idiots or Madmen? shew us Miracles!</p>
<p>Can you have greater Miracles than these? Men who devote<br />
Their lifes whole comfort to intire scorn &amp; injury &amp; death<br />
Awake thou sleeper on the Rock of Eternity Albion awake<br />
The trumpet of Judgment hath twice sounded: all Nations are awake<br />
But thou art still heavy and dull: Awake Albion awake! t231<br />
Lo Orc arises on the Atlantic. Lo his blood and fire<br />
Glow on Americas shore: Albion turns upon his Couch<br />
&#8220;He listens to the sounds of War, astonishd and confounded:&#8221;<br />
&#8220;He weeps into the Atlantic deep, yet still in dismal dreams&#8221;<br />
Unwakend! and the Covering Cherub advances from the East:<br />
How long shall we lay dead in the Street of the great City<br />
How long beneath the Covering Cherub give our Emanations<br />
Milton will utterly consume us &amp; thee our beloved Father<br />
&#8220;He hath enterd into the Covering Cherub, becoming one with&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Albions dread Sons, Hand, Hyle &amp; Coban surround him as&#8221;<br />
A girdle; Gwendolen &amp; Conwenna as a garment woven<br />
Of War &amp; Religion; let us descend &amp; bring him chained<br />
To Bowlahoola O father most beloved! O mild Parent!<br />
&#8220;Cruel in thy mildness, pitying and permitting evil&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Tho strong and mighty to destroy, O Los our beloved Father!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like the black storm, coming out of Chaos, beyond the stars:&#8221;<br />
It issues thro the dark &amp; intricate caves of the Mundane Shell<br />
&#8220;Passing the planetary visions, &amp; the well adorned Firmament&#8221;<br />
The Sun rolls into Chaos &amp; the Stars into the Desarts;<br />
&#8220;And then the storms become visible, audible &amp; terrible,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Covering the light of day, &amp; rolling down upon the mountains,&#8221;<br />
Deluge all the country round. Such is a vision of Los;<br />
When Rintrah &amp; Palamabron spake; and such his stormy face<br />
&#8220;Appeard, as does the face of heaven, when coverd with thick storms&#8221;<br />
Pitying and loving tho in frowns of terrible perturbation t232</p>
<p>&#8220;But Los dispersd the clouds even as the strong winds of Jehovah,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Los thus spoke. O noble Sons, be patient yet a little&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I have embracd the falling Death, he is become One with me&#8221;<br />
O Sons we live not by wrath. by mercy alone we live!<br />
I recollect an old Prophecy in Eden recorded in gold; and oft<br />
Sung to the harp: That Milton of the land of Albion.<br />
Should up ascend forward from Felphams Vale &amp; break the Chain<br />
Of jealousy from all its roots; be patient therefore O my Sons<br />
These lovely Females form sweet night and silence and secret<br />
Obscurities to hide from Satans Watch-Fiends. Human loves<br />
&#8220;And graces; lest they write them in their Books, &amp; in the Scroll&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Of mortal life, to condemn the accused: who at Satans Bar&#8221;<br />
Tremble in Spectrous Bodies continually day and night<br />
While on the Earth they live in sorrowful Vegetations<br />
O when shall we tread our Wine-presses in heaven; and Reap<br />
&#8220;Our wheat with shoutings of joy, and leave the Earth in peace&#8221;<br />
Remember how Calvin and Luther in fury premature<br />
Sow&#8217;d War and stern division between Papists &amp; Protestants<br />
Let it not be so now! O go not forth in Martyrdoms &amp; Wars<br />
We were plac&#8217;d here by the Universal Brotherhood &amp; Mercy<br />
With powers fitted to circumscribe this dark Satanic death<br />
And that the Seven Eyes of God may have space for Redemption.<br />
&#8220;But how this is as yet we know not, and we cannot know;&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Till Albion is arisen; then patient wait a little while,&#8221;<br />
Six Thousand years are passd away the end approaches fast;<br />
&#8220;This mighty one is come from Eden, he is of the Elect,&#8221;<br />
Who died from Earth &amp; he is returnd before the Judgment. This thing<br />
Was never known that one of the holy dead should willing return<br />
Then patient wait a little while till the Last Vintage is over:<br />
Till we have quenchd the Sun of Salah in the Lake of Udan Adan<br />
&#8220;O my dear Sons! leave not your Father, as your brethren left me[.]&#8220;<br />
Twelve Sons successive fled away in that thousand years of sorrow</p>
<p>&#8220;Of Palamabrons Harrow, &amp; of Rintrahs wrath &amp; fury:&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Reuben &amp; Manazzoth &amp; Gad &amp; Simeon &amp; Levi,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;And Ephraim &amp; Judah were Generated, because&#8221;<br />
&#8220;They left me, wandering with Tirzah: Enitharmon wept&#8221;<br />
&#8220;One thousand years, and all the Earth was in a watry deluge&#8221;<br />
We calld him Menassheh because of the Generations of Tirzah<br />
Because of Satan: &amp; the Seven Eyes of God continually<br />
&#8220;Guard round them, but I the Fourth Zoa am also set&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The Watchman of Eternity, the Three are not! &amp; I am preserved&#8221;<br />
Still my four mighty ones are let to me in Golgonooza<br />
&#8220;Still Rintrah fierce, and Palamabron mild &amp; piteous&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Theotormon filld with care, Bromion loving Science&#8221;</p>
<p>You O my Sons still guard round Los. O wander not &amp; leave me<br />
&#8220;Rintrah, thou well rememberest when Amalek &amp; Canaan&#8221;<br />
Fled with their Sister Moab into the abhorred Void<br />
They became Nations in our sight beneath the hands of Tirzah.<br />
And Palamabron thou rememberest when Joseph an infant;<br />
Stolen from his nurses cradle wrapd in needle-work<br />
&#8220;Of emblematic texture, was sold to the Amalekite,&#8221;<br />
Who carried him down into Egypt where Ephraim &amp; Menassheh<br />
Gatherd my Sons together in the Sands of Midian<br />
&#8220;And if you also flee away and leave your Fathers side,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Following Milton into Ulro, altho your power is great&#8221;<br />
Surely you also shall become poor mortal vegetations<br />
Beneath the Moon of Ulro: pity then your Fathers tears[.]<br />
When Jesus raisd Lazarus from the Grave I stood &amp; saw<br />
Lazarus who is the Vehicular Body of Albion the Redeemd<br />
Arise into the Covering Cherub who is the Spectre of Albion<br />
By martyrdoms to suffer: to watch over the Sleeping Body.<br />
Upon his Rock beneath his Tomb. I saw the Covering Cherub<br />
Divide Four-fold into Four Churches when Lazarus arose<br />
&#8220;Paul, Constantine, Charlemaine, Luther; behold they stand before us&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Stretchd over Europe &amp; Asia. come O Sons, come, come away&#8221;<br />
Arise O Sons give all your strength against Eternal Death<br />
&#8220;Lest we are vegetated, for Cathedrons Looms weave only Death&#8221;<br />
A Web of Death: &amp; were it not for Bowlahoola &amp; Allamanda<br />
No Human Form but only a Fibrous Vegetation<br />
A Polypus of soft affections without Thought or Vision<br />
Must tremble in the Heavens &amp; Earths thro all the Ulro space[.]<br />
Throw all the Vegetated Mortals into Bowlahoola<br />
But as to this Elected Form who is returnd again<br />
He is the Signal that the Last Vintage now approaches<br />
Nor Vegetation may go on till all the Earth is reapd</p>
<p>So Los spoke. Furious they descended to Bowlahoola &amp; Allamanda<br />
Indignant. unconvincd by Los&#8217;s arguments &amp; thun[d]ers rolling<br />
They saw that wrath now swayd and now pity absorbd him<br />
&#8220;As it was, so it remaind &amp; no hope of an end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bowlahoola is namd Law. by mortals, Tharmas founded it:&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Because of Satan, before Luban in the City of Golgonooza.&#8221;<br />
But Golgonooza is namd Art &amp; Manufacture by mortal men.</p>
<p>In Bowlahoola Los&#8217;s Anvils stand &amp; his Furnaces rage;<br />
Thundering the Hammers beat &amp; the Bellows blow loud<br />
Living self moving mourning lamenting &amp; howling incessantly<br />
Bowlahoola thro all its porches feels tho&#8217; too fast founded<br />
Its pillars &amp; porticoes to tremble at the force</p>
<p>Of mortal or immortal arm: and softly lilling flutes<br />
Accordant with the horrid labours make sweet melody t233</p>
<p>The Bellows are the Animal Lungs: the Hammers the Animal Heart<br />
The Furnaces the Stomach for digestion. terrible their fury<br />
Thousands &amp; thousands labour. thousands play on instruments<br />
Stringed or fluted to ameliorate the sorrows of slavery<br />
&#8220;Loud sport the dancers in the dance of death, rejoicing in carnage&#8221;<br />
The hard dentant Hammers are lulld by the flutes['] lula lula<br />
The bellowing Furnaces['] blare by the long sounding clarion t234<br />
&#8220;The double drum drowns howls &amp; groans, the shrill fife. shrieks &amp; cries:&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The crooked horn mellows the hoarse raving serpent, terrible, but harmonious t235&#8243;</p>
<p>Bowlahoola is the Stomach in every individual man.</p>
<p>Los is by mortals nam&#8217;d Time Enitharmon is nam&#8217;d Space<br />
But they depict him bald &amp; aged who is in eternal youth<br />
All powerful and his locks flourish like the brows of morning<br />
He is the Spirit of Prophecy the ever apparent Elias<br />
Time is the mercy of Eternity; without Times swiftness<br />
Which is the swiftest of all things: all were eternal torment:<br />
All the Gods of the Kingdoms of Earth labour in Los&#8217;s Halls.<br />
Every one is a fallen Son of the Spirit of Prophecy<br />
&#8220;He is the Fourth Zoa, that stood arou[n]d the Throne Divine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Loud shout the Sons of Luvah, at the Wine-presses as Los descended&#8221;<br />
With Rintrah &amp; Palamabron in his fires of resistless fury.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Wine-press on the Rhine groans loud, but all its central beams&#8221;<br />
Act more terrific in the central Cities of the Nations<br />
Where Human Thought is crushd beneath the iron hand of Power.<br />
&#8220;There Los puts all into the Press, the Opressor &amp; the Opressed&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Together, ripe for the Harvest &amp; Vintage &amp; ready for the Loom.&#8221;</p>
<p>They sang at the Vintage. This is the Last Vintage! &amp; Seed<br />
&#8220;Shall no more be sown upon Earth, till all the Vintage is over&#8221;<br />
&#8220;And all gatherd in, till the Plow has passd over the Nations&#8221;<br />
And the Harrow &amp; heavy thundering Roller upon the mountains</p>
<p>And loud the Souls howl round the Porches of Golgonooza<br />
&#8220;Crying O God deliver us to the Heavens or to the Earths,&#8221;<br />
That we may preach righteousness &amp; punish the sinner with death<br />
&#8220;But Los refused, till all the Vintage of Earth was gatherd in.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Los stood &amp; cried to the Labourers of the Vintage in voice of awe.</p>
<p>Fellow Labourers! The Great Vintage &amp; Harvest is now upon Earth<br />
The whole extent of the Globe is explored: Every scatterd Atom<br />
Of Human Intellect now is flocking to the sound of the Trumpet<br />
&#8220;All the Wisdom which was hidden in caves &amp; dens, from ancient&#8221;<br />
Time; is now sought out from Animal &amp; Vegetable &amp; Mineral</p>
<p>The Awakener is come. outstretchd over Europe! the Vision of God is fulfilled<br />
&#8220;The Ancient Man upon the Rock of Albion Awakes,&#8221;<br />
He listens to the sounds of War astonishd &amp; ashamed;<br />
He sees his Children mock at Faith and deny Providence<br />
Therefore you must bind the Sheaves not by Nations or Families<br />
You shall bind them in Three Classes; according to their Classes<br />
So shall you bind them. Separating What has been Mixed<br />
Since Men began to be Wove into Nations by Rahab &amp; Tirzah<br />
Since Albions Death &amp; Satans Cutting-off from our awful Fields;<br />
When under pretence to benevolence the Elect Subdud All<br />
From the Foundation of the World. The Elect is one Class: You<br />
Shall bind them separate: they cannot Believe in Eternal Life<br />
Except by Miracle &amp; a New Birth. The other two Classes;<br />
&#8220;The Reprobate who never cease to Believe, and the Redeemd,&#8221;<br />
Who live in doubts &amp; fears perpetually tormented by the Elect<br />
These you shall bind in a twin-bundle for the Consummation&#8211;<br />
&#8220;But the Elect must be saved [from] fires of Eternal Death,&#8221;<br />
To be formed into the Churches of Beulah that they destroy not the Earth<br />
For in every Nation &amp; every Family the Three Classes are born<br />
&#8220;And in every Species of Earth, Metal, Tree, Fish, Bird &amp; Beast.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;We form the Mundane Egg, that Spectres coming by fury or amity&#8221;<br />
&#8220;All is the same, &amp; every one remains in his own energy&#8221;<br />
Go forth Reapers with rejoicing. you sowed in tears<br />
&#8220;But the time of your refreshing cometh, only a little moment&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Still abstain from pleasure &amp; rest, in the labours of eternity&#8221;<br />
&#8220;And you shall Reap the whole Earth, from Pole to Pole! from Sea to Sea&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Begining at Jerusalems Inner Court, Lambeth ruin&#8217;d and given&#8221;<br />
&#8220;To the detestable Gods of Priam, to Apollo: and at the Asylum&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Given to Hercules, who labour in Tirzahs Looms for bread&#8221;<br />
Who set Pleasure against Duty: who Create Olympic crowns<br />
To make Learning a burden &amp; the Work of the Holy Spirit: Strife.<br />
T[o] Thor &amp; cruel Odin who first reard the Polar Caves t236<br />
Lambeth mourns calling Jerusalem. she weeps &amp; looks abroad<br />
&#8220;For the Lords coming, that Jerusalem may overspread all Nations&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Crave not for the mortal &amp; perishing delights, but leave them&#8221;<br />
&#8220;To the weak, and pity the weak as your infant care; Break not&#8221;<br />
Forth in your wrath lest you also are vegetated by Tirzah<br />
&#8220;Wait till the Judgement is past, till the Creation is consumed&#8221;<br />
And then rush forward with me into the glorious spiritual<br />
Vegetation; the Supper of the Lamb &amp; his Bride; and the<br />
Awaking of Albion our friend and ancient companion.</p>
<p>So Los spoke. But lightnings of discontent broke on all sides round<br />
And murmurs of thunder rolling heavy long &amp; loud over the mountains<br />
While Los calld his Sons around him to the Harvest &amp; the Vintage.</p>
<p>Thou seest the Constellations in the deep &amp; wondrous Night<br />
They rise in order and continue their immortal courses<br />
Upon the mountains &amp; in vales with harp &amp; heavenly song<br />
With flute &amp; clarion; with cups &amp; measures filld with foaming wine.<br />
&#8220;Glittring the streams reflect the Vision of beatitude,&#8221;<br />
And the calm Ocean joys beneath &amp; smooths his awful waves!</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the Sons of Los, &amp; these the Labourers of the Vintage&#8221;<br />
Thou seest the gorgeous clothed Flies that dance &amp; sport in summer<br />
Upon the sunny brooks &amp; meadows: every one the dance t237<br />
Knows in its intricate mazes of delight artful to weave:<br />
&#8220;Each one to sound his instruments of music in the dance,&#8221;<br />
To touch each other &amp; recede; to cross &amp; change &amp; return<br />
These are the Children of Los; thou seest the Trees on mountains<br />
&#8220;The wind blows heavy, loud they thunder thro&#8217; the darksom sky&#8221;<br />
Uttering prophecies &amp; speaking instructive words to the sons<br />
Of men: These are the Sons of Los! These the Visions of Eternity</p>
<p>But we see only as it were the hem of their garments<br />
When with our vegetable eyes we view these wond&#8217;rous Visions</p>
<p>There are Two Gates thro which all Souls descend. One Southward<br />
From Dover Cliff o Lizard Point. the other toward the North<br />
&#8220;Caithness &amp; rocky Durness, Pentland &amp; John Groats House.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Souls descending to the Body, wail on the right hand&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Of Los; &amp; those deliverd from the Body, on the left hand&#8221;<br />
For Los against the east his force continually bends<br />
Along the Valleys of Middlesex from Hounslow to Blackheath<br />
Lest those Three Heavens of Beulah should the Creation destroy<br />
And lest they should descend before the north &amp; south Gates<br />
&#8220;Groaning with pity, he among the wailing Souls laments.&#8221;</p>
<p>And these the Labours of the Sons of Los in Allamanda:<br />
And in the City of Golgonooza: &amp; in Luban: &amp; around<br />
&#8220;The Lake of Udan-Adan, in the Forests of Entuthon Benython&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Where Souls incessant wail, being piteous Passions &amp; Desires&#8221;<br />
With neither lineament nor form but like to watry clouds<br />
The Passions &amp; Desires descend upon the hungry winds<br />
For such alone Sleepers remain meer passion &amp; appetite;<br />
The Sons of Los clothe them &amp; feed &amp; provide houses &amp; fields</p>
<p>&#8220;And every Generated Body in its inward form,&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Is a garden of delight &amp; a building of magnificence,&#8221;<br />
Built by the Sons of Los in Bowlahoola &amp; Allamanda<br />
And the herbs &amp; flowers &amp; furniture &amp; beds &amp; chambers<br />
Continually woven in the Looms of Enitharmons Daughters<br />
In bright Cathedrons golden Dome with care &amp; love &amp; tears<br />
For the various Classes of Men are all markd out determinate</p>
<p>In Bowlahoola; &amp; as the Spectres choose their affinities<br />
&#8220;So they are born on Earth, &amp; every Class is determinate&#8221;<br />
But not by Natural but by Spiritual power alone. Because<br />
The Natural power continually seeks &amp; tends to Destruction<br />
Ending in Death: which would of itself be Eternal Death<br />
&#8220;And all are Class&#8217;d by Spiritual, &amp; not by Natural power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And every Natural Effect has a Spiritual Cause, and Not&#8221;<br />
&#8220;A Natural: for a Natural Cause only seems, it is Delusion&#8221;<br />
Of Ulro: &amp; a ratio of the perishing Vegetable Memory.</p>
