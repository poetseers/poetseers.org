				<p>
I, WHO erewhile the happy Garden sung<br />
By one man&#8217;s disobedience lost, now sing<br />
Recovered Paradise to all mankind,<br />
By one man&#8217;s firm obedience fully tried<br />
Through all temptation, and the Tempter foiled<br />
In all his wiles, defeated and repulsed,<br />
And Eden raised in the waste Wilderness.</p>
<p>Thou Spirit, who led&#8217;st this glorious Eremite<br />
Into the desert, his victorious field<br />
Against the spiritual foe, and brought&#8217;st him thence<br />
By proof the undoubted Son of God, inspire,<br />
As thou art wont, my prompted song, else mute,<br />
And bear through highth or depth of Nature&#8217;s bounds,<br />
With prosperous wing full summed, to tell of deeds<br />
Above heroic, though in secret done,<br />
And unrecorded left through many an age:<br />
Worthy to have not remained so long unsung.</p>
<p>Now had the great Proclaimer, with a voice<br />
More awful than the sound of trumpet, cried<br />
Repentance, and Heaven&#8217;s kingdom nigh at hand<br />
To all baptized. To his great baptism flocked<br />
With awe the regions round, and with them came<br />
From Nazareth the son of Joseph deemed<br />
To the flood Jordan&#8211;came as then obscure,<br />
Unmarked, unknown. But him the Baptist soon<br />
Descried, divinely warned, and witness bore<br />
As to his worthier, and would have resigned<br />
To him his heavenly office. Nor was long<br />
His witness unconfirmed: on him baptized<br />
Heaven opened, and in likeness of a Dove<br />
The Spirit descended, while the Father&#8217;s voice<br />
From Heaven pronounced him his beloved Son.<br />
That heard the Adversary, who, roving still<br />
About the world, at that assembly famed<br />
Would not be last, and, with the voice divine<br />
Nigh thunder-struck, the exalted man to whom<br />
Such high attest was given a while surveyed<br />
With wonder; then, with envy fraught and rage,<br />
Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air<br />
To council summons all his mighty Peers,<br />
Within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved,<br />
A gloomy consistory; and them amidst,<br />
With looks aghast and sad, he thus bespake:&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;O ancient Powers of Air and this wide World<br />
(For much more willingly I mention Air,<br />
This our old conquest, than remember Hell,<br />
Our hated habitation), well ye know<br />
How many ages, as the years of men,<br />
This Universe we have possessed, and ruled<br />
In manner at our will the affairs of Earth,<br />
Since Adam and his facile consort Eve<br />
Lost Paradise, deceived by me, though since<br />
With dread attending when that fatal wound<br />
Shall be inflicted by the seed of Eve<br />
Upon my head. Long the decrees of Heaven<br />
Delay, for longest time to Him is short;<br />
And now, too soon for us, the circling hours<br />
This dreaded time have compassed, wherein we<br />
Must bide the stroke of that long-threatened wound<br />
(At least, if so we can, and by the head<br />
Broken be not intended all our power<br />
To be infringed, our freedom and our being<br />
In this fair empire won of Earth and Air)&#8211;<br />
For this ill news I bring: The Woman&#8217;s Seed,<br />
Destined to this, is late of woman born.<br />
His birth to our just fear gave no small cause;<br />
But his growth now to youth&#8217;s full flower, displaying<br />
All virtue, grace and wisdom to achieve<br />
Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear.<br />
Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim<br />
His coming, is sent harbinger, who all<br />
Invites, and in the consecrated stream<br />
Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so<br />
Purified to receive him pure, or rather<br />
To do him honour as their King. All come,<br />
And he himself among them was baptized&#8211;<br />
Not thence to be more pure, but to receive<br />
The testimony of Heaven, that who he is<br />
Thenceforth the nations may not doubt. I saw<br />
The Prophet do him reverence; on him, rising<br />
Out of the water, Heaven above the clouds<br />
Unfold her crystal doors; thence on his head<br />
A perfet Dove descend (whate&#8217;er it meant);<br />
And out of Heaven the sovraign voice I heard,<br />
&#8216;This is my Son beloved,&#8211;in him am pleased.&#8217;<br />
His mother, than, is mortal, but his Sire<br />
He who obtains the monarchy of Heaven;<br />
And what will He not do to advance his Son?<br />
His first-begot we know, and sore have felt,<br />
When his fierce thunder drove us to the Deep;<br />
Who this is we must learn, for Man he seems<br />
In all his lineaments, though in his face<br />
The glimpses of his Father&#8217;s glory shine.<br />
Ye see our danger on the utmost edge<br />
Of hazard, which admits no long debate,<br />
But must with something sudden be opposed<br />
(Not force, but well-couched fraud, well-woven snares),<br />
Ere in the head of nations he appear,<br />
Their king, their leader, and supreme on Earth.<br />
I, when no other durst, sole undertook<br />
The dismal expedition to find out<br />
And ruin Adam, and the exploit performed<br />
Successfully: a calmer voyage now<br />
Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once<br />
Induces best to hope of like success.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ended, and his words impression left<br />
Of much amazement to the infernal crew,<br />
Distracted and surprised with deep dismay<br />
At these sad tidings. But no time was then<br />
For long indulgence to their fears or grief:<br />
Unanimous they all commit the care<br />
And management of this man enterprise<br />
To him, their great Dictator, whose attempt<br />
At first against mankind so well had thrived<br />
In Adam&#8217;s overthrow, and led their march<br />
From Hell&#8217;s deep-vaulted den to dwell in light,<br />
Regents, and potentates, and kings, yea gods,<br />
Of many a pleasant realm and province wide.<br />
So to the coast of Jordan he directs<br />
His easy steps, girded with snaky wiles,<br />
Where he might likeliest find this new-declared,<br />
This man of men, attested Son of God,<br />
Temptation and all guile on him to try&#8211;<br />
So to subvert whom he suspected raised<br />
To end his reign on Earth so long enjoyed:<br />
But, contrary, unweeting he fulfilled<br />
The purposed counsel, pre-ordained and fixed,<br />
Of the Most High, who, in full frequence bright<br />
Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling spake:&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gabriel, this day, by proof, thou shalt behold,<br />
Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth<br />
With Man or men&#8217;s affairs, how I begin<br />
To verify that solemn message late,<br />
On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure<br />
In Galilee, that she should bear a son,<br />
Great in renown, and called the Son of God.<br />
Then told&#8217;st her, doubting how these things could be<br />
To her a virgin, that on her should come<br />
The Holy Ghost, and the power of the Highest<br />
O&#8217;ershadow her. This Man, born and now upgrown,<br />
To shew him worthy of his birth divine<br />
And high prediction, henceforth I expose<br />
To Satan; let him tempt, and now assay<br />
His utmost subtlety, because he boasts<br />
And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng<br />
Of his Apostasy. He might have learnt<br />
Less overweening, since he failed in Job,<br />
Whose constant perseverance overcame<br />
Whate&#8217;er his cruel malice could invent.<br />
He now shall know I can produce a man,<br />
Of female seed, far abler to resist<br />
All his solicitations, and at length<br />
All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell&#8211;<br />
Winning by conquest what the first man lost<br />
By fallacy surprised. But first I mean<br />
To exercise him in the Wilderness;<br />
There he shall first lay down the rudiments<br />
Of his great warfare, ere I send him forth<br />
To conquer Sin and Death, the two grand foes.<br />
By humiliation and strong sufferance<br />
His weakness shall o&#8217;ercome Satanic strength,<br />
And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh;<br />
That all the Angels and aethereal Powers&#8211;<br />
They now, and men hereafter&#8211;may discern<br />
From what consummate virtue I have chose<br />
This perfet man, by merit called my Son,<br />
To earn salvation for the sons of men.&#8221;</p>
<p>So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven<br />
Admiring stood a space; then into hymns<br />
Burst forth, and in celestial measures moved,<br />
Circling the throne and singing, while the hand<br />
Sung with the voice, and this the argument:&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Victory and triumph to the Son of God,<br />
Now entering his great duel, not of arms,<br />
But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles!<br />
The Father knows the Son; therefore secure<br />
Ventures his filial virtue, though untried,<br />
Against whate&#8217;er may tempt, whate&#8217;er seduce,<br />
Allure, or terrify, or undermine.<br />
Be frustrate, all ye stratagems of Hell,<br />
And, devilish machinations, come to nought!&#8221;</p>
<p>So they in Heaven their odes and vigils tuned.<br />
Meanwhile the Son of God, who yet some days<br />
Lodged in Bethabara, where John baptized,<br />
Musing and much revolving in his breast<br />
How best the mighty work he might begin<br />
Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first<br />
Publish his godlike office now mature,<br />
One day forth walked alone, the Spirit leading<br />
And his deep thoughts, the better to converse<br />
With solitude, till, far from track of men,<br />
Thought following thought, and step by step led on,<br />
He entered now the bordering Desert wild,<br />
And, with dark shades and rocks environed round,<br />
His holy meditations thus pursued:&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;O what a multitude of thoughts at once<br />
Awakened in me swarm, while I consider<br />
What from within I feel myself, and hear<br />
What from without comes often to my ears,<br />
Ill sorting with my present state compared!<br />
When I was yet a child, no childish play<br />
To me was pleasing; all my mind was set<br />
Serious to learn and know, and thence to do,<br />
What might be public good; myself I thought<br />
Born to that end, born to promote all truth,<br />
All righteous things. Therefore, above my years,<br />
The Law of God I read, and found it sweet;<br />
Made it my whole delight, and in it grew<br />
To such perfection that, ere yet my age<br />
Had measured twice six years, at our great Feast<br />
I went into the Temple, there to hear<br />
The teachers of our Law, and to propose<br />
What might improve my knowledge or their own,<br />
And was admired by all. Yet this not all<br />
To which my spirit aspired. Victorious deeds<br />
Flamed in my heart, heroic acts&#8211;one while<br />
To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke;<br />
Then to subdue and quell, o&#8217;er all the earth,<br />
Brute violence and proud tyrannic power,<br />
Till truth were freed, and equity restored:<br />
Yet held it more humane, more heavenly, first<br />
By winning words to conquer willing hearts,<br />
And make persuasion do the work of fear;<br />
At least to try, and teach the erring soul,<br />
Not wilfully misdoing, but unware<br />
Misled; the stubborn only to subdue.<br />
These growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving,<br />
By words at times cast forth, inly rejoiced,<br />
And said to me apart, &#8216;High are thy thoughts,<br />
O Son! but nourish them, and let them soar<br />
To what highth sacred virtue and true worth<br />
Can raise them, though above example high;<br />
By matchless deeds express thy matchless Sire.<br />
For know, thou art no son of mortal man;<br />
Though men esteem thee low of parentage,<br />
Thy Father is the Eternal King who rules<br />
All Heaven and Earth, Angels and sons of men.<br />
A messenger from God foretold thy birth<br />
Conceived in me a virgin; he foretold<br />
Thou shouldst be great, and sit on David&#8217;s throne,<br />
And of thy kingdom there should be no end.<br />
At thy nativity a glorious quire<br />
Of Angels, in the fields of Bethlehem, sung<br />
To shepherds, watching at their folds by night,<br />
And told them the Messiah now was born,<br />
Where they might see him; and to thee they came,<br />
Directed to the manger where thou lay&#8217;st;<br />
For in the inn was left no better room.<br />
A Star, not seen before, in heaven appearing,<br />
Guided the Wise Men thither from the East,<br />
To honour thee with incense, myrrh, and gold;<br />
By whose bright course led on they found the place,<br />
Affirming it thy star, new-graven in heaven,<br />
By which they knew thee King of Israel born.<br />
Just Simeon and prophetic Anna, warned<br />
By vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake,<br />
Before the altar and the vested priest,<br />
Like things of thee to all that present stood.&#8217;<br />
This having heart, straight I again revolved<br />
The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ<br />
Concerning the Messiah, to our scribes<br />
Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake<br />
I am&#8211;this chiefly, that my way must lie<br />
Through many a hard assay, even to the death,<br />
Ere I the promised kingdom can attain,<br />
Or work redemption for mankind, whose sins&#8217;<br />
Full weight must be transferred upon my head.<br />
Yet, neither thus disheartened or dismayed,<br />
The time prefixed I waited; when behold<br />
The Baptist (of whose birth I oft had heard,<br />
Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come<br />
Before Messiah, and his way prepare!<br />
I, as all others, to his baptism came,<br />
Which I believed was from above; but he<br />
Straight knew me, and with loudest voice proclaimed<br />
Me him (for it was shewn him so from Heaven)&#8211;<br />
Me him whose harbinger he was; and first<br />
Refused on me his baptism to confer,<br />
As much his greater, and was hardly won.<br />
But, as I rose out of the laving stream,<br />
Heaven opened her eternal doors, from whence<br />
The Spirit descended on me like a Dove;<br />
And last, the sum of all, my Father&#8217;s voice,<br />
Audibly heard from Heaven, pronounced me his,<br />
Me his beloved Son, in whom alone<br />
He was well pleased: by which I knew the time<br />
Now full, that I no more should live obscure,<br />
But openly begin, as best becomes<br />
The authority which I derived from Heaven.<br />
And now by some strong motion I am led<br />
Into this wilderness; to what intent<br />
I learn not yet. Perhaps I need not know;<br />
For what concerns my knowledge God reveals.&#8221;</p>
<p>So spake our Morning Star, then in his rise,<br />
And, looking round, on every side beheld<br />
A pathless desert, dusk with horrid shades.<br />
The way he came, not having marked return,<br />
Was difficult, by human steps untrod;<br />
And he still on was led, but with such thoughts<br />
Accompanied of things past and to come<br />
Lodged in his breast as well might recommend<br />
Such solitude before choicest society.</p>
<p>Full forty days he passed&#8211;whether on hill<br />
Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night<br />
Under the covert of some ancient oak<br />
Or cedar to defend him from the dew,<br />
Or harboured in one cave, is not revealed;<br />
Nor tasted human food, nor hunger felt,<br />
Till those days ended; hungered then at last<br />
Among wild beasts. They at his sight grew mild,<br />
Nor sleeping him nor waking harmed; his walk<br />
The fiery serpent fled and noxious worm;<br />
The lion and fierce tiger glared aloof.<br />
But now an aged man in rural weeds,<br />
Following, as seemed, the quest of some stray eye,<br />
Or withered sticks to gather, which might serve<br />
Against a winter&#8217;s day, when winds blow keen,<br />
To warm him wet returned from field at eve,<br />
He saw approach; who first with curious eye<br />
Perused him, then with words thus uttered spake:&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place,<br />
So far from path or road of men, who pass<br />
In troop or caravan? for single none<br />
Durst ever, who returned, and dropt not here<br />
His carcass, pined with hunger and with droughth.<br />
I ask the rather, and the more admire,<br />
For that to me thou seem&#8217;st the man whom late<br />
Our new baptizing Prophet at the ford<br />
Of Jordan honoured so, and called thee Son<br />
Of God. I saw and heard, for we sometimes<br />
Who dwell this wild, constrained by want, come forth<br />
To town or village nigh (nighest is far),<br />
Where aught we hear, and curious are to hear,<br />
What happens new; fame also finds us out.&#8221;</p>
<p>To whom the Son of God:&#8211;&#8221;Who brought me hither<br />
Will bring me hence; no other guide I seek.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By miracle he may,&#8221; replied the swain;<br />
&#8220;What other way I see not; for we here<br />
Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inured<br />
More than the camel, and to drink go far&#8211;<br />
Men to much misery and hardship born.<br />
But, if thou be the Son of God, command<br />
That out of these hard stones be made thee bread;<br />
So shalt thou save thyself, and us relieve<br />
With food, whereof we wretched seldom taste.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ended, and the Son of God replied:&#8211;<br />
&#8220;Think&#8217;st thou such force in bread? Is it not written<br />
(For I discern thee other than thou seem&#8217;st),<br />
Man lives not by bread only, but each word<br />
Proceeding from the mouth of God, who fed<br />
Our fathers here with manna? In the Mount<br />
Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank;<br />
And forty days Eliah without food<br />
Wandered this barren waste; the same I now.<br />
Why dost thou, then, suggest to me distrust<br />
Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art?&#8221;</p>
<p>Whom thus answered the Arch-Fiend, now undisguised:&#8211;<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate<br />
Who, leagued with millions more in rash revolt,<br />
Kept not my happy station, but was driven<br />
With them from bliss to the bottomless Deep&#8211;<br />
Yet to that hideous place not so confined<br />
By rigour unconniving but that oft,<br />
Leaving my dolorous prison, I enjoy<br />
Large liberty to round this globe of Earth,<br />
Or range in the Air; nor from the Heaven of Heavens<br />
Hath he excluded my resort sometimes.<br />
I came, among the Sons of God, when he<br />
Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job,<br />
To prove him, and illustrate his high worth;<br />
And, when to all his Angels he proposed<br />
To draw the proud king Ahab into fraud,<br />
That he might fall in Ramoth, they demurring,<br />
I undertook that office, and the tongues<br />
Of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies<br />
To his destruction, as I had in charge:<br />
For what he bids I do. Though I have lost<br />
Much lustre of my native brightness, lost<br />
To be beloved of God, I have not lost<br />
To love, at least contemplate and admire,<br />
What I see excellent in good, or fair,<br />
Or virtuous; I should so have lost all sense.<br />
What can be then less in me than desire<br />
To see thee and approach thee, whom I know<br />
Declared the Son of God, to hear attent<br />
Thy wisdom, and behold thy godlike deeds?<br />
Men generally think me much a foe<br />
To all mankind. Why should I? they to me<br />
Never did wrong or violence. By them<br />
I lost not what I lost; rather by them<br />
I gained what I have gained, and with them dwell<br />
Copartner in these regions of the World,<br />
If not disposer&#8211;lend them oft my aid,<br />
Oft my advice by presages and signs,<br />
And answers, oracles, portents, and dreams,<br />
Whereby they may direct their future life.<br />
Envy, they say, excites me, thus to gain<br />
Companions of my misery and woe!<br />
At first it may be; but, long since with woe<br />
Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof<br />
That fellowship in pain divides not smart,<br />
Nor lightens aught each man&#8217;s peculiar load;<br />
Small consolation, then, were Man adjoined.<br />
This wounds me most (what can it less?) that Man,<br />
Man fallen, shall be restored, I never more.&#8221;</p>
<p>To whom our Saviour sternly thus replied:&#8211;<br />
&#8220;Deservedly thou griev&#8217;st, composed of lies<br />
From the beginning, and in lies wilt end,<br />
Who boast&#8217;st release from Hell, and leave to come<br />
Into the Heaven of Heavens. Thou com&#8217;st, indeed,<br />
As a poor miserable captive thrall<br />
Comes to the place where he before had sat<br />
Among the prime in splendour, now deposed,<br />
Ejected, emptied, gazed, unpitied, shunned,<br />
A spectacle of ruin, or of scorn,<br />
To all the host of Heaven. The happy place<br />
Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy&#8211;<br />
Rather inflames thy torment, representing<br />
Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable;<br />
So never more in Hell than when in Heaven.<br />
But thou art serviceable to Heaven&#8217;s King!<br />
Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear<br />
Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites?<br />
What but thy malice moved thee to misdeem<br />
Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him<br />
With all inflictions? but his patience won.<br />
The other service was thy chosen task,<br />
To be a liar in four hundred mouths;<br />
For lying is thy sustenance, thy food.<br />
Yet thou pretend&#8217;st to truth! all oracles<br />
By thee are given, and what confessed more true<br />
Among the nations? That hath been thy craft,<br />
By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies.<br />
But what have been thy answers? what but dark,<br />
Ambiguous, and with double sense deluding,<br />
Which they who asked have seldom understood,<br />
And, not well understood, as good not known?<br />
Who ever, by consulting at thy shrine,<br />
Returned the wiser, or the more instruct<br />
To fly or follow what concerned him most,<br />
And run not sooner to his fatal snare?<br />
For God hath justly given the nations up<br />
To thy delusions; justly, since they fell<br />
Idolatrous. But, when his purpose is<br />
Among them to declare his providence,<br />
To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth,<br />
But from him, or his Angels president<br />
In every province, who, themselves disdaining<br />
To approach thy temples, give thee in command<br />
What, to the smallest tittle, thou shalt say<br />
To thy adorers? Thou, with trembling fear,<br />
Or like a fawning parasite, obey&#8217;st;<br />
Then to thyself ascrib&#8217;st the truth foretold.<br />
But this thy glory shall be soon retrenched;<br />
No more shalt thou by oracling abuse<br />
The Gentiles; henceforth oracles are ceased,<br />
And thou no more with pomp and sacrifice<br />
Shalt be enquired at Delphos or elsewhere&#8211;<br />
At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute.<br />
God hath now sent his living Oracle<br />
Into the world to teach his final will,<br />
And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell<br />
In pious hearts, an inward oracle<br />
To all truth requisite for men to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend,<br />
Though inly stung with anger and disdain,<br />
Dissembled, and this answer smooth returned:&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke,<br />
And urged me hard with doings which not will,<br />
But misery, hath wrested from me. Where<br />
Easily canst thou find one miserable,<br />
And not inforced oft-times to part from truth,<br />
If it may stand him more in stead to lie,<br />
Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure?<br />
But thou art placed above me; thou art Lord;<br />
From thee I can, and must, submiss, endure<br />
Cheek or reproof, and glad to scape so quit.<br />
Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk,<br />
Smooth on the tongue discoursed, pleasing to the ear,<br />
And tunable as sylvan pipe or song;<br />
What wonder, then, if I delight to hear<br />
Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire<br />
Virtue who follow not her lore. Permit me<br />
To hear thee when I come (since no man comes),<br />
And talk at least, though I despair to attain.<br />
Thy Father, who is holy, wise, and pure,<br />
Suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest<br />
To tread his sacred courts, and minister<br />
About his altar, handling holy things,<br />
Praying or vowing, and voutsafed his voice<br />
To Balaam reprobate, a prophet yet<br />
Inspired: disdain not such access to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>To whom our Saviour, with unaltered brow:&#8211;<br />
&#8220;Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope,<br />
I bid not, or forbid. Do as thou find&#8217;st<br />
Permission from above; thou canst not more.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added not; and Satan, bowling low<br />
His gray dissimulation, disappeared,<br />
Into thin air diffused: for now began<br />
Night with her sullen wing to double-shade<br />
The desert; fowls in their clay nests were couched;<br />
And now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam</p>
