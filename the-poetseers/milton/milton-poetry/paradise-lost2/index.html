				<p>High on a Throne of Royal State, which far<br />
Outshon the wealth of ORMUS and of IND,<br />
Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand<br />
Showrs on her Kings BARBARIC Pearl &amp; Gold,<br />
Satan exalted sat, by merit rais&#8217;d<br />
To that bad eminence; and from despair<br />
Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires<br />
Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue<br />
Vain Warr with Heav&#8217;n, and by success untaught<br />
His proud imaginations thus displaid.</p>
<p>Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav&#8217;n,<br />
For since no deep within her gulf can hold<br />
Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall&#8217;n,<br />
I give not Heav&#8217;n for lost. From this descent<br />
Celestial vertues rising, will appear<br />
More glorious and more dread then from no fall,<br />
And trust themselves to fear no second fate:<br />
Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav&#8217;n<br />
Did first create your Leader, next, free choice,<br />
With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight,<br />
Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss<br />
Thus farr at least recover&#8217;d, hath much more<br />
Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne<br />
Yeilded with full consent. The happier state<br />
In Heav&#8217;n, which follows dignity, might draw<br />
Envy from each inferior; but who here<br />
Will envy whom the highest place exposes<br />
Formost to stand against the Thunderers aime<br />
Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share<br />
Of endless pain? where there is then no good<br />
For which to strive, no strife can grow up there<br />
From Faction; for none sure will claim in hell<br />
Precedence, none, whose portion is so small<br />
Of present pain, that with ambitious mind<br />
Will covet more. With this advantage then<br />
To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord,<br />
More then can be in Heav&#8217;n, we now return<br />
To claim our just inheritance of old,<br />
Surer to prosper then prosperity<br />
Could have assur&#8217;d us; and by what best way,<br />
Whether of open Warr or covert guile,<br />
We now debate; who can advise, may speak.</p>
<p>He ceas&#8217;d, and next him MOLOC, Scepter&#8217;d King<br />
Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit<br />
That fought in Heav&#8217;n; now fiercer by despair:<br />
His trust was with th&#8217; Eternal to be deem&#8217;d<br />
Equal in strength, and rather then be less<br />
Car&#8217;d not to be at all; with that care lost<br />
Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse<br />
He reckd not, and these words thereafter spake.</p>
<p>My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles,<br />
More unexpert, I boast not: them let those<br />
Contrive who need, or when they need, not now.<br />
For while they sit contriving, shall the rest,<br />
Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait<br />
The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here<br />
Heav&#8217;ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place<br />
Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame,<br />
The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns<br />
By our delay? no, let us rather choose<br />
Arm&#8217;d with Hell flames and fury all at once<br />
O&#8217;re Heav&#8217;ns high Towrs to force resistless way,<br />
Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms<br />
Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise<br />
Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear<br />
Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see<br />
Black fire and horror shot with equal rage<br />
Among his Angels; and his Throne it self<br />
Mixt with TARTAREAN Sulphur, and strange fire,<br />
His own invented Torments. But perhaps<br />
The way seems difficult and steep to scale<br />
With upright wing against a higher foe.<br />
Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench<br />
Of that forgetful Lake benumme not still,<br />
That in our proper motion we ascend<br />
Up to our native seat: descent and fall<br />
To us is adverse. Who but felt of late<br />
When the fierce Foe hung on our brok&#8217;n Rear<br />
Insulting, and pursu&#8217;d us through the Deep,<br />
With what compulsion and laborious flight<br />
We sunk thus low? Th&#8217; ascent is easie then;<br />
Th&#8217; event is fear&#8217;d; should we again provoke<br />
Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find<br />
To our destruction: if there be in Hell<br />
Fear to be worse destroy&#8217;d: what can be worse<br />
Then to dwell here, driv&#8217;n out from bliss, condemn&#8217;d<br />
In this abhorred deep to utter woe;<br />
Where pain of unextinguishable fire<br />
Must exercise us without hope of end<br />
The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge<br />
Inexorably, and the torturing houre<br />
Calls us to Penance? More destroy&#8217;d then thus<br />
We should be quite abolisht and expire.<br />
What fear we then? what doubt we to incense<br />
His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag&#8217;d,<br />
Will either quite consume us, and reduce<br />
To nothing this essential, happier farr<br />
Then miserable to have eternal being:<br />
Or if our substance be indeed Divine,<br />
And cannot cease to be, we are at worst<br />
On this side nothing; and by proof we feel<br />
Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav&#8217;n,<br />
And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme,<br />
Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne:<br />
Which if not Victory is yet Revenge.</p>
<p>He ended frowning, and his look denounc&#8217;d<br />
Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous<br />
To less then Gods. On th&#8217; other side up rose<br />
BELIAL, in act more graceful and humane;<br />
A fairer person lost not Heav&#8217;n; he seemd<br />
For dignity compos&#8217;d and high exploit:<br />
But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue<br />
Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear<br />
The better reason, to perplex and dash<br />
Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;<br />
To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds<br />
Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas&#8217;d the eare,<br />
And with perswasive accent thus began.</p>
<p>I should be much for open Warr, O Peers,<br />
As not behind in hate; if what was urg&#8217;d<br />
Main reason to perswade immediate Warr,<br />
Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast<br />
Ominous conjecture on the whole success:<br />
When he who most excels in fact of Arms,<br />
In what he counsels and in what excels<br />
Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair<br />
And utter dissolution, as the scope<br />
Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.<br />
First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav&#8217;n are fill&#8217;d<br />
With Armed watch, that render all access<br />
Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep<br />
Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing<br />
Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night,<br />
Scorning surprize. Or could we break our way<br />
By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise<br />
With blackest Insurrection, to confound<br />
Heav&#8217;ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie<br />
All incorruptible would on his Throne<br />
Sit unpolluted, and th&#8217; Ethereal mould<br />
Incapable of stain would soon expel<br />
Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire<br />
Victorious. Thus repuls&#8217;d, our final hope<br />
Is flat despair: we must exasperate<br />
Th&#8217; Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,<br />
And that must end us, that must be our cure,<br />
To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,<br />
Though full of pain, this intellectual being,<br />
Those thoughts that wander through Eternity,<br />
To perish rather, swallowd up and lost<br />
In the wide womb of uncreated night,<br />
Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows,<br />
Let this be good, whether our angry Foe<br />
Can give it, or will ever? how he can<br />
Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.<br />
Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,<br />
Belike through impotence, or unaware,<br />
To give his Enemies thir wish, and end<br />
Them in his anger, whom his anger saves<br />
To punish endless? wherefore cease we then?<br />
Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed,<br />
Reserv&#8217;d and destin&#8217;d to Eternal woe;<br />
Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,<br />
What can we suffer worse? is this then worst,<br />
Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?<br />
What when we fled amain, pursu&#8217;d and strook<br />
With Heav&#8217;ns afflicting Thunder, and besought<br />
The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem&#8217;d<br />
A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay<br />
Chain&#8217;d on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.<br />
What if the breath that kindl&#8217;d those grim fires<br />
Awak&#8217;d should blow them into sevenfold rage<br />
And plunge us in the Flames? or from above<br />
Should intermitted vengeance Arme again<br />
His red right hand to plague us? what if all<br />
Her stores were op&#8217;n&#8217;d, and this Firmament<br />
Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,<br />
Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall<br />
One day upon our heads; while we perhaps<br />
Designing or exhorting glorious Warr,<br />
Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl&#8217;d<br />
Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey<br />
Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk<br />
Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;<br />
There to converse with everlasting groans,<br />
Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,<br />
Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse.<br />
Warr therefore, open or conceal&#8217;d, alike<br />
My voice disswades; for what can force or guile<br />
With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye<br />
Views all things at one view? he from heav&#8217;ns highth<br />
All these our motions vain, sees and derides;<br />
Not more Almighty to resist our might<br />
Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.<br />
Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav&#8217;n<br />
Thus trampl&#8217;d, thus expell&#8217;d to suffer here<br />
Chains &amp; these Torments? better these then worse<br />
By my advice; since fate inevitable<br />
Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,<br />
The Victors will. To suffer, as to doe,<br />
Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust<br />
That so ordains: this was at first resolv&#8217;d,<br />
If we were wise, against so great a foe<br />
Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.<br />
I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold<br />
And vent&#8217;rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear<br />
What yet they know must follow, to endure<br />
Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,<br />
The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now<br />
Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,<br />
Our Supream Foe in time may much remit<br />
His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov&#8217;d<br />
Not mind us not offending, satisfi&#8217;d<br />
With what is punish&#8217;t; whence these raging fires<br />
Will slack&#8217;n, if his breath stir not thir flames.<br />
Our purer essence then will overcome<br />
Thir noxious vapour, or enur&#8217;d not feel,<br />
Or chang&#8217;d at length, and to the place conformd<br />
In temper and in nature, will receive<br />
Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain;<br />
This horror will grow milde, this darkness light,<br />
Besides what hope the never-ending flight<br />
Of future days may bring, what chance, what change<br />
Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers<br />
For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,<br />
If we procure not to our selves more woe.</p>
<p>Thus BELIAL with words cloath&#8217;d in reasons garb<br />
Counsel&#8217;d ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,<br />
Not peace: and after him thus MAMMON spake.</p>
<p>Either to disinthrone the King of Heav&#8217;n<br />
We warr, if warr be best, or to regain<br />
Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then<br />
May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild<br />
To fickle Chance, and CHAOS judge the strife:<br />
The former vain to hope argues as vain<br />
The latter: for what place can be for us<br />
Within Heav&#8217;ns bound, unless Heav&#8217;ns Lord supream<br />
We overpower? Suppose he should relent<br />
And publish Grace to all, on promise made<br />
Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we<br />
Stand in his presence humble, and receive<br />
Strict Laws impos&#8217;d, to celebrate his Throne<br />
With warbl&#8217;d Hymns, and to his Godhead sing<br />
Forc&#8217;t Halleluiah&#8217;s; while he Lordly sits<br />
Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes<br />
Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,<br />
Our servile offerings. This must be our task<br />
In Heav&#8217;n, this our delight; how wearisom<br />
Eternity so spent in worship paid<br />
To whom we hate. Let us not then pursue<br />
By force impossible, by leave obtain&#8217;d<br />
Unacceptable, though in Heav&#8217;n, our state<br />
Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek<br />
Our own good from our selves, and from our own<br />
Live to our selves, though in this vast recess,<br />
Free, and to none accountable, preferring<br />
Hard liberty before the easie yoke<br />
Of servile Pomp. Our greatness will appear<br />
Then most conspicuous, when great things of small,<br />
Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse<br />
We can create, and in what place so e&#8217;re<br />
Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain<br />
Through labour and endurance. This deep world<br />
Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst<br />
Thick clouds and dark doth Heav&#8217;ns all-ruling Sire<br />
Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur&#8217;d,<br />
And with the Majesty of darkness round<br />
Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar<br />
Must&#8217;ring thir rage, and Heav&#8217;n resembles Hell?<br />
As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light<br />
Imitate when we please? This Desart soile<br />
Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;<br />
Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise<br />
Magnificence; and what can Heav&#8217;n shew more?<br />
Our torments also may in length of time<br />
Become our Elements, these piercing Fires<br />
As soft as now severe, our temper chang&#8217;d<br />
Into their temper; which must needs remove<br />
The sensible of pain. All things invite<br />
To peaceful Counsels, and the settl&#8217;d State<br />
Of order, how in safety best we may<br />
Compose our present evils, with regard<br />
Of what we are and where, dismissing quite<br />
All thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise.</p>
<p>He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld<br />
Th&#8217; Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain<br />
The sound of blustring winds, which all night long<br />
Had rous&#8217;d the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull<br />
Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance<br />
Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay<br />
After the Tempest: Such applause was heard<br />
As MAMMON ended, and his Sentence pleas&#8217;d,<br />
Advising peace: for such another Field<br />
They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear<br />
Of Thunder and the Sword of MICHAEL<br />
Wrought still within them; and no less desire<br />
To found this nether Empire, which might rise<br />
By pollicy, and long process of time,<br />
In emulation opposite to Heav&#8217;n.<br />
Which when BEELZEBUB perceiv&#8217;d, then whom,<br />
SATAN except, none higher sat, with grave<br />
Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem&#8217;d<br />
A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven<br />
Deliberation sat and publick care;<br />
And Princely counsel in his face yet shon,<br />
Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood<br />
With ATLANTEAN shoulders fit to bear<br />
The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look<br />
Drew audience and attention still as Night<br />
Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.</p>
<p>Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav&#8217;n,<br />
Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now<br />
Must we renounce, and changing stile be call&#8217;d<br />
Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote<br />
Inclines, here to continue, and build up here<br />
A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,<br />
And know not that the King of Heav&#8217;n hath doom&#8217;d<br />
This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat<br />
Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt<br />
From Heav&#8217;ns high jurisdiction, in new League<br />
Banded against his Throne, but to remaine<br />
In strictest bondage, though thus far remov&#8217;d,<br />
Under th&#8217; inevitable curb, reserv&#8217;d<br />
His captive multitude: For he, be sure,<br />
In highth or depth, still first and last will Reign<br />
Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part<br />
By our revolt, but over Hell extend<br />
His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule<br />
Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav&#8217;n.<br />
What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr?<br />
Warr hath determin&#8217;d us, and foild with loss<br />
Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none<br />
Voutsaf&#8217;t or sought; for what peace will be giv&#8217;n<br />
To us enslav&#8217;d, but custody severe,<br />
And stripes, and arbitrary punishment<br />
Inflicted? and what peace can we return,<br />
But to our power hostility and hate,<br />
Untam&#8217;d reluctance, and revenge though slow,<br />
Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least<br />
May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce<br />
In doing what we most in suffering feel?<br />
Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need<br />
With dangerous expedition to invade<br />
Heav&#8217;n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,<br />
Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find<br />
Some easier enterprize? There is a place<br />
(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav&#8217;n<br />
Err not) another World, the happy seat<br />
Of som new Race call&#8217;d MAN, about this time<br />
To be created like to us, though less<br />
In power and excellence, but favour&#8217;d more<br />
Of him who rules above; so was his will<br />
Pronounc&#8217;d among the Gods, and by an Oath,<br />
That shook Heav&#8217;ns whol circumference, confirm&#8217;d.<br />
Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn<br />
What creatures there inhabit, of what mould,<br />
Or substance, how endu&#8217;d, and what thir Power,<br />
And where thir weakness, how attempted best,<br />
By force or suttlety: Though Heav&#8217;n be shut,<br />
And Heav&#8217;ns high Arbitrator sit secure<br />
In his own strength, this place may lye expos&#8217;d<br />
The utmost border of his Kingdom, left<br />
To their defence who hold it: here perhaps<br />
Som advantagious act may be achiev&#8217;d<br />
By sudden onset, either with Hell fire<br />
To waste his whole Creation, or possess<br />
All as our own, and drive as we were driven,<br />
The punie habitants, or if not drive,<br />
Seduce them to our Party, that thir God<br />
May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand<br />
Abolish his own works. This would surpass<br />
Common revenge, and interrupt his joy<br />
In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise<br />
In his disturbance; when his darling Sons<br />
Hurl&#8217;d headlong to partake with us, shall curse<br />
Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss,<br />
Faded so soon. Advise if this be worth<br />
Attempting, or to sit in darkness here<br />
Hatching vain Empires. Thus BEELZEBUB<br />
Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis&#8217;d<br />
By SATAN, and in part propos&#8217;d: for whence,<br />
But from the Author of all ill could Spring<br />
So deep a malice, to confound the race<br />
Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell<br />
To mingle and involve, done all to spite<br />
The great Creatour? But thir spite still serves<br />
His glory to augment. The bold design<br />
Pleas&#8217;d highly those infernal States, and joy<br />
Sparkl&#8217;d in all thir eyes; with full assent<br />
They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.</p>
<p>Well have ye judg&#8217;d, well ended long debate,<br />
Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are,<br />
Great things resolv&#8217;d; which from the lowest deep<br />
Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,<br />
Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view<br />
Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms<br />
And opportune excursion we may chance<br />
Re-enter Heav&#8217;n; or else in some milde Zone<br />
Dwell not unvisited of Heav&#8217;ns fair Light<br />
Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam<br />
Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,<br />
To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires<br />
Shall breath her balme. But first whom shall we send<br />
In search of this new world, whom shall we find<br />
Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet<br />
The dark unbottom&#8217;d infinite Abyss<br />
And through the palpable obscure find out<br />
His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight<br />
Upborn with indefatigable wings<br />
Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive<br />
The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then<br />
Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe<br />
Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick<br />
Of Angels watching round? Here he had need<br />
All circumspection, and we now no less<br />
Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,<br />
The weight of all and our last hope relies.</p>
<p>This said, he sat; and expectation held<br />
His look suspence, awaiting who appeer&#8217;d<br />
To second, or oppose, or undertake<br />
The perilous attempt: but all sat mute,<br />
Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; &amp; each<br />
In others count&#8217;nance red his own dismay<br />
Astonisht: none among the choice and prime<br />
Of those Heav&#8217;n-warring Champions could be found<br />
So hardie as to proffer or accept<br />
Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last<br />
SATAN, whom now transcendent glory rais&#8217;d<br />
Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride<br />
Conscious of highest worth, unmov&#8217;d thus spake.</p>
<p>O Progeny of Heav&#8217;n, Empyreal Thrones,<br />
With reason hath deep silence and demurr<br />
Seis&#8217;d us, though undismaid: long is the way<br />
And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light;<br />
Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire,<br />
Outrageous to devour, immures us round<br />
Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant<br />
Barr&#8217;d over us prohibit all egress.<br />
These past, if any pass, the void profound<br />
Of unessential Night receives him next<br />
Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being<br />
Threatens him, plung&#8217;d in that abortive gulf.<br />
If thence he scape into what ever world,<br />
Or unknown Region, what remains him less<br />
Then unknown dangers and as hard escape.<br />
But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers,<br />
And this Imperial Sov&#8217;ranty, adorn&#8217;d<br />
With splendor, arm&#8217;d with power, if aught propos&#8217;d<br />
And judg&#8217;d of public moment, in the shape<br />
Of difficulty or danger could deterre<br />
Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume<br />
These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign,<br />
Refusing to accept as great a share<br />
Of hazard as of honour, due alike<br />
To him who Reigns, and so much to him due<br />
Of hazard more, as he above the rest<br />
High honourd sits? Go therfore mighty powers,<br />
Terror of Heav&#8217;n, though fall&#8217;n; intend at home,<br />
While here shall be our home, what best may ease<br />
The present misery, and render Hell<br />
More tollerable; if there be cure or charm<br />
To respite or deceive, or slack the pain<br />
Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch<br />
Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad<br />
Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek<br />
Deliverance for us all: this enterprize<br />
None shall partake with me. Thus saying rose<br />
The Monarch, and prevented all reply,<br />
Prudent, least from his resolution rais&#8217;d<br />
Others among the chief might offer now<br />
(Certain to be refus&#8217;d) what erst they feard;<br />
And so refus&#8217;d might in opinion stand<br />
His rivals, winning cheap the high repute<br />
Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they<br />
Dreaded not more th&#8217; adventure then his voice<br />
Forbidding; and at once with him they rose;<br />
Thir rising all at once was as the sound<br />
Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend<br />
With awful reverence prone; and as a God<br />
Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav&#8217;n:<br />
Nor fail&#8217;d they to express how much they prais&#8217;d,<br />
That for the general safety he despis&#8217;d<br />
His own: for neither do the Spirits damn&#8217;d<br />
Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast<br />
Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,<br />
Or close ambition varnisht o&#8217;re with zeal.<br />
Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark<br />
Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief:<br />
As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds<br />
Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o&#8217;respread<br />
Heav&#8217;ns chearful face, the lowring Element<br />
Scowls ore the dark&#8217;nd lantskip Snow, or showre;<br />
If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet<br />
Extend his ev&#8217;ning beam, the fields revive,<br />
The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds<br />
Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings.<br />
O shame to men! Devil with Devil damn&#8217;d<br />
Firm concord holds, men onely disagree<br />
Of Creatures rational, though under hope<br />
Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace,<br />
Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife<br />
Among themselves, and levie cruel warres,<br />
Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy:<br />
As if (which might induce us to accord)<br />
Man had not hellish foes anow besides,<br />
That day and night for his destruction waite.</p>
<p>The STYGIAN Councel thus dissolv&#8217;d; and forth<br />
In order came the grand infernal Peers,<br />
Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd<br />
Alone th&#8217; Antagonist of Heav&#8217;n, nor less<br />
Then Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream,<br />
And God-like imitated State; him round<br />
A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos&#8217;d<br />
With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms.<br />
Then of thir Session ended they bid cry<br />
With Trumpets regal sound the great result:<br />
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim<br />
Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie<br />
By Haralds voice explain&#8217;d: the hollow Abyss<br />
Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell<br />
With deafning shout, return&#8217;d them loud acclaim.<br />
Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais&#8217;d<br />
By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers<br />
Disband, and wandring, each his several way<br />
Pursues, as inclination or sad choice<br />
Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find<br />
Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain<br />
The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.<br />
Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime<br />
Upon the wing, or in swift race contend,<br />
As at th&#8217; Olympian Games or PYTHIAN fields;<br />
Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal<br />
With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form.<br />
As when to warn proud Cities warr appears<br />
Wag&#8217;d in the troubl&#8217;d Skie, and Armies rush<br />
To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van<br />
Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears<br />
Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms<br />
From either end of Heav&#8217;n the welkin burns.<br />
Others with vast TYPHOEAN rage more fell<br />
Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air<br />
In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar.<br />
As when ALCIDES from OEALIA Crown&#8217;d<br />
With conquest, felt th&#8217; envenom&#8217;d robe, and tore<br />
Through pain up by the roots THESSALIAN Pines,<br />
And LICHAS from the top of OETA threw<br />
Into th&#8217; EUBOIC Sea. Others more milde,<br />
Retreated in a silent valley, sing<br />
With notes Angelical to many a Harp<br />
Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall<br />
By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate<br />
Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance.<br />
Thir song was partial, but the harmony<br />
(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)<br />
Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment<br />
The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet<br />
(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,)<br />
Others apart sat on a Hill retir&#8217;d,<br />
In thoughts more elevate, and reason&#8217;d high<br />
Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate,<br />
Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,<br />
And found no end, in wandring mazes lost.<br />
Of good and evil much they argu&#8217;d then,<br />
Of happiness and final misery,<br />
Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame,<br />
Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie:<br />
Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm<br />
Pain for a while or anguish, and excite<br />
Fallacious hope, or arm th&#8217; obdured brest<br />
With stubborn patience as with triple steel.<br />
Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands,<br />
On bold adventure to discover wide<br />
That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps<br />
Might yeild them easier habitation, bend<br />
Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks<br />
Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge<br />
Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams;<br />
Abhorred STYX the flood of deadly hate,<br />
Sad ACHERON of sorrow, black and deep;<br />
COCYTUS, nam&#8217;d of lamentation loud<br />
Heard on the ruful stream; fierce PHLEGETON<br />
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.<br />
Farr off from these a slow and silent stream,<br />
LETHE the River of Oblivion roules<br />
Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks,<br />
Forthwith his former state and being forgets,<br />
Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.<br />
Beyond this flood a frozen Continent<br />
Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms<br />
Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land<br />
Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems<br />
Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,<br />
A gulf profound as that SERBONIAN Bog<br />
Betwixt DAMIATA and mount CASIUS old,<br />
Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air<br />
Burns frore, and cold performs th&#8217; effect of Fire.<br />
Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail&#8217;d,<br />
At certain revolutions all the damn&#8217;d<br />
Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change<br />
Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce,<br />
From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice<br />
Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine<br />
Immovable, infixt, and frozen round,<br />
Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire.<br />
They ferry over this LETHEAN Sound<br />
Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment,<br />
And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach<br />
The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose<br />
In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,<br />
All in one moment, and so neer the brink;<br />
But fate withstands, and to oppose th&#8217; attempt<br />
MEDUSA with GORGONIAN terror guards<br />
The Ford, and of it self the water flies<br />
All taste of living wight, as once it fled<br />
The lip of TANTALUS. Thus roving on<br />
In confus&#8217;d march forlorn, th&#8217; adventrous Bands<br />
With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast<br />
View&#8217;d first thir lamentable lot, and found<br />
No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile<br />
They pass&#8217;d, and many a Region dolorous,<br />
O&#8217;re many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe,<br />
Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death,<br />
A Universe of death, which God by curse<br />
Created evil, for evil only good,<br />
Where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds,<br />
Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,<br />
Abominable, inutterable, and worse<br />
Then Fables yet have feign&#8217;d, or fear conceiv&#8217;d,<br />
GORGONS and HYDRA&#8217;S, and CHIMERA&#8217;S dire.</p>
<p>Mean while the Adversary of God and Man,<br />
SATAN with thoughts inflam&#8217;d of highest design,<br />
Puts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell<br />
Explores his solitary flight; som times<br />
He scours the right hand coast, som times the left,<br />
Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares<br />
Up to the fiery concave touring high.<br />
As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri&#8217;d<br />
Hangs in the Clouds, by AEQUINOCTIAL Winds<br />
Close sailing from BENGALA, or the Iles<br />
Of TERNATE and TIDORE, whence Merchants bring<br />
Thir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood<br />
Through the wide ETHIOPIAN to the Cape<br />
Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole. So seem&#8217;d<br />
Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer<br />
Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof,<br />
And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass<br />
Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock,<br />
Impenitrable, impal&#8217;d with circling fire,<br />
Yet unconsum&#8217;d. Before the Gates there sat<br />
On either side a formidable shape;<br />
The one seem&#8217;d Woman to the waste, and fair,<br />
But ended foul in many a scaly fould<br />
Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm&#8217;d<br />
With mortal sting: about her middle round<br />
A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark&#8217;d<br />
With wide CERBEREAN mouths full loud, and rung<br />
A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep,<br />
If aught disturb&#8217;d thir noyse, into her woomb,<br />
And kennel there, yet there still bark&#8217;d and howl&#8217;d<br />
Within unseen. Farr less abhorrd then these<br />
Vex&#8217;d SCYLLA bathing in the Sea that parts<br />
CALABRIA from the hoarce TRINACRIAN shore:<br />
Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call&#8217;d<br />
In secret, riding through the Air she comes<br />
Lur&#8217;d with the smell of infant blood, to dance<br />
With LAPLAND Witches, while the labouring Moon<br />
Eclipses at thir charms. The other shape,<br />
If shape it might be call&#8217;d that shape had none<br />
Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb,<br />
Or substance might be call&#8217;d that shadow seem&#8217;d,<br />
For each seem&#8217;d either; black it stood as Night,<br />
Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,<br />
And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem&#8217;d his head<br />
The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on.<br />
SATAN was now at hand, and from his seat<br />
The Monster moving onward came as fast,<br />
With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode.<br />
Th&#8217; undaunted Fiend what this might be admir&#8217;d,<br />
Admir&#8217;d, not fear&#8217;d; God and his Son except,<br />
Created thing naught vallu&#8217;d he nor shun&#8217;d;<br />
And with disdainful look thus first began.</p>
<p>Whence and what art thou, execrable shape,<br />
That dar&#8217;st, though grim and terrible, advance<br />
Thy miscreated Front athwart my way<br />
To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass,<br />
That be assur&#8217;d, without leave askt of thee:<br />
Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,<br />
Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav&#8217;n.</p>
<p>To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply&#8217;d,<br />
Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee,<br />
Who first broke peace in Heav&#8217;n and Faith, till then<br />
Unbrok&#8217;n, and in proud rebellious Arms<br />
Drew after him the third part of Heav&#8217;ns Sons<br />
Conjur&#8217;d against the highest, for which both Thou<br />
And they outcast from God, are here condemn&#8217;d<br />
To waste Eternal daies in woe and pain?<br />
And reck&#8217;n&#8217;st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav&#8217;n,<br />
Hell-doomd, and breath&#8217;st defiance here and scorn,<br />
Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more,<br />
Thy King and Lord? Back to thy punishment,<br />
False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings,<br />
Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue<br />
Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart<br />
Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before.</p>
<p>So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape,<br />
So speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold<br />
More dreadful and deform: on th&#8217; other side<br />
Incenc&#8217;t with indignation SATAN stood<br />
Unterrifi&#8217;d, and like a Comet burn&#8217;d,<br />
That fires the length of OPHIUCUS huge<br />
In th&#8217; Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair<br />
Shakes Pestilence and Warr. Each at the Head<br />
Level&#8217;d his deadly aime; thir fatall hands<br />
No second stroke intend, and such a frown<br />
Each cast at th&#8217; other, as when two black Clouds<br />
With Heav&#8217;ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on<br />
Over the CASPIAN, then stand front to front<br />
Hov&#8217;ring a space, till Winds the signal blow<br />
To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air:<br />
So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell<br />
Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood;<br />
For never but once more was either like<br />
To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds<br />
Had been achiev&#8217;d, whereof all Hell had rung,<br />
Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat<br />
Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key,<br />
Ris&#8217;n, and with hideous outcry rush&#8217;d between.</p>
<p>O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry&#8217;d,<br />
Against thy only Son? What fury O Son,<br />
Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart<br />
Against thy Fathers head? and know&#8217;st for whom;<br />
For him who sits above and laughs the while<br />
At thee ordain&#8217;d his drudge, to execute<br />
What e&#8217;re his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids,<br />
His wrath which one day will destroy ye both.</p>
<p>She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest<br />
Forbore, then these to her SATAN return&#8217;d:</p>
<p>So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange<br />
Thou interposest, that my sudden hand<br />
Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds<br />
What it intends; till first I know of thee,<br />
What thing thou art, thus double-form&#8217;d, and why<br />
In this infernal Vaile first met thou call&#8217;st<br />
Me Father, and that Fantasm call&#8217;st my Son?<br />
I know thee not, nor ever saw till now<br />
Sight more detestable then him and thee.</p>
<p>T&#8217; whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply&#8217;d;<br />
Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem<br />
Now in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair<br />
In Heav&#8217;n, when at th&#8217; Assembly, and in sight<br />
Of all the Seraphim with thee combin&#8217;d<br />
In bold conspiracy against Heav&#8217;ns King,<br />
All on a sudden miserable pain<br />
Surpris&#8217;d thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm<br />
In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast<br />
Threw forth, till on the left side op&#8217;ning wide,<br />
Likest to thee in shape and count&#8217;nance bright,<br />
Then shining heav&#8217;nly fair, a Goddess arm&#8217;d<br />
Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis&#8217;d<br />
All th&#8217; Host of Heav&#8217;n; back they recoild affraid<br />
At first, and call&#8217;d me SIN, and for a Sign<br />
Portentous held me; but familiar grown,<br />
I pleas&#8217;d, and with attractive graces won<br />
The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft<br />
Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing<br />
Becam&#8217;st enamour&#8217;d, and such joy thou took&#8217;st<br />
With me in secret, that my womb conceiv&#8217;d<br />
A growing burden. Mean while Warr arose,<br />
And fields were fought in Heav&#8217;n; wherein remaind<br />
(For what could else) to our Almighty Foe<br />
Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout<br />
Through all the Empyrean: down they fell<br />
Driv&#8217;n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down<br />
Into this Deep, and in the general fall<br />
I also; at which time this powerful Key<br />
Into my hand was giv&#8217;n, with charge to keep<br />
These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass<br />
Without my op&#8217;ning. Pensive here I sat<br />
Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb<br />
Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown<br />
Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.<br />
At last this odious offspring whom thou seest<br />
Thine own begotten, breaking violent way<br />
Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain<br />
Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew<br />
Transform&#8217;d: but he my inbred enemie<br />
Forth issu&#8217;d, brandishing his fatal Dart<br />
Made to destroy: I fled, and cry&#8217;d out DEATH;<br />
Hell trembl&#8217;d at the hideous Name, and sigh&#8217;d<br />
From all her Caves, and back resounded DEATH.<br />
I fled, but he pursu&#8217;d (though more, it seems,<br />
Inflam&#8217;d with lust then rage) and swifter far,<br />
Me overtook his mother all dismaid,<br />
And in embraces forcible and foule<br />
Ingendring with me, of that rape begot<br />
These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry<br />
Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv&#8217;d<br />
And hourly born, with sorrow infinite<br />
To me, for when they list into the womb<br />
That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw<br />
My Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth<br />
Afresh with conscious terrours vex me round,<br />
That rest or intermission none I find.<br />
Before mine eyes in opposition sits<br />
Grim DEATH my Son and foe, who sets them on,<br />
And me his Parent would full soon devour<br />
For want of other prey, but that he knows<br />
His end with mine involvd; and knows that I<br />
Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane,<br />
When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc&#8217;d.<br />
But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun<br />
His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope<br />
To be invulnerable in those bright Arms,<br />
Though temper&#8217;d heav&#8217;nly, for that mortal dint,<br />
Save he who reigns above, none can resist.</p>
<p>She finish&#8217;d, and the suttle Fiend his lore<br />
Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth.<br />
Dear Daughter, since thou claim&#8217;st me for thy Sire,<br />
And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge<br />
Of dalliance had with thee in Heav&#8217;n, and joys<br />
Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change<br />
Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know<br />
I come no enemie, but to set free<br />
From out this dark and dismal house of pain,<br />
Both him and thee, and all the heav&#8217;nly Host<br />
Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm&#8217;d<br />
Fell with us from on high: from them I go<br />
This uncouth errand sole, and one for all<br />
My self expose, with lonely steps to tread<br />
Th&#8217; unfounded deep, &amp; through the void immense<br />
To search with wandring quest a place foretold<br />
Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now<br />
Created vast and round, a place of bliss<br />
In the Pourlieues of Heav&#8217;n, and therein plac&#8217;t<br />
A race of upstart Creatures, to supply<br />
Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov&#8217;d,<br />
Least Heav&#8217;n surcharg&#8217;d with potent multitude<br />
Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught<br />
Then this more secret now design&#8217;d, I haste<br />
To know, and this once known, shall soon return,<br />
And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death<br />
Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen<br />
Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm&#8217;d<br />
With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill&#8217;d<br />
Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey.<br />
He ceas&#8217;d, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death<br />
Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear<br />
His famine should be fill&#8217;d, and blest his mawe<br />
Destin&#8217;d to that good hour: no less rejoyc&#8217;d<br />
His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire.</p>
<p>The key of this infernal Pit by due,<br />
And by command of Heav&#8217;ns all-powerful King<br />
I keep, by him forbidden to unlock<br />
These Adamantine Gates; against all force<br />
Death ready stands to interpose his dart,<br />
Fearless to be o&#8217;rematcht by living might.<br />
But what ow I to his commands above<br />
Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down<br />
Into this gloom of TARTARUS profound,<br />
To sit in hateful Office here confin&#8217;d,<br />
Inhabitant of Heav&#8217;n, and heav&#8217;nlie-born,<br />
Here in perpetual agonie and pain,<br />
With terrors and with clamors compasst round<br />
Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed:<br />
Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou<br />
My being gav&#8217;st me; whom should I obey<br />
But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon<br />
To that new world of light and bliss, among<br />
The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign<br />
At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems<br />
Thy daughter and thy darling, without end.</p>
<p>Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key,<br />
Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;<br />
And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train,<br />
Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew,<br />
Which but her self not all the STYGIAN powers<br />
Could once have mov&#8217;d; then in the key-hole turns<br />
Th&#8217; intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar<br />
Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease<br />
Unfast&#8217;ns: on a sudden op&#8217;n flie<br />
With impetuous recoile and jarring sound<br />
Th&#8217; infernal dores, and on thir hinges great<br />
Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook<br />
Of EREBUS. She op&#8217;nd, but to shut<br />
Excel&#8217;d her power; the Gates wide op&#8217;n stood,<br />
That with extended wings a Bannerd Host<br />
Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through<br />
With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array;<br />
So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth<br />
Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame.<br />
Before thir eyes in sudden view appear<br />
The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark<br />
Illimitable Ocean without bound,<br />
Without dimension, where length, breadth, and highth,<br />
And time and place are lost; where eldest Night<br />
And CHAOS, Ancestors of Nature, hold<br />
Eternal ANARCHIE, amidst the noise<br />
Of endless warrs and by confusion stand.<br />
For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce<br />
Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring<br />
Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag<br />
Of each his faction, in thir several Clanns,<br />
Light-arm&#8217;d or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow,<br />
Swarm populous, unnumber&#8217;d as the Sands<br />
Of BARCA or CYRENE&#8217;S torrid soil,<br />
Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise<br />
Thir lighter wings. To whom these most adhere,<br />
Hee rules a moment; CHAOS Umpire sits,<br />
And by decision more imbroiles the fray<br />
By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter<br />
CHANCE governs all. Into this wilde Abyss,<br />
The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,<br />
Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,<br />
But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt<br />
Confus&#8217;dly, and which thus must ever fight,<br />
Unless th&#8217; Almighty Maker them ordain<br />
His dark materials to create more Worlds,<br />
Into this wilde Abyss the warie fiend<br />
Stood on the brink of Hell and look&#8217;d a while,<br />
Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith<br />
He had to cross. Nor was his eare less peal&#8217;d<br />
With noises loud and ruinous (to compare<br />
Great things with small) then when BELLONA storms,<br />
With all her battering Engines bent to rase<br />
Som Capital City, or less then if this frame<br />
Of Heav&#8217;n were falling, and these Elements<br />
In mutinie had from her Axle torn<br />
The stedfast Earth. At last his Sail-broad Vannes<br />
He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak<br />
Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League<br />
As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides<br />
Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets<br />
A vast vacuitie: all unawares<br />
Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops<br />
Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour<br />
Down had been falling, had not by ill chance<br />
The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud<br />
Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him<br />
As many miles aloft: that furie stay&#8217;d,<br />
Quencht in a Boggie SYRTIS, neither Sea,<br />
Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares,<br />
Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,<br />
Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile.<br />
As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness<br />
With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale,<br />
Pursues the ARIMASPIAN, who by stelth<br />
Had from his wakeful custody purloind<br />
The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend<br />
Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,<br />
With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way,<br />
And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes:<br />
At length a universal hubbub wilde<br />
Of stunning sounds and voices all confus&#8217;d<br />
Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare<br />
With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes,<br />
Undaunted to meet there what ever power<br />
Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss<br />
Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask<br />
Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes<br />
Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne<br />
Of CHAOS, and his dark Pavilion spread<br />
Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron&#8217;d<br />
Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things,<br />
The consort of his Reign; and by them stood<br />
ORCUS and ADES, and the dreaded name<br />
Of DEMOGORGON; Rumor next and Chance,<br />
And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild,<br />
And Discord with a thousand various mouths.</p>
<p>T&#8217; whom SATAN turning boldly, thus. Ye Powers<br />
And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,<br />
CHAOS and ANCIENT NIGHT, I come no Spie,<br />
With purpose to explore or to disturb<br />
The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint<br />
Wandring this darksome desart, as my way<br />
Lies through your spacious Empire up to light,<br />
Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek<br />
What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds<br />
Confine with Heav&#8217;n; or if som other place<br />
From your Dominion won, th&#8217; Ethereal King<br />
Possesses lately, thither to arrive<br />
I travel this profound, direct my course;<br />
Directed, no mean recompence it brings<br />
To your behoof, if I that Region lost,<br />
All usurpation thence expell&#8217;d, reduce<br />
To her original darkness and your sway<br />
(Which is my present journey) and once more<br />
Erect the Standerd there of ANCIENT NIGHT;<br />
Yours be th&#8217; advantage all, mine the revenge.</p>
<p>Thus SATAN; and him thus the Anarch old<br />
With faultring speech and visage incompos&#8217;d<br />
Answer&#8217;d. I know thee, stranger, who thou art,<br />
That mighty leading Angel, who of late<br />
Made head against Heav&#8217;ns King, though overthrown.<br />
I saw and heard, for such a numerous host<br />
Fled not in silence through the frighted deep<br />
With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,<br />
Confusion worse confounded; and Heav&#8217;n Gates<br />
Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands<br />
Pursuing. I upon my Frontieres here<br />
Keep residence; if all I can will serve,<br />
That little which is left so to defend<br />
Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles<br />
Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell<br />
Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath;<br />
Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World<br />
Hung ore my Realm, link&#8217;d in a golden Chain<br />
To that side Heav&#8217;n from whence your Legions fell:<br />
If that way be your walk, you have not farr;<br />
So much the neerer danger; goe and speed;<br />
Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain.</p>
<p>He ceas&#8217;d; and SATAN staid not to reply,<br />
But glad that now his Sea should find a shore,<br />
With fresh alacritie and force renew&#8217;d<br />
Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire<br />
Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock<br />
Of fighting Elements, on all sides round<br />
Environ&#8217;d wins his way; harder beset<br />
And more endanger&#8217;d, then when ARGO pass&#8217;d<br />
Through BOSPORUS betwixt the justling Rocks:<br />
Or when ULYSSES on the Larbord shunnd<br />
CHARYBDIS, and by th&#8217; other whirlpool steard.<br />
So he with difficulty and labour hard<br />
Mov&#8217;d on, with difficulty and labour hee;<br />
But hee once past, soon after when man fell,<br />
Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain<br />
Following his track, such was the will of Heav&#8217;n,<br />
Pav&#8217;d after him a broad and beat&#8217;n way<br />
Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf<br />
Tamely endur&#8217;d a Bridge of wondrous length<br />
From Hell continu&#8217;d reaching th&#8217; utmost Orbe<br />
Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse<br />
With easie intercourse pass to and fro<br />
To tempt or punish mortals, except whom<br />
God and good Angels guard by special grace.<br />
But now at last the sacred influence<br />
Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav&#8217;n<br />
Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night<br />
A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins<br />
Her fardest verge, and CHAOS to retire<br />
As from her outmost works a brok&#8217;n foe<br />
With tumult less and with less hostile din,<br />
That SATAN with less toil, and now with ease<br />
Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light<br />
And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds<br />
Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn;<br />
Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air,<br />
Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold<br />
Farr off th&#8217; Empyreal Heav&#8217;n, extended wide<br />
In circuit, undetermind square or round,<br />
With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn&#8217;d<br />
Of living Saphire, once his native Seat;<br />
And fast by hanging in a golden Chain<br />
This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr<br />
Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.<br />
Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge,<br />
Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.</p>
