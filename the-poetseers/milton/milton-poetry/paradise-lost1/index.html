				<p>
&nbsp;Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit<br />
Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast<br />
Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,<br />
With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man<br />
Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,<br />
Sing Heav&#8217;nly Muse, that on the secret top<br />
Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire<br />
That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,<br />
In the Beginning how the Heav&#8217;ns and Earth<br />
Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill<br />
Delight thee more, and SILOA&#8217;S Brook that flow&#8217;d<br />
Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence<br />
Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,<br />
That with no middle flight intends to soar<br />
Above th&#8217; AONIAN Mount, while it pursues<br />
Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.<br />
And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer<br />
Before all Temples th&#8217; upright heart and pure,<br />
Instruct me, for Thou know&#8217;st; Thou from the first<br />
Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread<br />
Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss<br />
And mad&#8217;st it pregnant: What in me is dark<br />
Illumine, what is low raise and support;<br />
That to the highth of this great Argument<br />
I may assert th&#8217; Eternal Providence,<br />
And justifie the wayes of God to men.</p>
<p>Say first, for Heav&#8217;n hides nothing from thy view<br />
Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause<br />
Mov&#8217;d our Grand Parents in that happy State,<br />
Favour&#8217;d of Heav&#8217;n so highly, to fall off<br />
From their Creator, and transgress his Will<br />
For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?<br />
Who first seduc&#8217;d them to that fowl revolt?<br />
Th&#8217; infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile<br />
Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv&#8217;d<br />
The Mother of Mankinde, what time his Pride<br />
Had cast him out from Heav&#8217;n, with all his Host<br />
Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring<br />
To set himself in Glory above his Peers,<br />
He trusted to have equal&#8217;d the most High,<br />
If he oppos&#8217;d; and with ambitious aim<br />
Against the Throne and Monarchy of God<br />
Rais&#8217;d impious War in Heav&#8217;n and Battel proud<br />
With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power<br />
Hurld headlong flaming from th&#8217; Ethereal Skie<br />
With hideous ruine and combustion down<br />
To bottomless perdition, there to dwell<br />
In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,<br />
Who durst defie th&#8217; Omnipotent to Arms.<br />
Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night<br />
To mortal men, he with his horrid crew<br />
Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe<br />
Confounded though immortal: But his doom<br />
Reserv&#8217;d him to more wrath; for now the thought<br />
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain<br />
Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes<br />
That witness&#8217;d huge affliction and dismay<br />
Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:<br />
At once as far as Angels kenn he views<br />
The dismal Situation waste and wilde,<br />
A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round<br />
As one great Furnace flam&#8217;d, yet from those flames<br />
No light, but rather darkness visible<br />
Serv&#8217;d only to discover sights of woe,<br />
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace<br />
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes<br />
That comes to all; but torture without end<br />
Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed<br />
With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum&#8217;d:<br />
Such place Eternal Justice had prepar&#8217;d<br />
For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain&#8217;d<br />
In utter darkness, and their portion set<br />
As far remov&#8217;d from God and light of Heav&#8217;n<br />
As from the Center thrice to th&#8217; utmost Pole.<br />
O how unlike the place from whence they fell!<br />
There the companions of his fall, o&#8217;rewhelm&#8217;d<br />
With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,<br />
He soon discerns, and weltring by his side<br />
One next himself in power, and next in crime,<br />
Long after known in PALESTINE, and nam&#8217;d<br />
BEELZEBUB. To whom th&#8217; Arch-Enemy,<br />
And thence in Heav&#8217;n call&#8217;d Satan, with bold words<br />
Breaking the horrid silence thus began.</p>
<p>If thou beest he; But O how fall&#8217;n! how chang&#8217;d<br />
From him, who in the happy Realms of Light<br />
Cloth&#8217;d with transcendent brightnes didst outshine<br />
Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,<br />
United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,<br />
And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,<br />
Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd<br />
In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest<br />
From what highth fal&#8217;n, so much the stronger provd<br />
He with his Thunder: and till then who knew<br />
The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those<br />
Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage<br />
Can else inflict do I repent or change,<br />
Though chang&#8217;d in outward lustre; that fixt mind<br />
And high disdain, from sence of injur&#8217;d merit,<br />
That with the mightiest rais&#8217;d me to contend,<br />
And to the fierce contention brought along<br />
Innumerable force of Spirits arm&#8217;d<br />
That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,<br />
His utmost power with adverse power oppos&#8217;d<br />
In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav&#8217;n,<br />
And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?<br />
All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,<br />
And study of revenge, immortal hate,<br />
And courage never to submit or yield:<br />
And what is else not to be overcome?<br />
That Glory never shall his wrath or might<br />
Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace<br />
With suppliant knee, and deifie his power<br />
Who from the terrour of this Arm so late<br />
Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,<br />
That were an ignominy and shame beneath<br />
This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods<br />
And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,<br />
Since through experience of this great event<br />
In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc&#8217;t,<br />
We may with more successful hope resolve<br />
To wage by force or guile eternal Warr<br />
Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,<br />
Who now triumphs, and in th&#8217; excess of joy<br />
Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav&#8217;n.</p>
<p>So spake th&#8217; Apostate Angel, though in pain,<br />
Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:<br />
And him thus answer&#8217;d soon his bold Compeer.</p>
<p>O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,<br />
That led th&#8217; imbattelld Seraphim to Warr<br />
Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds<br />
Fearless, endanger&#8217;d Heav&#8217;ns perpetual King;<br />
And put to proof his high Supremacy,<br />
Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,<br />
Too well I see and rue the dire event,<br />
That with sad overthrow and foul defeat<br />
Hath lost us Heav&#8217;n, and all this mighty Host<br />
In horrible destruction laid thus low,<br />
As far as Gods and Heav&#8217;nly Essences<br />
Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains<br />
Invincible, and vigour soon returns,<br />
Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state<br />
Here swallow&#8217;d up in endless misery.<br />
But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now<br />
Of force believe Almighty, since no less<br />
Then such could hav orepow&#8217;rd such force as ours)<br />
Have left us this our spirit and strength intire<br />
Strongly to suffer and support our pains,<br />
That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,<br />
Or do him mightier service as his thralls<br />
By right of Warr, what e&#8217;re his business be<br />
Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,<br />
Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;<br />
What can it then avail though yet we feel<br />
Strength undiminisht, or eternal being<br />
To undergo eternal punishment?<br />
Whereto with speedy words th&#8217; Arch-fiend reply&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Fall&#8217;n Cherube, to be weak is miserable<br />
Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,<br />
To do ought good never will be our task,<br />
But ever to do ill our sole delight,<br />
As being the contrary to his high will<br />
Whom we resist. If then his Providence<br />
Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,<br />
Our labour must be to pervert that end,<br />
And out of good still to find means of evil;<br />
Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps<br />
Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb<br />
His inmost counsels from their destind aim.<br />
But see the angry Victor hath recall&#8217;d<br />
His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit<br />
Back to the Gates of Heav&#8217;n: The Sulphurous Hail<br />
Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid<br />
The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice<br />
Of Heav&#8217;n receiv&#8217;d us falling, and the Thunder,<br />
Wing&#8217;d with red Lightning and impetuous rage,<br />
Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now<br />
To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.<br />
Let us not slip th&#8217; occasion, whether scorn,<br />
Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.<br />
Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,<br />
The seat of desolation, voyd of light,<br />
Save what the glimmering of these livid flames<br />
Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend<br />
From off the tossing of these fiery waves,<br />
There rest, if any rest can harbour there,<br />
And reassembling our afflicted Powers,<br />
Consult how we may henceforth most offend<br />
Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,<br />
How overcome this dire Calamity,<br />
What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,<br />
If not what resolution from despare.</p>
<p>Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate<br />
With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes<br />
That sparkling blaz&#8217;d, his other Parts besides<br />
Prone on the Flood, extended long and large<br />
Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge<br />
As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,<br />
TITANIAN, or EARTH-BORN, that warr&#8217;d on JOVE,<br />
BRIARIOS or TYPHON, whom the Den<br />
By ancient TARSUS held, or that Sea-beast<br />
LEVIATHAN, which God of all his works<br />
Created hugest that swim th&#8217; Ocean stream:<br />
Him haply slumbring on the NORWAY foam<br />
The Pilot of some small night-founder&#8217;d Skiff,<br />
Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,<br />
With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind<br />
Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night<br />
Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:<br />
So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay<br />
Chain&#8217;d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence<br />
Had ris&#8217;n or heav&#8217;d his head, but that the will<br />
And high permission of all-ruling Heaven<br />
Left him at large to his own dark designs,<br />
That with reiterated crimes he might<br />
Heap on himself damnation, while he sought<br />
Evil to others, and enrag&#8217;d might see<br />
How all his malice serv&#8217;d but to bring forth<br />
Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn<br />
On Man by him seduc&#8217;t, but on himself<br />
Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour&#8217;d.<br />
Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool<br />
His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames<br />
Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, &amp; rowld<br />
In billows, leave i&#8217;th&#8217; midst a horrid Vale.<br />
Then with expanded wings he stears his flight<br />
Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air<br />
That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land<br />
He lights, if it were Land that ever burn&#8217;d<br />
With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;<br />
And such appear&#8217;d in hue, as when the force<br />
Of subterranean wind transports a Hill<br />
Torn from PELORUS, or the shatter&#8217;d side<br />
Of thundring AETNA, whose combustible<br />
And fewel&#8217;d entrals thence conceiving Fire,<br />
Sublim&#8217;d with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,<br />
And leave a singed bottom all involv&#8217;d<br />
With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole<br />
Of unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate,<br />
Both glorying to have scap&#8217;t the STYGIAN flood<br />
As Gods, and by their own recover&#8217;d strength,<br />
Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.</p>
<p>Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,<br />
Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat<br />
That we must change for Heav&#8217;n, this mournful gloom<br />
For that celestial light? Be it so, since hee<br />
Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid<br />
What shall be right: fardest from him is best<br />
Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream<br />
Above his equals. Farewel happy Fields<br />
Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail<br />
Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell<br />
Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings<br />
A mind not to be chang&#8217;d by Place or Time.<br />
The mind is its own place, and in it self<br />
Can make a Heav&#8217;n of Hell, a Hell of Heav&#8217;n.<br />
What matter where, if I be still the same,<br />
And what I should be, all but less then hee<br />
Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least<br />
We shall be free; th&#8217; Almighty hath not built<br />
Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:<br />
Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce<br />
To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:<br />
Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav&#8217;n.<br />
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,<br />
Th&#8217; associates and copartners of our loss<br />
Lye thus astonisht on th&#8217; oblivious Pool,<br />
And call them not to share with us their part<br />
In this unhappy Mansion, or once more<br />
With rallied Arms to try what may be yet<br />
Regaind in Heav&#8217;n, or what more lost in Hell?</p>
<p>So SATAN spake, and him BEELZEBUB<br />
Thus answer&#8217;d. Leader of those Armies bright,<br />
Which but th&#8217; Omnipotent none could have foyld,<br />
If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge<br />
Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft<br />
In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge<br />
Of battel when it rag&#8217;d, in all assaults<br />
Their surest signal, they will soon resume<br />
New courage and revive, though now they lye<br />
Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,<br />
As we erewhile, astounded and amaz&#8217;d,<br />
No wonder, fall&#8217;n such a pernicious highth.</p>
<p>He scarce had ceas&#8217;t when the superiour Fiend<br />
Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield<br />
Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,<br />
Behind him cast; the broad circumference<br />
Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb<br />
Through Optic Glass the TUSCAN Artist views<br />
At Ev&#8217;ning from the top of FESOLE,<br />
Or in VALDARNO, to descry new Lands,<br />
Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.<br />
His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine<br />
Hewn on NORWEGIAN hills, to be the Mast<br />
Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,<br />
He walkt with to support uneasie steps<br />
Over the burning Marle, not like those steps<br />
On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime<br />
Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;<br />
Nathless he so endur&#8217;d, till on the Beach<br />
Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call&#8217;d<br />
His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans&#8217;t<br />
Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks<br />
In VALLOMBROSA, where th&#8217; ETRURIAN shades<br />
High overarch&#8217;t imbowr; or scatterd sedge<br />
Afloat, when with fierce Winds ORION arm&#8217;d<br />
Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew<br />
BUSIRIS and his MEMPHIAN Chivalrie,<br />
VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu&#8217;d<br />
The Sojourners of GOSHEN, who beheld<br />
From the safe shore their floating Carkases<br />
And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown<br />
Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,<br />
Under amazement of their hideous change.<br />
He call&#8217;d so loud, that all the hollow Deep<br />
Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates,<br />
Warriers, the Flowr of Heav&#8217;n, once yours, now lost,<br />
If such astonishment as this can sieze<br />
Eternal spirits; or have ye chos&#8217;n this place<br />
After the toyl of Battel to repose<br />
Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find<br />
To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav&#8217;n?<br />
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn<br />
To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds<br />
Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood<br />
With scatter&#8217;d Arms and Ensigns, till anon<br />
His swift pursuers from Heav&#8217;n Gates discern<br />
Th&#8217; advantage, and descending tread us down<br />
Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts<br />
Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.<br />
Awake, arise, or be for ever fall&#8217;n.</p>
<p>They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung<br />
Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch<br />
On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,<br />
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.<br />
Nor did they not perceave the evil plight<br />
In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;<br />
Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd<br />
Innumerable. As when the potent Rod<br />
Of AMRAMS Son in EGYPTS evill day<br />
Wav&#8217;d round the Coast, up call&#8217;d a pitchy cloud<br />
Of LOCUSTS, warping on the Eastern Wind,<br />
That ore the Realm of impious PHAROAH hung<br />
Like Night, and darken&#8217;d all the Land of NILE:<br />
So numberless were those bad Angels seen<br />
Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell<br />
&#8216;Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;<br />
Till, as a signal giv&#8217;n, th&#8217; uplifted Spear<br />
Of their great Sultan waving to direct<br />
Thir course, in even ballance down they light<br />
On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;<br />
A multitude, like which the populous North<br />
Pour&#8217;d never from her frozen loyns, to pass<br />
RHENE or the DANAW, when her barbarous Sons<br />
Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread<br />
Beneath GIBRALTAR to the LYBIAN sands.<br />
Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band<br />
The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood<br />
Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms<br />
Excelling human, Princely Dignities,<br />
And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;<br />
Though of their Names in heav&#8217;nly Records now<br />
Be no memorial, blotted out and ras&#8217;d<br />
By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.<br />
Nor had they yet among the Sons of EVE<br />
Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,<br />
Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,<br />
By falsities and lyes the greatest part<br />
Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake<br />
God their Creator, and th&#8217; invisible<br />
Glory of him, that made them, to transform<br />
Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn&#8217;d<br />
With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,<br />
And Devils to adore for Deities:<br />
Then were they known to men by various Names,<br />
And various Idols through the Heathen World.<br />
Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,<br />
Rous&#8217;d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,<br />
At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth<br />
Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,<br />
While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?<br />
The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell<br />
Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix<br />
Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,<br />
Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador&#8217;d<br />
Among the Nations round, and durst abide<br />
JEHOVAH thundring out of SION, thron&#8217;d<br />
Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac&#8217;d<br />
Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,<br />
Abominations; and with cursed things<br />
His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan&#8217;d,<br />
And with their darkness durst affront his light.<br />
First MOLOCH, horrid King besmear&#8217;d with blood<br />
Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,<br />
Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud<br />
Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire<br />
To his grim Idol. Him the AMMONITE<br />
Worshipt in RABBA and her watry Plain,<br />
In ARGOB and in BASAN, to the stream<br />
Of utmost ARNON. Nor content with such<br />
Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart<br />
Of SOLOMON he led by fraud to build<br />
His Temple right against the Temple of God<br />
On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove<br />
The pleasant Vally of HINNOM, TOPHET thence<br />
And black GEHENNA call&#8217;d, the Type of Hell.<br />
Next CHEMOS, th&#8217; obscene dread of MOABS Sons,<br />
From AROER to NEBO, and the wild<br />
Of Southmost ABARIM; in HESEBON<br />
And HERONAIM, SEONS Realm, beyond<br />
The flowry Dale of SIBMA clad with Vines,<br />
And ELEALE to th&#8217; ASPHALTICK Pool.<br />
PEOR his other Name, when he entic&#8217;d<br />
ISRAEL in SITTIM on their march from NILE<br />
To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.<br />
Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg&#8217;d<br />
Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove<br />
Of MOLOCH homicide, lust hard by hate;<br />
Till good JOSIAH drove them thence to Hell.<br />
With these came they, who from the bordring flood<br />
Of old EUPHRATES to the Brook that parts<br />
EGYPT from SYRIAN ground, had general Names<br />
Of BAALIM and ASHTAROTH, those male,<br />
These Feminine. For Spirits when they please<br />
Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft<br />
And uncompounded is their Essence pure,<br />
Not ti&#8217;d or manacl&#8217;d with joynt or limb,<br />
Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,<br />
Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose<br />
Dilated or condens&#8217;t, bright or obscure,<br />
Can execute their aerie purposes,<br />
And works of love or enmity fulfill.<br />
For those the Race of ISRAEL oft forsook<br />
Their living strength, and unfrequented left<br />
His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down<br />
To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low<br />
Bow&#8217;d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear<br />
Of despicable foes. With these in troop<br />
Came ASTORETH, whom the PHOENICIANS call&#8217;d<br />
ASTARTE, Queen of Heav&#8217;n, with crescent Horns;<br />
To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon<br />
SIDONIAN Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,<br />
In SION also not unsung, where stood<br />
Her Temple on th&#8217; offensive Mountain, built<br />
By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,<br />
Beguil&#8217;d by fair Idolatresses, fell<br />
To Idols foul. THAMMUZ came next behind,<br />
Whose annual wound in LEBANON allur&#8217;d<br />
The SYRIAN Damsels to lament his fate<br />
In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,<br />
While smooth ADONIS from his native Rock<br />
Ran purple to the Sea, suppos&#8217;d with blood<br />
Of THAMMUZ yearly wounded: the Love-tale<br />
Infected SIONS daughters with like heat,<br />
Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch<br />
EZEKIEL saw, when by the Vision led<br />
His eye survay&#8217;d the dark Idolatries<br />
Of alienated JUDAH. Next came one<br />
Who mourn&#8217;d in earnest, when the Captive Ark<br />
Maim&#8217;d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off<br />
In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,<br />
Where he fell flat, and sham&#8217;d his Worshipers:<br />
DAGON his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man<br />
And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high<br />
Rear&#8217;d in AZOTUS, dreaded through the Coast<br />
Of PALESTINE, in GATH and ASCALON,<br />
And ACCARON and GAZA&#8217;s frontier bounds.<br />
Him follow&#8217;d RIMMON, whose delightful Seat<br />
Was fair DAMASCUS, on the fertil Banks<br />
Of ABBANA and PHARPHAR, lucid streams.<br />
He also against the house of God was bold:<br />
A Leper once he lost and gain&#8217;d a King,<br />
AHAZ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew<br />
Gods Altar to disparage and displace<br />
For one of SYRIAN mode, whereon to burn<br />
His odious offrings, and adore the Gods<br />
Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear&#8217;d<br />
A crew who under Names of old Renown,<br />
OSIRIS, ISIS, ORUS and their Train<br />
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus&#8217;d<br />
Fanatic EGYPT and her Priests, to seek<br />
Thir wandring Gods disguis&#8217;d in brutish forms<br />
Rather then human. Nor did ISRAEL scape<br />
Th&#8217; infection when their borrow&#8217;d Gold compos&#8217;d<br />
The Calf in OREB: and the Rebel King<br />
Doubl&#8217;d that sin in BETHEL and in DAN,<br />
Lik&#8217;ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,<br />
JEHOVAH, who in one Night when he pass&#8217;d<br />
From EGYPT marching, equal&#8217;d with one stroke<br />
Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.<br />
BELIAL came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd<br />
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love<br />
Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood<br />
Or Altar smoak&#8217;d; yet who more oft then hee<br />
In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest<br />
Turns Atheist, as did ELY&#8217;S Sons, who fill&#8217;d<br />
With lust and violence the house of God.<br />
In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns<br />
And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse<br />
Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,<br />
And injury and outrage: And when Night<br />
Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons<br />
Of BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine.<br />
Witness the Streets of SODOM, and that night<br />
In GIBEAH, when hospitable Dores<br />
Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.<br />
These were the prime in order and in might;<br />
The rest were long to tell, though far renown&#8217;d,<br />
Th&#8217; IONIAN Gods, of JAVANS Issue held<br />
Gods, yet confest later then Heav&#8217;n and Earth<br />
Thir boasted Parents; TITAN Heav&#8217;ns first born<br />
With his enormous brood, and birthright seis&#8217;d<br />
By younger SATURN, he from mightier JOVE<br />
His own and RHEA&#8217;S Son like measure found;<br />
So JOVE usurping reign&#8217;d: these first in CREET<br />
And IDA known, thence on the Snowy top<br />
Of cold OLYMPUS rul&#8217;d the middle Air<br />
Thir highest Heav&#8217;n; or on the DELPHIAN Cliff,<br />
Or in DODONA, and through all the bounds<br />
Of DORIC Land; or who with SATURN old<br />
Fled over ADRIA to th&#8217; HESPERIAN Fields,<br />
And ore the CELTIC roam&#8217;d the utmost Isles.<br />
All these and more came flocking; but with looks<br />
Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear&#8217;d<br />
Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief<br />
Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost<br />
In loss it self; which on his count&#8217;nance cast<br />
Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride<br />
Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore<br />
Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais&#8217;d<br />
Their fainted courage, and dispel&#8217;d their fears.<br />
Then strait commands that at the warlike sound<br />
Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard<br />
His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim&#8217;d<br />
AZAZEL as his right, a Cherube tall:<br />
Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld<br />
Th&#8217; Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc&#8217;t<br />
Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind<br />
With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz&#8217;d,<br />
Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while<br />
Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:<br />
At which the universal Host upsent<br />
A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond<br />
Frighted the Reign of CHAOS and old Night.<br />
All in a moment through the gloom were seen<br />
Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air<br />
With Orient Colours waving: with them rose<br />
A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms<br />
Appear&#8217;d, and serried Shields in thick array<br />
Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move<br />
In perfect PHALANX to the Dorian mood<br />
Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais&#8217;d<br />
To highth of noblest temper Hero&#8217;s old<br />
Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage<br />
Deliberate valour breath&#8217;d, firm and unmov&#8217;d<br />
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,<br />
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage<br />
With solemn touches, troubl&#8217;d thoughts, and chase<br />
Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain<br />
From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they<br />
Breathing united force with fixed thought<br />
Mov&#8217;d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm&#8217;d<br />
Thir painful steps o&#8217;re the burnt soyle; and now<br />
Advanc&#8217;t in view they stand, a horrid Front<br />
Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise<br />
Of Warriers old with order&#8217;d Spear and Shield,<br />
Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief<br />
Had to impose: He through the armed Files<br />
Darts his experienc&#8217;t eye, and soon traverse<br />
The whole Battalion views, thir order due,<br />
Thir visages and stature as of Gods,<br />
Thir number last he summs. And now his heart<br />
Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength<br />
Glories: For never since created man,<br />
Met such imbodied force, as nam&#8217;d with these<br />
Could merit more then that small infantry<br />
Warr&#8217;d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood<br />
Of PHLEGRA with th&#8217; Heroic Race were joyn&#8217;d<br />
That fought at THEB&#8217;S and ILIUM, on each side<br />
Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds<br />
In Fable or ROMANCE of UTHERS Son<br />
Begirt with BRITISH and ARMORIC Knights;<br />
And all who since, Baptiz&#8217;d or Infidel<br />
Jousted in ASPRAMONT or MONTALBAN,<br />
DAMASCO, or MAROCCO, or TREBISOND,<br />
Or whom BISERTA sent from AFRIC shore<br />
When CHARLEMAIN with all his Peerage fell<br />
By FONTARABBIA. Thus far these beyond<br />
Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ&#8217;d<br />
Thir dread Commander: he above the rest<br />
In shape and gesture proudly eminent<br />
Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost<br />
All her Original brightness, nor appear&#8217;d<br />
Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th&#8217; excess<br />
Of Glory obscur&#8217;d: As when the Sun new ris&#8217;n<br />
Looks through the Horizontal misty Air<br />
Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon<br />
In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds<br />
On half the Nations, and with fear of change<br />
Perplexes Monarchs. Dark&#8217;n&#8217;d so, yet shon<br />
Above them all th&#8217; Arch Angel: but his face<br />
Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care<br />
Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes<br />
Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride<br />
Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast<br />
Signs of remorse and passion to behold<br />
The fellows of his crime, the followers rather<br />
(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn&#8217;d<br />
For ever now to have their lot in pain,<br />
Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc&#8217;t<br />
Of Heav&#8217;n, and from Eternal Splendors flung<br />
For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,<br />
Thir Glory witherd. As when Heavens Fire<br />
Hath scath&#8217;d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,<br />
With singed top their stately growth though bare<br />
Stands on the blasted Heath. He now prepar&#8217;d<br />
To speak; whereat their doubl&#8217;d Ranks they bend<br />
From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round<br />
With all his Peers: attention held them mute.<br />
Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,<br />
Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last<br />
Words interwove with sighs found out their way.</p>
<p>O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers<br />
Matchless, but with th&#8217; Almighty, and that strife<br />
Was not inglorious, though th&#8217; event was dire,<br />
As this place testifies, and this dire change<br />
Hateful to utter: but what power of mind<br />
Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth<br />
Of knowledge past or present, could have fear&#8217;d,<br />
How such united force of Gods, how such<br />
As stood like these, could ever know repulse?<br />
For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,<br />
That all these puissant Legions, whose exile<br />
Hath emptied Heav&#8217;n, shall faile to re-ascend<br />
Self-rais&#8217;d, and repossess their native seat.<br />
For me, be witness all the Host of Heav&#8217;n,<br />
If counsels different, or danger shun&#8217;d<br />
By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns<br />
Monarch in Heav&#8217;n, till then as one secure<br />
Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,<br />
Consent or custome, and his Regal State<br />
Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal&#8217;d,<br />
Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.<br />
Henceforth his might we know, and know our own<br />
So as not either to provoke, or dread<br />
New warr, provok&#8217;t; our better part remains<br />
To work in close design, by fraud or guile<br />
What force effected not: that he no less<br />
At length from us may find, who overcomes<br />
By force, hath overcome but half his foe.<br />
Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife<br />
There went a fame in Heav&#8217;n that he ere long<br />
Intended to create, and therein plant<br />
A generation, whom his choice regard<br />
Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:<br />
Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps<br />
Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:<br />
For this Infernal Pit shall never hold<br />
Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th&#8217; Abysse<br />
Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts<br />
Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,<br />
For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr<br />
Open or understood must be resolv&#8217;d.</p>
<p>He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew<br />
Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs<br />
Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze<br />
Far round illumin&#8217;d hell: highly they rag&#8217;d<br />
Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm&#8217;s<br />
Clash&#8217;d on their sounding shields the din of war,<br />
Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav&#8217;n.</p>
<p>There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top<br />
Belch&#8217;d fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire<br />
Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign<br />
That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,<br />
The work of Sulphur. Thither wing&#8217;d with speed<br />
A numerous Brigad hasten&#8217;d. As when bands<br />
Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm&#8217;d<br />
Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,<br />
Or cast a Rampart. MAMMON led them on,<br />
MAMMON, the least erected Spirit that fell<br />
From heav&#8217;n, for ev&#8217;n in heav&#8217;n his looks &amp; thoughts<br />
Were always downward bent, admiring more<br />
The riches of Heav&#8217;ns pavement, trod&#8217;n Gold,<br />
Then aught divine or holy else enjoy&#8217;d<br />
In vision beatific: by him first<br />
Men also, and by his suggestion taught,<br />
Ransack&#8217;d the Center, and with impious hands<br />
Rifl&#8217;d the bowels of thir mother Earth<br />
For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew<br />
Op&#8217;nd into the Hill a spacious wound<br />
And dig&#8217;d out ribs of Gold. Let none admire<br />
That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best<br />
Deserve the pretious bane. And here let those<br />
Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell<br />
Of BABEL, and the works of MEMPHIAN Kings,<br />
Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,<br />
And Strength and Art are easily outdone<br />
By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour<br />
What in an age they with incessant toyle<br />
And hands innumerable scarce perform<br />
Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar&#8217;d,<br />
That underneath had veins of liquid fire<br />
Sluc&#8217;d from the Lake, a second multitude<br />
With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,<br />
Severing each kinde, and scum&#8217;d the Bullion dross:<br />
A third as soon had form&#8217;d within the ground<br />
A various mould, and from the boyling cells<br />
By strange conveyance fill&#8217;d each hollow nook,<br />
As in an Organ from one blast of wind<br />
To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.<br />
Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge<br />
Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound<br />
Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,<br />
Built like a Temple, where PILASTERS round<br />
Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid<br />
With Golden Architrave; nor did there want<br />
Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav&#8217;n,<br />
The Roof was fretted Gold. Not BABILON,<br />
Nor great ALCAIRO such magnificence<br />
Equal&#8217;d in all thir glories, to inshrine<br />
BELUS or SERAPIS thir Gods, or seat<br />
Thir Kings, when AEGYPT with ASSYRIA strove<br />
In wealth and luxurie. Th&#8217; ascending pile<br />
Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores<br />
Op&#8217;ning thir brazen foulds discover wide<br />
Within, her ample spaces, o&#8217;re the smooth<br />
And level pavement: from the arched roof<br />
Pendant by suttle Magic many a row<br />
Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed<br />
With Naphtha and ASPHALTUS yeilded light<br />
As from a sky. The hasty multitude<br />
Admiring enter&#8217;d, and the work some praise<br />
And some the Architect: his hand was known<br />
In Heav&#8217;n by many a Towred structure high,<br />
Where Scepter&#8217;d Angels held thir residence,<br />
And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King<br />
Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,<br />
Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.<br />
Nor was his name unheard or unador&#8217;d<br />
In ancient Greece; and in AUSONIAN land<br />
Men call&#8217;d him MULCIBER; and how he fell<br />
From Heav&#8217;n, they fabl&#8217;d, thrown by angry JOVE<br />
Sheer o&#8217;re the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn<br />
To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,<br />
A Summers day; and with the setting Sun<br />
Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,<br />
On LEMNOS th&#8217; AEGAEAN Ile: thus they relate,<br />
Erring; for he with this rebellious rout<br />
Fell long before; nor aught avail&#8217;d him now<br />
To have built in Heav&#8217;n high Towrs; nor did he scape<br />
By all his Engins, but was headlong sent<br />
With his industrious crew to build in hell.<br />
Mean while the winged Haralds by command<br />
Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony<br />
And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim<br />
A solemn Councel forthwith to be held<br />
At PANDAEMONIUM, the high Capital<br />
Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call&#8217;d<br />
From every and Band squared Regiment<br />
By place or choice the worthiest; they anon<br />
With hundreds and with thousands trooping came<br />
Attended: all access was throng&#8217;d, the Gates<br />
And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall<br />
(Though like a cover&#8217;d field, where Champions bold<br />
Wont ride in arm&#8217;d, and at the Soldans chair<br />
Defi&#8217;d the best of Panim chivalry<br />
To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)<br />
Thick swarm&#8217;d, both on the ground and in the air,<br />
Brusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees<br />
In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,<br />
Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive<br />
In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers<br />
Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,<br />
The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,<br />
New rub&#8217;d with Baume, expatiate and confer<br />
Thir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd<br />
Swarm&#8217;d and were straitn&#8217;d; till the Signal giv&#8217;n,<br />
Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd<br />
In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons<br />
Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room<br />
Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race<br />
Beyond the INDIAN Mount, or Faerie Elves,<br />
Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side<br />
Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees,<br />
Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon<br />
Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth<br />
Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth &amp; dance<br />
Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;<br />
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.<br />
Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms<br />
Reduc&#8217;d thir shapes immense, and were at large,<br />
Though without number still amidst the Hall<br />
Of that infernal Court. But far within<br />
And in thir own dimensions like themselves<br />
The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim<br />
In close recess and secret conclave sat<br />
A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat&#8217;s,<br />
Frequent and full. After short silence then<br />
And summons read, the great consult began.</p>
